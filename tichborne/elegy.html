<h1>Elegy</h1>
<h2>by Chidiock Tichborne (1586)</h2>
<p>
My prime of youth is but a frost of cares,<br/>
My feast of joy is but a dish of pain,<br/>
My crop of corn is but a field of tares,<br/>
And all my good is but vain hope of gain.<br/>
The day is gone and yet I saw no sun,<br/>
And now I live, and now my life is done.
</p>
<p>
The spring is past, and yet it hath not sprung,<br/>
The fruit is dead, and yet the leaves are green,<br/>
My youth is gone, and yet I am but young,<br/>
I saw the world, and yet I was not seen,<br/>
My thread is cut, and yet it was not spun,<br/>
And now I live, and now my life is done.
</p>
<p>
I sought my death and found it in my womb,<br/>
I lookt for life and saw it was a shade,<br/>
I trode the earth and knew it was my tomb,<br/>
And now I die, and now I am but made.<br/>
The glass is full, and now the glass is run,<br/>
And now I live, and now my life is done.

<h1>On my dear Grand-child</h1>
<h2>by Anne Bradstreet</h2>
<p>
No sooner came, but gone, and fall'n asleep,<br/>
Acquaintance short, yet parting caused us weep;<br/>
Three flowers, two scarcely blown, the last I' th' bud,<br/>
Cropt by th' Almighty's hand; yet is He good.<br/>
With dreadful awe before Him let's be mute,<br/>
Such was His will, but why, let's not dispute,<br/>
With humble hearts and moths put in the dust,<br/>
Let's say He's merciful as well as just.<br/>
He will return and make up all our losses,<br/>
And smile again after our bitter crosses<br/>
Go pretty babe, go rest with sisters twain;<br/>
Among the blest in endless joys remain.<br/>

<h1>In Memory of My Dear Grandchild Elizabeth Bradstreet</h1>
<h2>by Anne Bradstreet</h2>
<p>
Farewell dear babe, my heart's too much content,<br/>
Farewell sweet babe, the pleasure of mine eye,<br/>
Farewell fair flower that for a space was lent,<br/>
Then ta'en away unto eternity.<br/>
Blest babe why should I once bewail thy fate,<br/>
Or sigh the days so soon were terminate;<br/>
Sith thou art settled in an everlasting state.<br/>
</p>
<p>
By nature trees do rot when they are grown.<br/>
And plums and apples thoroughly ripe do fall,<br/>
And corn and grass are in their season mown,<br/>
And time brings down what is both strong and tall.<br/>
But plants new set to be eradicate,<br/>
And buds new blown, to have so short a date,<br/>
Is by His hand alone that guides nature and fate.<br/>
</p>

<h1>In Reference to her Children, 23 June 1659</h1>
<h2>by Anne Bradstreet</h2>
<p>
I had eight birds hatcht in one nest,<br/>
Four Cocks were there, and Hens the rest.<br/>
I nurst them up with pain and care,<br/>
No cost nor labour did I spare<br/>
Till at the last they felt their wing,<br/>
Mounted the Trees and learned to sing.<br/>
Chief of the Brood then took his flight<br/>
To Regions far and left me quite.<br/>
My mournful chirps I after send<br/>
Till he return, or I do end.<br/>
Leave not thy nest, thy Dame and Sire,<br/>
Fly back and sing amidst this Quire.<br/>
My second bird did take her flight<br/>
And with her mate flew out of sight.<br/>
Southward they both their course did bend,<br/>
And Seasons twain they there did spend,<br/>
Till after blown by Southern gales<br/>
They Norward steer'd with filled sails.<br/>
A prettier bird was no where seen,<br/>
Along the Beach, among the treen.<br/>
I have a third of colour white<br/>
On whom I plac'd no small delight,<br/>
Coupled with mate loving and true,<br/>
Hath also bid her Dame adieu.<br/>
And where Aurora first appears,<br/>
She now hath percht to spend her years.<br/>
One to the Academy flew<br/>
To chat among that learned crew.<br/>
Ambition moves still in his breast<br/>
That he might chant above the rest,<br/>
Striving for more than to do well,<br/>
That nightingales he might excell.<br/>
My fifth, whose down is yet scarce gone,<br/>
Is ‘mongst the shrubs and bushes flown<br/>
And as his wings increase in strength<br/>
On higher boughs he'll perch at length.<br/>
My other three still with me nest<br/>
Until they're grown, then as the rest,<br/>
Or here or there, they'll take their flight,<br/>
As is ordain'd, so shall they light.<br/>
If birds could weep, then would my tears<br/>
Let others know what are my fears<br/>
Lest this my brood some harm should catch<br/>
And be surpris'd for want of watch<br/>
Whilst pecking corn and void of care<br/>
They fall un'wares in Fowler's snare;<br/>
Or whilst on trees they sit and sing<br/>
Some untoward boy at them do fling,<br/>
Or whilst allur'd with bell and glass<br/>
The net be spread and caught, alas;<br/>
Or lest by Lime-twigs they be foil'd;<br/>
Or by some greedy hawks be spoil'd.<br/>
O would, my young, ye saw my breast<br/>
And knew what thoughts there sadly rest.<br/>
Great was my pain when I you bred,<br/>
Great was my care when I you fed.<br/>
Long did I keep you soft and warm<br/>
And with my wings kept off all harm.<br/>
My cares are more, and fears, than ever,<br/>
My throbs such now as ‘fore were never.<br/>
Alas, my birds, you wisdom want<br/>
Of perils you are ignorant.<br/>
Oft times in grass, on trees, in flight,<br/>
Sore accidents on you may light.<br/>
O to your safety have an eye,<br/>
So happy may you live and die.<br/>
Mean while, my days in tunes I'll spend<br/>
Till my weak lays with me shall end.<br/>
In shady woods I'll sit and sing<br/>
And things that past, to mind I'll bring.<br/>
Once young and pleasant, as are you,<br/>
But former toys (no joys) adieu!<br/>
My age I will not once lament<br/>
But sing, my time so near is spent,<br/>
And from the top bough take my flight<br/>
Into a country beyond sight<br/>
Where old ones instantly grow young<br/>
And there with seraphims set song.<br/>
No seasons cold, nor storms they see<br/>
But spring lasts to eternity.<br/>
When each of you shall in your nest<br/>
Among your young ones take your rest,<br/>
In chirping languages oft them tell<br/>
You had a Dame that lov'd you well,<br/>
That did what could be done for young<br/>
And nurst you up till you were strong<br/>
And ‘fore she once would let you fly<br/>
She shew'd you joy and misery,<br/>
Taught what was good, and what was ill,<br/>
What would save life, and what would kill.<br/>
Thus gone, amongst you I may live,<br/>
And dead, yet speak and counsel give.<br/>
Farewell, my birds, farewell, adieu,<br/>
I happy am, if well with you.<br/>

<h1>To Her Father with Some Verses</h1>
<h2>by Anne Bradstreet</h2>
<p>
Most truly honoured, and as truly dear,<br/>
If worth in me or ought I do appear,<br/>
Who can of right better demand the same<br/>
Than may your worthy self from whom it came?<br/>
The principal might yield a greater sum,<br/>
Yet handled ill, amounts but to this crumb;<br/>
My stock's so small I know not how to pay,<br/>
My bond remains in force unto this day;<br/>
Yet for part payment take this simple mite,<br/>
Where nothing's to be had, kings loose their right.<br/>
Such is my debt I may not say forgive,<br/>
But as I can, I'll pay it while I live;<br/>
Such is my bond, none can discharge but I,<br/>
Yet paying is not paid until I die.<br/>

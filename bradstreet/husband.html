<h1>To My Dear and Loving Husband</h1>
<h2>by Anne Bradstreet</h2>
<p>
If ever two were one, then surely we.<br/>
If ever man were loved by wife, then thee.<br/>
If ever wife was happy in a man,<br/>
Compare with me, ye women, if you can.<br/>
I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,<br/>
Or all the riches that the East doth hold.<br/>
My love is such that rivers cannot quench,<br/>
Nor ought but love from thee give recompense.<br/>
Thy love is such I can no way repay;<br/>
The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.<br/>
Then while we live, in love let's so persever,<br/>
That when we live no more, we may live ever.<br/>

<h1>The Author to Her Book</h1>
<h2>by Anne Bradstreet</h2>
<p>
Thou ill-form'd offspring of my feeble brain,<br/>
Who after birth didst by my side remain,<br/>
Till snatched from thence by friends, less wise than true,<br/>
Who thee abroad, expos'd to publick view,<br/>
Made thee in raggs, halting to th' press to trudge,<br/>
Where errors were not lessened (all may judg).<br/>
At thy return my blushing was not small,<br/>
My rambling brat (in print) should mother call,<br/>
I cast thee by as one unfit for light,<br/>
Thy Visage was so irksome in my sight;<br/>
Yet being mine own, at length affection would<br/>
Thy blemishes amend, if so I could:<br/>
I wash'd thy face, but more defects I saw,<br/>
And rubbing off a spot, still made a flaw.<br/>
I stretched thy joynts to make thee even feet,<br/>
Yet still thou run'st more hobling then is meet;<br/>
In better dress to trim thee was my mind,<br/>
But nought save home-spun Cloth, i' th' house I find.<br/>
In this array 'mongst Vulgars mayst thou roam.<br/>
In Criticks hands, beware thou dost not come;<br/>
And take thy way where yet thou art not known,<br/>
If for thy Father askt, say, thou hadst none:<br/>
And for thy Mother, she alas is poor,<br/>
Which caus'd her thus to send thee out of door.<br/>

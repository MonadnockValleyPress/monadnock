<h1>As Weary Pilgrim, Now at Rest</h1>
<h2>by Anne Bradstreet</h2>
<p>
As weary pilgrim, now at rest,<br/>
Hugs with delight his silent nest<br/>
His wasted limbes, now lye full soft<br/>
That myrie steps, haue troden oft<br/>
Blesses himself, to think vpon<br/>
his dangers past, and travailes done<br/>
The burning sun no more shall heat<br/>
Nor stormy raines, on him shall beat.<br/>
The bryars and thornes no more shall scratch<br/>
nor hungry wolues at him shall catch<br/>
He erring pathes no more shall tread<br/>
nor wild fruits eate, in stead of bread,<br/>
for waters cold he doth not long<br/>
for thirst no more shall parch his tongue<br/>
No rugged stones his feet shall gaule<br/>
nor stumps nor rocks cause him to fall<br/>
All cares and feares, he bids farwell<br/>
and meanes in safity now to dwell.<br/>
A pilgrim I, on earth, perplext<br/>
wth sinns wth cares and sorrows vext<br/>
By age and paines brought to decay<br/>
and my Clay house mouldring away<br/>
Oh how I long to be at rest<br/>
and soare on high among the blest.<br/>
This body shall in silence sleep<br/>
Mine eyes no more shall ever weep<br/>
No fainting fits shall me assaile<br/>
nor grinding paines my body fraile<br/>
Wth cares and fears ne'r cumbred be<br/>
Nor losses know, nor sorrowes see<br/>
What tho my flesh shall there consume<br/>
it is the bed Christ did perfume<br/>
And when a few yeares shall be gone<br/>
this mortall shall be cloth'd vpon<br/>
A Corrupt Carcasse downe it lyes<br/>
a glorious body it shall rise<br/>
In weaknes and dishonour sowne<br/>
in power 'tis rais'd by Christ alone<br/>
Then soule and body shall vnite<br/>
and of their maker haue the sight<br/>
Such lasting ioyes shall there behold<br/>
as eare ne'r heard nor tongue e'er told<br/>
Lord make me ready for that day<br/>
then Come deare bridgrome Come away.<br/>

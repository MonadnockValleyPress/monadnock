<h1>Contemplations</h1>
<h2>by Anne Bradstreet</h2>
<h4>1</h4>
<p>
Sometime now past in the Autumnal Tide,<br/>
When Phoebus wanted but one hour to bed,<br/>
The trees all richly clad, yet void of pride,<br/>
Were gilded o're by his rich golden head.<br/>
Their leaves and fruits seem'd painted but was true<br/>
Of green, of red, of yellow, mixed hew,<br/>
Rapt were my senses at this delectable view.<br/>
</p>
<h4>2</h4>
<p>
I wist not what to wish, yet sure thought I,<br/>
If so much excellence abide below,<br/>
How excellent is he that dwells on high?<br/>
Whose power and beauty by his works we know.<br/>
Sure he is goodness, wisdom, glory, light,<br/>
That hath this under world so richly dight.<br/>
More Heaven than Earth was here, no winter and no night.<br/>
</p>
<h4>3</h4>
<p>
Then on a stately Oak I cast mine Eye,<br/>
Whose ruffling top the Clouds seem'd to aspire;<br/>
How long since thou wast in thine Infancy?<br/>
Thy strength and stature, more thy years admire,<br/>
Hath hundred winters past since thou wast born?<br/>
Or thousand since thou brakest thy shell of horn,<br/>
If so, all these as nought, Eternity doth scorn.<br/>
</p>
<h4>4</h4>
<p>
Then higher on the glistering Sun I gaz'd,<br/>
Whose beams was shaded by the leafy Tree.<br/>
The more I look'd, the more I grew amaz'd<br/>
And softly said, what glory's like to thee?<br/>
Soul of this world, this Universe's Eye,<br/>
No wonder some made thee a Deity:<br/>
Had I not better known (alas) the same had I.<br/>
</p>
<h4>5</h4>
<p>
Thou as a Bridegroom from thy Chamber rushes<br/>
And as a strong man joys to run a race.<br/>
The morn doth usher thee with smiles and blushes.<br/>
The Earth reflects her glances in thy face.<br/>
Birds, insects, Animals with Vegative,<br/>
Thy heat from death and dullness doth revive:<br/>
And in the darksome womb of fruitful nature dive.<br/>
</p>
<h4>6</h4>
<p>
Thy swift Annual and diurnal Course,<br/>
Thy daily straight and yearly oblique path,<br/>
Thy pleasing fervour, and thy scorching force,<br/>
All mortals here the feeling knowledge hath.<br/>
Thy presence makes it day, thy absence night,<br/>
Quaternal seasons caused by thy might:<br/>
Hail Creature, full of sweetness, beauty, and delight.<br/>
</p>
<h4>7</h4>
<p>
Art thou so full of glory that no Eye<br/>
Hath strength thy shining Rays once to behold?<br/>
And is thy splendid Throne erect so high?<br/>
As, to approach it, can no earthly mould.<br/>
How full of glory then must thy Creator be?<br/>
Who gave this bright light luster unto thee:<br/>
Admir'd, ador'd for ever be that Majesty.<br/>
</p>
<h4>8</h4>
<p>
Silent alone where none or saw, or heard,<br/>
In pathless paths I lead my wand'ring feet.<br/>
My humble Eyes to lofty Skies I rear'd<br/>
To sing some Song my mazed Muse thought meet.<br/>
My great Creator I would magnifie,<br/>
That nature had thus decked liberally:<br/>
But Ah and Ah again, my imbecility!<br/>
</p>
<h4>9</h4>
<p>
I heard the merry grasshopper then sing,<br/>
The black clad Cricket bear a second part.<br/>
They kept one tune and played on the same string,<br/>
Seeming to glory in their little Art.<br/>
Shall creatures abject thus their voices raise?<br/>
And in their kind resound their maker's praise:<br/>
Whilst I, as mute, can warble forth no higher layes.<br/>
</p>
<h4>10</h4>
<p>
When present times look back to Ages past<br/>
And men in being fancy those are dead,<br/>
It makes things gone perpetually to last<br/>
And calls back months and years that long since fled<br/>
It makes a man more aged in conceit,<br/>
Than was Methuselah or's grand-sire great:<br/>
While of their persons and their acts his mind doth treat.<br/>
</p>
<h4>11</h4>
<p>
Sometimes in Eden fair he seems to be,<br/>
See glorious Adam there made Lord of all,<br/>
Fancies the Apple, dangle on the Tree,<br/>
That turn'd his Sovereign to a naked thrall,<br/>
Who like a miscreant's driven from that place<br/>
To get his bread with pain and sweat of face:<br/>
A penalty impos'd on his backsliding Race.<br/>
</p>
<h4>12</h4>
<p>
Here sits our Grandame in retired place,<br/>
And in her lap her bloody Cain new born,<br/>
The weeping Imp oft looks her in the face,<br/>
Bewails his unknown hap and fate forlorn;<br/>
His Mother sighs to think of Paradise,<br/>
And how she lost her bliss, to be more wise,<br/>
Believing him that was, and is, Father of lyes.<br/>
</p>
<h4>13</h4>
<p>
Here Cain and Abel come to sacrifice,<br/>
Fruits of the Earth and Fatlings each do bring,<br/>
On Abels gift the fire descends from Skies,<br/>
But no such sign on false Cain's offering;<br/>
With sullen hateful looks he goes his wayes.<br/>
Hath thousand thoughts to end his brothers dayes,<br/>
Upon whose blood his future good he hopes to raise.<br/>
</p>
<h4>14</h4>
<p>
There Abel keeps his sheep, no ill he thinks,<br/>
His brother comes, then acts his fratricide.<br/>
The Virgin Earth of blood her first draught drinks,<br/>
But since that time she often hath been cloy'd;<br/>
The wretch with ghastly face and dreadful mind,<br/>
Thinks each he sees will serve him in his kind,<br/>
Though none on Earth but kindred near then could he find.<br/>
</p>
<h4>15</h4>
<p>
Who fancies not his looks now at the Barr,<br/>
His face like death, his heart with horror fraught,<br/>
Nor Male-factor ever felt like warr,<br/>
When deep despair with wish of life hath fought,<br/>
Branded with guilt, and crusht with treble woes,<br/>
A Vagabond to Land of Nod he goes.<br/>
A City builds, that wals might him secure from foes.<br/>
</p>
<h4>16</h4>
<p>
Who thinks not oft upon the Fathers ages.<br/>
Their long descent, how nephews sons they saw,<br/>
The starry observations of those Sages,<br/>
And how their precepts to their sons were law,<br/>
How Adam sigh'd to see his Progeny,<br/>
Cloath'd all in his black, sinful Livery,<br/>
Who neither guilt not yet the punishment could fly.<br/>
</p>
<h4>17</h4>
<p>
Our Life compare we with their length of dayes<br/>
Who to the tenth of theirs doth now arrive?<br/>
And though thus short, we shorten many wayes,<br/>
Living so little while we are alive;<br/>
In eating, drinking, sleeping, vain delight<br/>
So unawares comes on perpetual night,<br/>
And puts all pleasures vain unto eternal flight.<br/>
</p>
<h4>18</h4>
<p>
When I behold the heavens as in their prime,<br/>
And then the earth (though old) still clad in green,<br/>
The stones and trees, insensible of time,<br/>
Nor age nor wrinkle on their front are seen;<br/>
If winter come, and greenness then do fade,<br/>
A Spring returns, and they more youthfull made;<br/>
But Man grows old, lies down, remains where once he's laid.<br/>
</p>
<h4>19</h4>
<p>
By birth more noble than those creatures all,<br/>
Yet seems by nature and by custom curs'd,<br/>
No sooner born, but grief and care makes fall<br/>
That state obliterate he had at first:<br/>
Nor youth, nor strength, nor wisdom spring again<br/>
Nor habitations long their names retain,<br/>
But in oblivion to the final day remain.<br/>
</p>
<h4>20</h4>
<p>
Shall I then praise the heavens, the trees, the earth<br/>
Because their beauty and their strength last longer<br/>
Shall I wish there, or never to had birth,<br/>
Because they're bigger and their bodyes stronger?<br/>
Nay, they shall darken, perish, fade and dye,<br/>
And when unmade, so ever shall they lye,<br/>
But man was made for endless immortality.<br/>
</p>
<h4>21</h4>
<p>
Under the cooling shadow of a stately Elm<br/>
Close sate I by a goodly Rivers side,<br/>
Where gliding streams the Rocks did overwhelm;<br/>
A lonely place, with pleasures dignifi'd.<br/>
I once that lov'd the shady woods so well,<br/>
Now thought the rivers did the trees excel,<br/>
And if the sun would ever shine, there would I dwell.<br/>
</p>
<h4>22</h4>
<p>
While on the stealing stream I fixt mine eye,<br/>
Which to the long'd-for Ocean held its course,<br/>
I markt, nor crooks, nor rubs that there did lye<br/>
Could hinder ought but still augment its force:<br/>
O happy Flood, quoth I, that holds thy race<br/>
Till thou arrive at thy beloved place,<br/>
Nor is it rocks or shoals that can obstruct thy pace.<br/>
</p>
<h4>23</h4>
<p>
Nor is't enough that thou alone may'st slide,<br/>
But hundred brooks in thy cleer waves do meet,<br/>
So hand in hand along with thee they glide<br/>
To Thetis house, where all imbrace and greet:<br/>
Thou Emblem true of what I count the best,<br/>
O could I lead my Rivolets to rest,<br/>
So may we press to that vast mansion, ever blest.<br/>
</p>
<h4>24</h4>
<p>
Ye Fish which in this liquid Region 'bide<br/>
That for each season have your habitation,<br/>
Now salt, now fresh where you think best to glide<br/>
To unknown coasts to give a visitation,<br/>
In Lakes and ponds, you leave your numerous fry,<br/>
So Nature taught, and yet you know not why,<br/>
You watry folk that know not your felicity.<br/>
</p>
<h4>25</h4>
<p>
Look how the wantons frisk to tast the air,<br/>
Then to the colder bottome streight they dive,<br/>
Eftsoon to Neptun's glassy Hall repair<br/>
To see what trade they, great ones, there do drive,<br/>
Who forrage o're the spacious sea-green field,<br/>
And take the trembling prey before it yield,<br/>
Whose armour is their scales, their spreading fins their shield.<br/>
</p>
<h4>26</h4>
<p>
While musing thus with contemplation fed,<br/>
And thousand fancies buzzing in my brain,<br/>
The sweet-tongu'd Philomel percht ore my head,<br/>
And chanted forth a most melodious strain<br/>
Which rapt me so with wonder and delight,<br/>
I judg'd my hearing better than my sight,<br/>
And wisht me wings with her a while to take my flight.<br/>
</p>
<h4>27</h4>
<p>
O merry Bird (said I) that fears no snares,<br/>
That neither toyles nor hoards up in thy barn,<br/>
Feels no sad thoughts, nor cruciating cares<br/>
To gain more good, or shun what might thee harm<br/>
Thy clothes ne're wear, thy meat is every where,<br/>
Thy bed a bough, thy drink the water cleer,<br/>
Reminds not what is past, nor whats to come dost fear.<br/>
</p>
<h4>28</h4>
<p>
The dawning morn with songs thou dost prevent,<br/>
Sets hundred notes unto thy feathered crew,<br/>
So each one tunes his pretty instrument,<br/>
And warbling out the old, begin anew,<br/>
And thus they pass their youth in summer season,<br/>
Then follow thee into a better Region,<br/>
Where winter's never felt by that sweet airy legion.<br/>
</p>
<h4>29</h4>
<p>
Man at the best a creature frail and vain,<br/>
In knowledge ignorant, in strength but weak,<br/>
Subject to sorrows, losses, sickness, pain,<br/>
Each storm his state, his mind, his body break,<br/>
From some of these he never finds cessation,<br/>
But day or night, within, without, vexation,<br/>
Troubles from foes, from friends, from dearest, near'st Relation.<br/>
</p>
<h4>30</h4>
<p>
And yet this sinfull creature, frail and vain,<br/>
This lump of wretchedness, of sin and sorrow,<br/>
This weather-beaten vessel wrackt with pain,<br/>
Joys not in hope of an eternal morrow;<br/>
Nor all his losses, crosses and vexation,<br/>
In weight, in frequency and long duration<br/>
Can make him deeply groan for that divine Translation.<br/>
</p>
<h4>31</h4>
<p>
The Mariner that on smooth waves doth glide,<br/>
Sings merrily and steers his Barque with ease,<br/>
As if he had command of wind and tide,<br/>
And now becomes great Master of the seas;<br/>
But suddenly a storm spoils all the sport,<br/>
And makes him long for a more quiet port,<br/>
Which 'gainst all adverse winds may serve for fort.<br/>
</p>
<h4>32</h4>
<p>
So he that faileth in this world of pleasure,<br/>
Feeding on sweets, that never bit of th' sowre,<br/>
That's full of friends, of honour and of treasure,<br/>
Fond fool, he takes this earth ev'n for heav'ns bower,<br/>
But sad affliction comes and makes him see<br/>
Here's neither honour, wealth, nor safety;<br/>
Only above is found all with security.<br/>
</p>
<h4>33</h4>
<p>
O Time the fatal wrack of mortal things,<br/>
That draws oblivions curtains over kings,<br/>
Their sumptuous monuments, men know them not,<br/>
Their names without a Record are forgot,<br/>
Their parts, their ports, their pomp's all laid in th' dust.<br/>
Nor wit, nor gold, nor buildings scape times rust;<br/>
But he whose name is grav'd in the white stone<br/>
Shall last and shine when all of these are gone.<br/>

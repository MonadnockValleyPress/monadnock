<h1>To the memory of my dear Daughter in Law</h1>
<h2>by Anne Bradstreet</h2>
<p>
And live I still to see Relations gone,<br/>
And yet survive to sound this wailing tone;<br/>
Ah, woe is me, to write thy Funeral Song,<br/>
Who might in reason yet have lived long,<br/>
I saw the branches lopt the Tree now fall,<br/>
I stood so nigh, it crusht me down withal;<br/>
My bruised heart lies sobbing at the Root,<br/>
That thou dear Son hath lost both Tree and fruit:<br/>
Thou then on Seas sailing to forreign Coast;<br/>
Was ignorant what riches thou hadst lost.<br/>
But ah too soon those heavy tydings fly,<br/>
To strike thee with amazing misery;<br/>
Oh how I simpathize with thy sad heart,<br/>
And in thy griefs still bear a second part:<br/>
I lost a daughter dear, but thou a wife,<br/>
Who lov'd thee more (it seem'd) then her own life.<br/>
Thou being gone, she longer could not be,<br/>
Because her Soul she'd sent along with thee.<br/>
One week she only past in pain and woe,<br/>
And then her sorrows all at once did go;<br/>
A Babe she left before, she soar'd above,<br/>
The fifth and last pledg of her dying love,<br/>
E're nature would, it hither did arrive,<br/>
No wonder it no longer did survive.<br/>
So with her Children four, she's now a rest,<br/>
All freed from grief (I trust) among the blest;<br/>
She one hath left, a joy to thee and me,<br/>
The Heavens vouchsafe she may so ever be.<br/>
Chear up, (dear Son) thy fainting bleeding heart,<br/>
In him alone, that caused all this smart;<br/>
What though thy strokes full sad & grievous be,<br/>
He knows it is the best for thee and me.<br/>

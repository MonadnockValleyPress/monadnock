<h1>A Letter to her Husband, absent upon Publick employment</h1>
<h2>by Anne Bradstreet</h2>
<p>
My head, my heart, mine Eyes, my life, nay more,<br/>
My joy, my Magazine of earthly store,<br/>
If two be one, as surely thou and I,<br/>
How stayest thou there, whilst I at Ipswich lye?<br/>
So many steps, head from the heart to sever<br/>
If but a neck, soon should we be together:<br/>
I like the earth this season, mourn in black,<br/>
My Sun is gone so far in's Zodiack,<br/>
Whom whilst I 'joy'd, nor storms, nor frosts I felt,<br/>
His warmth such frigid colds did cause to melt.<br/>
My chilled limbs now nummed lye forlorn;<br/>
Return, return sweet Sol from Capricorn;<br/>
In this dead time, alas, what can I more<br/>
Then view those fruits which through thy heat I bore?<br/>
Which sweet contentment yield me for a space,<br/>
True living Pictures of their Fathers face.<br/>
O strange effect! now thou art Southward gone,<br/>
I weary grow, the tedious day so long;<br/>
But when thou Northward to me shalt return,<br/>
I wish my Sun may never set, but burn<br/>
Within the Cancer of my glowing breast,<br/>
The welcome house of him my dearest guest.<br/>
Where ever, ever stay, and go not thence,<br/>
Till natures sad decree shall call thee hence;<br/>
Flesh of thy flesh, bone of thy bone,<br/>
I here, thou there, yet both but one.<br/>

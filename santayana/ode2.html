<h1>Ode #2</h1>
<h2>by George Santayana (1922)</h2>
<p>
My heart rebels against my generation,<br/>
That talks of freedom and is slave to riches,<br/>
And, toiling 'neath each day's ignoble burden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boasts of the morrow.
</p>
<p>
No space for noonday rest or midnight watches,<br/>
No purest joy of breathing under heaven!<br/>
Wretched themselves, they heap, to make them happy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many possessions.
</p>
<p>
But thou, O silent Mother, wise, immortal,<br/>
To whom our toil is laughter,&mdash;take, divine one,<br/>
This vanity away, and to thy lover<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give what is needful:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
A staunch heart, nobly calm, averse to evil,<br/>
The windy sky for breath, the sea, the mountain,<br/>
A well-born, gentle friend, his spirit's brother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever beside him.
</p>
<p>
What would you gain, ye seekers, with your striving,<br/>
Or what vast Babel raise you on your shoulders?<br/>
You multiply distresses, and your children<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely will curse you.
</p>
<p>
O leave them rather friendlier gods, and fairer<br/>
Orchards and temples, and a freer bosom!<br/>
What better comfort have we, or what other<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Profit in living,
</p>
<p>
Than to feed, sobered by the truth of Nature,<br/>
Awhile upon her bounty and her beauty,<br/>
And hand her torch of gladness to the ages<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following after?
</p>
<p>
She hath not made us, like her other children,<br/>
Merely for peopling of her spacious kingdoms,<br/>
Beasts of the wild, or insects of the summer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breeding and dying,
</p>
<p>
But also that we might, half knowing, worship<br/>
The deathless beauty of her guiding vision,<br/>
And learn to love, in all things mortal, only<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is eternal.

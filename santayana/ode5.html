<h1>Ode #5</h1>
<h2>by George Santayana (1922)</h2>
<p>
Of thee the Northman by his beached galley<br/>
Dreamt, as he watched the never-setting Ursa<br/>
And longed for summer and thy light, O sacred<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mediterranean.
</p>
<p>
Unseen he loved thee; for the heart within him<br/>
Knew earth had gardens where he might be blessed,<br/>
Putting away long dreams and aimless, barbarous<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunger for battle.
</p>
<p>
The foretaste of thy languors thawed his bosom;<br/>
A great need drove him to thy caverned islands<br/>
From the gray, endless reaches of the outer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desert of ocean.
</p>
<p>
He saw thy pillars, saw thy sudden mountains<br/>
Wrinkled and stark, and in their crooked gorges,<br/>
'Neath peeping pine and cypress, guessed the torrent<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smothered in flowers.
</p>
<p>
Thine incense to the sun, thy gathered vapours,<br/>
He saw suspended on the flanks of Taurus,<br/>
Or veiling the snowed bosom of the virgin<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister of Atlas.
</p>
<p>
He saw the luminous top of wide Olympus,<br/>
Fit for the happy gods; he saw the pilgrim<br/>
River, with rains of Ethiopia flooding<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Populous Egypt.
</p>
<p>
And having seen, he loved thee. His racked spirit,<br/>
By thy breath tempered and the light that clothes thee,<br/>
Forgot the monstrous gods, and made of Nature<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mistress and mother.
</p>
<p>
The more should I, O fatal sea, before thee<br/>
Of alien words make echoes to thy music;<br/>
For I was born where first the rills of Tagus<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn to the westward,
</p>
<p>
And wandering long, alas! have need of drinking<br/>
Deep of the patience of thy perfect sadness,<br/>
O thou that constant through the change of ages,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful ever,
</p>
<p>
Never wast wholly young and void of sorrows,<br/>
Nor ever canst be old, while yet the morning<br/>
Kindles thy ripples, or the golden evening<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyes thee in purple.
</p>
<p>
Thee, willing to be tamed but still untamable,<br/>
The Roman called his own until he perished,<br/>
As now the busy English hover o'er thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stalwart and noble;
</p>
<p>
But all is naught to thee, while no harsh winter<br/>
Congeals thy fountains, and the blown Sahara<br/>
Chokes not with dreadful sand thy deep and placid<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock-guarded havens.
</p>
<p>
Thou carest not what men may tread thy margin;<br/>
Nor I, while from some heather-scented headland<br/>
I may behold thy beauty, the eternal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solace of mortals.

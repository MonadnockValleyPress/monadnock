<h1>Ode #3</h1>
<h2>by George Santayana (1922)</h2>
<p>
Gathering the echoes of forgotten wisdom,<br/>
And mastered by a proud, adventurous purpose,<br/>
Columbus sought the golden shores of India<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opposite Europe.
</p>
<p>
He gave the world another world, and ruin<br/>
Brought upon blameless, river-loving nations,<br/>
Cursed Spain with barren gold, and made the Andes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiefs of Saint Peter;
</p>
<p>
While in the cheerless North the thrifty Saxon<br/>
Planted his corn, and, narrowing his bosom,<br/>
Made covenant with God, and by keen virtue<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trebled his riches.
</p>
<p>
What venture hast thou left us, bold Columbus?<br/>
What honour left thy brothers, brave Magellan?<br/>
Daily the children of the rich for pastime<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circle the planet.
</p>
<p>
And what good comes to us of all your dangers?<br/>
A smaller earth and smaller hope of heaven.<br/>
Ye have but cheapened gold, and, measuring ocean,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counted the islands.
</p>
<p>
No Ponce de Leon shall drink in fountains,<br/>
On any flowering Easter, youth eternal;<br/>
No Cortes look upon another ocean;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Alexander
</p>
<p>
Found in the Orient dim a boundless kingdom,<br/>
And, clothing his Greek strength in barbarous splendour,<br/>
Build by the sea his throne, while sacred Egypt<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honours his godhead.
</p>
<p>
The earth, the mother once of godlike Theseus<br/>
And mighty Heracles, at length is weary,<br/>
And now brings forth a spawn of antlike creatures,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blackening her valleys,
</p>
<p>
Inglorious in their birth and in their living,<br/>
Curious and querulous, afraid of battle,<br/>
Rummaging earth for coals, in camps of hovels<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crouching from winter,
</p>
<p>
As if grim fate, amid our boastful prating,<br/>
Made us the image of our brutish fathers,<br/>
When from their caves they issued, crazed with terror,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howling and hungry.
</p>
<p>
For all things come about in sacred cycles,<br/>
And life brings death, and light eternal darkness,<br/>
And now the world grows old apace; its glory<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passes for ever.
</p>
<p>
Perchance the earth will yet for many ages<br/>
Bear her dead child, her moon, around her orbit;<br/>
Strange craft may tempt the ocean streams, new forests<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cover the mountains.
</p>
<p>
If in those latter days men still remember<br/>
Our wisdom and our travail and our sorrow,<br/>
They never can be happy, with that burden<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy upon them,
</p>
<p>
Knowing the hideous past, the blood, the famine,<br/>
The ancestral hate, the eager faith's disaster,<br/>
All ending in their little lives, and vulgar<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circle of troubles.
</p>
<p>
But if they have forgot us, and the shifting<br/>
Of sands has buried deep our thousand cities,<br/>
Fell superstition then will seize upon them;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protean error
</p>
<p>
Will fill their panting heart with sickly phantoms<br/>
Of sudden blinding good and monstrous evil;<br/>
There will be miracles again, and torment,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dungeon, and fagot,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Until the patient earth, made dry and barren,<br/>
Sheds all her herbage in a final winter,<br/>
And the gods turn their eyes to some far distant<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright constellation.

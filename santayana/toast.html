<h1>A Toast</h1>
<h2>by George Santayana (1922)</h2>
<p>
See this bowl of purple wine,<br />
Life-blood of the lusty vine!<br />
All the warmth of summer suns<br />
In the vintage liquid runs,<br />
All the glow of winter nights<br />
Plays about its jewel lights,<br />
Thoughts of time when love was young<br />
Lurk its ruby drops among,<br />
And its deepest depths are dyed<br />
With delight of friendship tried.<br />
Worthy offering, I ween,<br />
For a god or for a queen,<br />
Is the draught I pour to thee,&mdash;<br />
Comfort of all misery,<br />
Single friend of the forlorn,<br />
Haven of all beings born,<br />
Hope when trouble wakes at night,<br />
And when naught delights, delight.<br />
Holy Death, I drink to thee;<br />
Do not part my friends and me.<br />
Take this gift, which for a night<br />
Puts dull leaden care to flight,<br />
Thou who takest grief away<br />
For a night and for a day.

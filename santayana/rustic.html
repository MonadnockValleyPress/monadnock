<h1>The Rustic at the Play</h1>
<h2>by George Santayana (1922)</h2>
<p>
Our youth is like a rustic at the play<br/>
That cries aloud in simple-hearted fear,<br/>
Curses the villain, shudders at the fray,<br/>
And weeps before the maiden's wreath√®d bier.<br/>
Yet once familiar with the changeful show,<br/>
He starts no longer at a brandished knife,<br/>
But, his heart chastened at the sight of woe,<br/>
Ponders the mirrored sorrows of his life.<br/>
So tutored too, I watch the moving art<br/>
Of all this magic and impassioned pain<br/>
That tells the story of the human heart<br/>
In a false instance, such as poets feign;<br/>
I smile, and keep within the parchment furled<br/>
That prompts the passions of this strutting world.

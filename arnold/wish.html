<h1>A Wish</h1>
<h2>by Matthew Arnold</h2>
<p>
I ask not that my bed of death<br/>
From bands of greedy heirs be free;<br/>
For these besiege the latest breath<br/>
Of fortune's favored sons, not me.
</p>
<p>
I ask not each kind soul to keep<br/>
Tearless, when of my death he hears.<br/>
Let those who will, if any, weep!<br/>
There are worse plagues on earth than tears.
</p>
<p>
I ask but that my death may find<br/>
The freedom to my life denied;<br/>
Ask but the folly of mankind<br/>
Then, then at last, to quit my side.
</p>
<p>
Spare me the whispering, crowded room,<br/>
The friends who come, and gape, and go;<br/>
The ceremonious air of gloom,&mdash;<br/>
All which makes death a hideous show!
</p>
<p>
Nor bring, to see me cease to live,<br/>
Some doctor full of phrase and fame,<br/>
To shake his sapient head, and give<br/>
The ill he cannot cure a name.
</p>
<p>
Nor fetch, to take the accustomed toll<br/>
Of the poor sinner bound for death,<br/>
His brother-doctor of the soul,<br/>
To canvass with official breath
</p>
<p>
The future and its viewless things,&mdash;<br/>
That undiscovered mystery<br/>
Which one who feels death's winnowing wings<br/>
Must needs read clearer, sure, than he!
</p>
<p>
Bring none of these; but let me be,<br/>
While all around in silence lies,<br/>
Moved to the window near, and see<br/>
Once more, before my dying eyes,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Bathed in the sacred dews of morn<br/>
The wide aÃ«rial landscape spread,&mdash;<br/>
The world which was ere I was born,<br/>
The world which lasts when I am dead;
</p>
<p>
Which never was the friend of one,<br/>
Nor promised love it could not give,<br/>
But lit for all its generous sun,<br/>
And lived itself, and made us live.
</p>
<p>
There let me gaze, till I become<br/>
In soul, with what I gaze on, wed!<br/>
To feel the universe my home;<br/>
To have before my mind&mdash;instead
</p>
<p>
Of the sick-room, the mortal strife,<br/>
The turmoil for a little breath&mdash;<br/>
The pure eternal course of life,<br/>
Not human combatings with death!
</p>
<p>
Thus feeling, gazing, might I grow<br/>
Composed, refreshed, ennobled, clear;<br/>
Then willing let my spirit go<br/>
To work or wait elsewhere or here!

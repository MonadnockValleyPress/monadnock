<h1>Memorial Verses</h1>
<h2>by Matthew Arnold</h2>
<p>(April, 1850.)</p>
<p>
Goethe in Weimar sleeps; and Greece,<br/>
Long since, saw Byron's struggle cease.<br/>
But one such death remained to come:<br/>
The last poetic voice is dumb,&mdash;<br/>
We stand to-day by Wordsworth's tomb.
</p>
<p>
When Byron's eyes were shut in death,<br/>
We bowed our head, and held our breath.<br/>
He taught us little, but our soul<br/>
Had felt him like the thunder's roll.<br/>
With shivering heart the strife we saw<br/>
Of passion with eternal law;<br/>
And yet with reverential awe<br/>
We watched the fount of fiery life<br/>
Which served for that Titanic strife.
</p>
<p>
When Goethe's death was told, we said,&mdash;<br/>
Sunk, then, is Europe's sagest head.<br/>
Physician of the iron age,<br/>
Goethe has done his pilgrimage.<br/>
He took the suffering human race,<br/>
He read each wound, each weakness clear;<br/>
And struck his finger on the place,<br/>
And said, <em>Thou ailest here, and here!</em><br/>
He looked on Europe's dying hour<br/>
Of fitful dream and feverish power;<br/>
His eye plunged down the weltering strife,<br/>
The turmoil of expiring life:<br/>
He said, <em>The end is everywhere,<br/>
Art still has truth, take refuge there!</em><br/>
And he was happy, if to know<br/>
Causes of things, and far below<br/>
His feet to see the lurid flow<br/>
Of terror, and insane distress,<br/>
And headlong fate, be happiness.
</p>
<p>
And Wordsworth! Ah, pale ghosts, rejoice!<br/>
For never has such soothing voice<br/>
Been to your shadowy world conveyed,<br/>
Since erst, at morn, some wandering shade<br/>
Heard the clear song of Orpheus come<br/>
Through Hades and the mournful gloom.<br/>
Wordsworth has gone from us; and ye,<br/>
Ah, may ye feel his voice as we!<br/>
He too upon a wintry clime<br/>
Had fallen,&mdash;on this iron time<br/>
Of doubts, disputes, distractions, fears.<br/>
He found us when the age had bound<br/>
Our souls in its benumbing round;<br/>
He spoke, and loosed our heart in tears.<br/>
He laid us as we lay at birth<br/>
On the cool flowery lap of earth:<br/>
Smiles broke from us, and we had ease;<br/>
The hills were round us, and the breeze<br/>
Went o'er the sunlit fields again;<br/>
Our foreheads felt the wind and rain.<br/>
Our youth returned; for there was shed<br/>
On spirits that had long been dead,<br/>
Spirits dried up and closely furled,<br/>
The freshness of the early world.
</p>
<p>
Ah! since dark days still bring to light<br/>
Man's prudence and man's fiery might,<br/>
Time may restore us in his course<br/>
Goethe's sage mind and Byron's force;<br/>
But where will Europe's latter hour<br/>
Again find Wordsworth's healing power?<br/>
Others will teach us how to dare,<br/>
And against fear our breast to steel:<br/>
Others will strengthen us to bear&mdash;<br/>
But who, ah! who will make us feel?<br/>
The cloud of mortal destiny,<br/>
Others will front it fearlessly;<br/>
But who, like him, will put it by?<br/>
Keep fresh the grass upon his grave,<br/>
O Rotha, with thy living wave!<br/>
Sing him thy best! for few or none<br/>
Hear thy voice right, now he is gone.

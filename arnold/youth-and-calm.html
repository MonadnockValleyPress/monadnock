<h1>Youth and Calm</h1>
<h2>by Matthew Arnold</h2>
<p>
'Tis death! and peace indeed is here,<br/>
And ease from shame, and rest from fear.<br/>
There's nothing can dismarble now<br/>
The smoothness of that limpid brow.<br/>
But is a calm like this, in truth,<br/>
The crowning end of life and youth?<br/>
And when this boon rewards the dead,<br/>
Are all debts paid, has all been said?<br/>
And is the heart of youth so light,<br/>
Its step so firm, its eye so bright,<br/>
Because on its hot brow there blows<br/>
A wind of promise and repose<br/>
From the far grave, to which it goes;<br/>
Because it has the hope to come,<br/>
One day, to harbor in the tomb?<br/>
Ah, no! the bliss youth dreams is one<br/>
For daylight, for the cheerful sun,<br/>
For feeling nerves and living breath;<br/>
Youth dreams a bliss on this side death.<br/>
It dreams a rest, if not more deep,<br/>
More grateful than this marble sleep;<br/>
It hears a voice within it tell,&mdash;<br/>
<em>Calm's not life's crown, though calm is well.</em><br/>
<em>'Tis all, perhaps, which man acquires,</em><br/>
<em>But 'tis not what our youth desires.</em><br/>

<h1>Worldly Place</h1>
<h2>by Matthew Arnold</h2>
<p>
<em>Even in a palace, life may be led well!</em><br/>
So spake the imperial sage, purest of men,<br/>
Marcus Aurelius. But the stifling den<br/>
Of common life, where, crowded up pell-mell,
</p>
<p>
Our freedom for a little bread we sell,<br/>
And drudge under some foolish master's ken<br/>
Who rates us if we peer outside our pen,&mdash;<br/>
Matched with a palace, is not this a hell?
</p>
<p>
<em>Even in a palace!</em> On his truth sincere,<br/>
Who spoke these words, no shadow ever came;<br/>
And when my ill-schooled spirit is aflame
</p>
<p>
Some nobler, ampler stage of life to win,<br/>
I'll stop, and say, "There were no succor here!<br/>
The aids to noble life are all within."
</p>

<h1>Rugby Chapel</h1>
<h2>by Matthew Arnold</h2>
<p>(November, 1857.)</p>
<p>
Coldly, sadly descends<br/>
The autumn evening. The field<br/>
Strewn with its dank yellow drifts<br/>
Of withered leaves, and the elms,<br/>
Fade into dimness apace,<br/>
Silent; hardly a shout<br/>
From a few boys late at their play!<br/>
The lights come out in the street,<br/>
In the schoolroom windows; but cold,<br/>
Solemn, unlighted, austere,<br/>
Through the gathering darkness, arise<br/>
The chapel-walls, in whose bound<br/>
Thou, my father! art laid.
</p>
<p>
There thou dost lie, in the gloom<br/>
Of the autumn evening. But ah!<br/>
That word <em>gloom</em> to my mind<br/>
Brings thee back in the light<br/>
Of thy radiant vigor again.<br/>
In the gloom of November we passed<br/>
Days not dark at thy side;<br/>
Seasons impaired not the ray<br/>
Of thy buoyant cheerfulness clear.<br/>
Such thou wast! and I stand<br/>
In the autumn evening, and think<br/>
Of bygone autumns with thee.
</p>
<p>
Fifteen years have gone round<br/>
Since thou arosest to tread,<br/>
In the summer-morning, the road<br/>
Of death, at a call unforeseen,<br/>
Sudden. For fifteen years,<br/>
We who till then in thy shade<br/>
Rested as under the boughs<br/>
Of a mighty oak, have endured<br/>
Sunshine and rain as we might,<br/>
Bare, unshaded, alone,<br/>
Lacking the shelter of thee.
</p>
<p>
O strong soul, by what shore<br/>
Tarriest thou now? For that force,<br/>
Surely, has not been left vain!<br/>
Somewhere, surely, afar,<br/>
In the sounding labor-house vast<br/>
Of being, is practised that strength,<br/>
Zealous, beneficent, firm!
</p>
<p>
Yes, in some far-shining sphere,<br/>
Conscious or not of the past,<br/>
Still thou performest the word<br/>
Of the Spirit in whom thou dost live,<br/>
Prompt, unwearied, as here.<br/>
Still thou upraisest with zeal<br/>
The humble good from the ground,<br/>
Sternly repressest the bad;<br/>
Still, like a trumpet, dost rouse<br/>
Those who with half-open eyes<br/>
Tread the border-land dim<br/>
'Twixt vice and virtue; reviv'st,<br/>
Succorest. This was thy work,<br/>
This was thy life upon earth.
</p>
<p>
What is the course of the life<br/>
Of mortal men on the earth?<br/>
Most men eddy about<br/>
Here and there, eat and drink,<br/>
Chatter and love and hate,<br/>
Gather and squander, are raised<br/>
Aloft, are hurled in the dust,<br/>
Striving blindly, achieving<br/>
Nothing; and then they die,&mdash;<br/>
Perish; and no one asks<br/>
Who or what they have been,<br/>
More than he asks what waves,<br/>
In the moonlit solitudes mild<br/>
Of the midmost ocean, have swelled,<br/>
Foamed for a moment, and gone.
</p>
<p>
And there are some whom a thirst<br/>
Ardent, unquenchable, fires,<br/>
Not with the crowd to be spent,<br/>
Not without aim to go round<br/>
In an eddy of purposeless dust,<br/>
Effort unmeaning and vain.<br/>
Ah yes! some of us strive<br/>
Not without action to die<br/>
Fruitless, but something to snatch<br/>
From dull oblivion, nor all<br/>
Glut the devouring grave.<br/>
We, we have chosen our path,&mdash;<br/>
Path to a clear-purposed goal,<br/>
Path of advance; but it leads<br/>
A long, steep journey, through sunk<br/>
Gorges, o'er mountains in snow.<br/>
Cheerful, with friends, we set forth:<br/>
Then, on the height, comes the storm.<br/>
Thunder crashes from rock<br/>
To rock; the cataracts reply;<br/>
Lightnings dazzle our eyes;<br/>
Roaring torrents have breached<br/>
The track; the stream-bed descends<br/>
In the place where the wayfarer once<br/>
Planted his footstep; the spray<br/>
Boils o'er its borders; aloft,<br/>
The unseen snow-beds dislodge<br/>
Their hanging ruin. Alas!<br/>
Havoc is made in our train!<br/>
Friends who set forth at our side<br/>
Falter, are lost in the storm.
</p>
<p>
We, we only are left!<br/>
With frowning foreheads, with lips<br/>
Sternly compressed, we strain on,<br/>
On; and at nightfall at last<br/>
Come to the end of our way,<br/>
To the lonely inn 'mid the rocks;<br/>
Where the gaunt and taciturn host<br/>
Stands on the threshold, the wind<br/>
Shaking his thin white hairs,<br/>
Holds his lantern to scan<br/>
Our storm-beat figures, and asks,&mdash;<br/>
Whom in our party we bring?<br/>
Whom we have left in the snow?
</p>
<p>
Sadly we answer, We bring<br/>
Only ourselves! we lost<br/>
Sight of the rest in the storm.<br/>
Hardly ourselves we fought through,<br/>
Stripped, without friends, as we are.<br/>
Friends, companions, and train,<br/>
The avalanche swept from our side.
</p>
<p>
But thou wouldst not <em>alone</em><br/>
Be saved, my father! <em>alone</em><br/>
Conquer and come to thy goal,<br/>
Leaving the rest in the wild.<br/>
We were weary, and we<br/>
Fearful, and we in our march<br/>
Fain to drop down and to die.<br/>
Still thou turnedst, and still<br/>
Beckonedst the trembler, and still<br/>
Gavest the weary thy hand.<br/>
If, in the paths of the world,<br/>
Stones might have wounded thy feet,<br/>
Toil or dejection have tried<br/>
Thy spirit, of that we saw<br/>
Nothing: to us thou wast still<br/>
Cheerful, and helpful, and firm!<br/>
Therefore to thee it was given<br/>
Many to save with thyself;<br/>
And, at the end of thy day,<br/>
O faithful shepherd! to come,<br/>
Bringing thy sheep in thy hand.
</p>
<p>
And through thee I believe<br/>
In the noble and great who are gone;<br/>
Pure souls honored and blest<br/>
By former ages, who else&mdash;<br/>
Such, so soulless, so poor,<br/>
Is the race of men whom I see&mdash;<br/>
Seemed but a dream of the heart,<br/>
Seemed but a cry of desire.<br/>
Yes! I believe that there lived<br/>
Others like thee in the past,<br/>
Not like the men of the crowd<br/>
Who all round me to-day<br/>
Bluster or cringe, and make life<br/>
Hideous and arid and vile;<br/>
But souls tempered with fire,<br/>
Fervent, heroic, and good,<br/>
Helpers and friends of mankind.
</p>
<p>
Servants of God!&mdash;or sons<br/>
Shall I not call you? because<br/>
Not as servants ye knew<br/>
Your Father's innermost mind,<br/>
His who unwillingly sees<br/>
One of his little ones lost,&mdash;<br/>
Yours is the praise, if mankind<br/>
Hath not as yet in its march<br/>
Fainted and fallen and died.
</p>
<p>
See! In the rocks of the world<br/>
Marches the host of mankind,<br/>
A feeble, wavering line.<br/>
Where are they tending? A God<br/>
Marshalled them, gave them their goal.<br/>
Ah, but the way is so long!
</p>
<p>
Years they have been in the wild:<br/>
Sore thirst plagues them; the rocks,<br/>
Rising all round, overawe;<br/>
Factions divide them; their host<br/>
Threatens to break, to dissolve.<br/>
Ah! keep, keep them combined!<br/>
Else, of the myriads who fill<br/>
That army, not one shall arrive;<br/>
Sole they shall stray; on the rocks<br/>
Batter forever in vain,<br/>
Die one by one in the waste.
</p>
<p>
Then, in such hour of need<br/>
Of your fainting, dispirited race,<br/>
Ye like angels appear,<br/>
Radiant with ardor divine.<br/>
Beacons of hope, ye appear!<br/>
Languor is not in your heart,<br/>
Weakness is not in your word,<br/>
Weariness not on your brow.<br/>
Ye alight in our van! at your voice,<br/>
Panic, despair, flee away.<br/>
Ye move through the ranks, recall<br/>
The stragglers, refresh the outworn,<br/>
Praise, re-inspire the brave.<br/>
Order, courage, return;<br/>
Eyes rekindling, and prayers,<br/>
Follow your steps as ye go.<br/>
Ye fill up the gaps in our files,<br/>
Strengthen the wavering line,<br/>
Stablish, continue our march,<br/>
On, to the bound of the waste,<br/>
On, to the City of God.

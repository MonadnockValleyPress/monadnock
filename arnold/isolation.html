<h1>Isolation. To Marguerite</h1>
<h2>by Matthew Arnold</h2>
<p>
We were apart: yet, day by day,<br/>
I bade my heart more constant be.<br/>
I bade it keep the world away,<br/>
And grow a home for only thee;<br/>
Nor feared but thy love likewise grew,<br/>
Like mine, each day, more tried, more true.
</p>
<p>
The fault was grave! I might have known,<br/>
What far too soon, alas! I learned,&mdash;<br/>
The heart can bind itself alone,<br/>
And faith may oft be unreturned.<br/>
Self-swayed our feelings ebb and swell.<br/>
Thou lov'st no more. Farewell! Farewell!
</p>
<p>
Farewell!&mdash;And thou, thou lonely heart,<br/>
Which never yet without remorse<br/>
Even for a moment didst depart<br/>
From thy remote and spher√®d course<br/>
To haunt the place where passions reign,&mdash;<br/>
Back to thy solitude again!
</p>
<p>
Back! with the conscious thrill of shame<br/>
Which Luna felt, that summer-night,<br/>
Flash through her pure immortal frame,<br/>
When she forsook the starry height<br/>
To hang o'er Endymion's sleep<br/>
Upon the pine-grown Latmian steep.
</p>
<p>
Yet she, chaste queen, had never proved<br/>
How vain a thing is mortal love,<br/>
Wandering in heaven, far removed;<br/>
But thou hast long had place to prove<br/>
This truth,&mdash;to prove, and make thine own:<br/>
"Thou hast been, shalt be, art, alone."
</p>
<p>
Or, if not quite alone, yet they<br/>
Which touch thee are unmating things,&mdash;<br/>
Ocean and clouds and night and day;<br/>
Lorn autumns and triumphant springs;<br/>
And life, and others' joy and pain,<br/>
And love, if love, of happier men.
</p>
<p>
Of happier men; for they, at least,<br/>
Have dreamed two human hearts might blend<br/>
In one, and were through faith released<br/>
From isolation without end<br/>
Prolonged; nor knew, although not less<br/>
Alone than thou, their loneliness.

<h1>Sohrab and Rustum</h1>
<h2>by Matthew Arnold</h2>
<p>
And the first grey of morning fill'd the east,<br/>
And the fog rose out of the Oxus stream.<br/>
But all the Tartar camp along the stream<br/>
Was hush'd, and still the men were plunged in sleep;<br/>
Sohrab alone, he slept not; all night long<br/>
He had lain wakeful, tossing on his bed;<br/>
But when the grey dawn stole into his tent,<br/>
He rose, and clad himself, and girt his sword,<br/>
And took his horseman's cloak, and left his tent,<br/>
And went abroad into the cold wet fog,<br/>
Through the dim camp to Peran-Wisa's tent.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Through the black Tartar tents he pass'd, which stood<br/>
Clustering like bee-hives on the low flat strand<br/>
Of Oxus, where the summer-floods o'erflow<br/>
When the sun melts the snows in high Pamere<br/>
Through the black tents he pass'd, o'er that low strand,<br/>
And to a hillock came, a little back<br/>
From the stream's brink&mdash;the spot where first a boat,<br/>
Crossing the stream in summer, scrapes the land.<br/>
The men of former times had crown'd the top<br/>
With a clay fort; but that was fall'n, and now<br/>
The Tartars built there Peran-Wisa's tent,<br/>
A dome of laths, and o'er it felts were spread.<br/>
And Sohrab came there, and went in, and stood<br/>
Upon the thick piled carpets in the tent,<br/>
And found the old man sleeping on his bed<br/>
Of rugs and felts, and near him lay his arms.<br/>
And Peran-Wisa heard him, though the step<br/>
Was dull'd; for he slept light, an old man's sleep;<br/>
And he rose quickly on one arm, and said:&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Who art thou? for it is not yet clear dawn.<br/>
Speak! is there news, or any night alarm?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
But Sohrab came to the bedside, and said:&mdash;<br/>
"Thou know'st me, Peran-Wisa! it is I.<br/>
The sun is not yet risen, and the foe<br/>
Sleep; but I sleep not; all night long I lie<br/>
Tossing and wakeful, and I come to thee.<br/>
For so did King Afrasiab bid me seek<br/>
Thy counsel, and to heed thee as thy son,<br/>
In Samarcand, before the army march'd;<br/>
And I will tell thee what my heart desires.<br/>
Thou know'st if, since from Ader-baijan first<br/>
I came among the Tartars and bore arms,<br/>
I have still served Afrasiab well, and shown,<br/>
At my boy's years, the courage of a man.<br/>
This too thou know'st, that while I still bear on<br/>
The conquering Tartar ensigns through the world,<br/>
And beat the Persians back on every field,<br/>
I seek one man, one man, and one alone&mdash;<br/>
Rustum, my father; who I hoped should greet,<br/>
Should one day greet, upon some well-fought field,<br/>
His not unworthy, not inglorious son.<br/>
So I long hoped, but him I never find.<br/>
Come then, hear now, and grant me what I ask.<br/>
Let the two armies rest to-day; but I<br/>
Will challenge forth the bravest Persian lords<br/>
To meet me, man to man; if I prevail,<br/>
Rustum will surely hear it; if I fall&mdash;<br/>
Old man, the dead need no one, claim no kin.<br/>
Dim is the rumour of a common fight,<br/>
Where host meets host, and many names are sunk;<br/>
But of a single combat fame speaks clear."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke; and Peran-Wisa took the hand<br/>
Of the young man in his, and sigh'd, and said:&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O Sohrab, an unquiet heart is thine!<br/>
Canst thou not rest among the Tartar chiefs,<br/>
And share the battle's common chance with us<br/>
Who love thee, but must press for ever first,<br/>
In single fight incurring single risk,<br/>
To find a father thou hast never seen?<br/>
That were far best, my son, to stay with us<br/>
Unmurmuring; in our tents, while it is war,<br/>
And when 'tis truce, then in Afrasiab's towns.<br/>
But, if this one desire indeed rules all,<br/>
To seek out Rustum&mdash;seek him not through fight!<br/>
Seek him in peace, and carry to his arms,<br/>
O Sohrab, carry an unwounded son!<br/>
But far hence seek him, for he is not here.<br/>
For now it is not as when I was young,<br/>
When Rustum was in front of every fray;<br/>
But now he keeps apart, and sits at home,<br/>
In Seistan, with Zal, his father old.<br/>
Whether that his own mighty strength at last<br/>
Feels the abhorr'd approaches of old age,<br/>
Or in some quarrel with the Persian King.<br/>
There go!&mdash;Thou wilt not? Yet my heart forebodes<br/>
Danger or death awaits thee on this field.<br/>
Fain would I know thee safe and well, though lost<br/>
To us; fain therefore send thee hence, in peace<br/>
To seek thy father, not seek single fights<br/>
In vain;&mdash;but who can keep the lion's cub<br/>
From ravening, and who govern Rustum's son?<br/>
Go, I will grant thee what thy heart desires."<br/>
</p>
<p>
So said he, and dropp'd Sohrab's hand, and left<br/>
His bed, and the warm rugs whereon he lay;<br/>
And o'er his chilly limbs his woollen coat<br/>
He pass'd, and tied his sandals on his feet,<br/>
And threw a white cloak round him, and he took<br/>
In his right hand a ruler's staff, no sword;<br/>
And on his head he set his sheep-skin cap,<br/>
Black, glossy, curl'd, the fleece of Kara-Kul;<br/>
And raised the curtain of his tent, and call'd<br/>
His herald to his side, and went abroad.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The sun by this had risen, and clear'd the fog<br/>
From the broad Oxus and the glittering sands.<br/>
And from their tents the Tartar horsemen filed<br/>
Into the open plain; so Haman bade&mdash;<br/>
Haman, who next to Peran-Wisa ruled<br/>
The host, and still was in his lusty prime.<br/>
From their black tents, long files of horse, they stream'd;<br/>
As when some grey November morn the files,<br/>
In marching order spread, of long-neck'd cranes<br/>
Stream over Casbin and the southern slopes<br/>
Of Elburz, from the Aralian estuaries,<br/>
Or some frore Caspian reed-bed, southward bound<br/>
For the warm Persian sea-board&mdash;so they stream'd.<br/>
The Tartars of the Oxus, the King's guard,<br/>
First, with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears;<br/>
Large men, large steeds; who from Bokhara come<br/>
And Khiva, and ferment the milk of mares.<br/>
Next, the more temperate Toorkmuns of the south,<br/>
The Tukas, and the lances of Salore,<br/>
And those from Attruck and the Caspian sands;<br/>
Light men and on light steeds, who only drink<br/>
The acrid milk of camels, and their wells.<br/>
And then a swarm of wandering horse, who came<br/>
From far, and a more doubtful service own'd;<br/>
The Tartars of Ferghana, from the banks<br/>
Of the Jaxartes, men with scanty beards<br/>
And close-set skull-caps; and those wilder hordes<br/>
Who roam o'er Kipchak and the northern waste,<br/>
Kalmucks and unkempt Kuzzaks, tribes who stray<br/>
Nearest the Pole, and wandering Kirghizzes,<br/>
Who come on shaggy ponies from Pamere;<br/>
These all filed out from camp into the plain.<br/>
And on the other side the Persians form'd;&mdash;<br/>
First a light cloud of horse, Tartars they seem'd.<br/>
The Ilyats of Khorassan; and behind,<br/>
The royal troops of Persia, horse and foot,<br/>
Marshall'd battalions bright in burnish'd steel.<br/>
But Peran-Wisa with his herald came,<br/>
Threading the Tartar squadrons to the front,<br/>
And with his staff kept back the foremost ranks.<br/>
And when Ferood, who led the Persians, saw<br/>
That Peran-Wisa kept the Tartars back,<br/>
He took his spear, and to the front he came,<br/>
And check'd his ranks, and fix'd them where they stood.<br/>
And the old Tartar came upon the sand<br/>
Betwixt the silent hosts, and spake, and said:&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ferood, and ye, Persians and Tartars, hear!<br/>
Let there be truce between the hosts to-day.<br/>
But choose a champion from the Persian lords<br/>
To fight our champion Sohrab, man to man."<br/>
</p>
<p>
As, in the country, on a morn in June,<br/>
When the dew glistens on the pearled ears,<br/>
A shiver runs through the deep corn for joy&mdash;<br/>
So, when they heard what Peran-Wisa said,<br/>
A thrill through all the Tartar squadrons ran<br/>
Of pride and hope for Sohrab, whom they loved.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But as a troop of pedlars, from Cabool,<br/>
Cross underneath the Indian Caucasus,<br/>
That vast sky-neighbouring mountain of milk snow;<br/>
Crossing so high, that, as they mount, they pass<br/>
Long flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow,<br/>
Choked by the air, and scarce can they themselves<br/>
Slake their parch'd throats with sugar'd mulberries&mdash;<br/>
In single file they move, and stop their breath,<br/>
For fear they should dislodge the o'erhanging snows&mdash;<br/>
So the pale Persians held their breath with fear.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And to Ferood his brother chiefs came up<br/>
To counsel; Gudurz and Zoarrah came,<br/>
And Feraburz, who ruled the Persian host<br/>
Second, and was the uncle of the King;<br/>
These came and counsell'd, and then Gudurz said:&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ferood, shame bids us take their challenge up,<br/>
Yet champion have we none to match this youth.<br/>
He has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart.<br/>
But Rustum came last night; aloof he sits<br/>
And sullen, and has pitch'd his tents apart.<br/>
Him will I seek, and carry to his ear<br/>
The Tartar challenge, and this young man's name.<br/>
Haply he will forget his wrath, and fight.<br/>
Stand forth the while, and take their challenge up."<br/>
</p>
<p>
So spake he; and Ferood stood forth and cried:&mdash;<br/>
"Old man, be it agreed as thou hast said!<br/>
Let Sohrab arm, and we will find a man."<br/>
He spake: and Peran-Wisa turn'd, and strode<br/>
Back through the opening squadrons to his tent.<br/>
But through the anxious Persians Gudurz ran,<br/>
And cross'd the camp which lay behind, and reach'd,<br/>
Out on the sands beyond it, Rustum's tents.<br/>
Of scarlet cloth they were, and glittering gay,<br/>
Just pitch'd; the high pavilion in the midst<br/>
Was Rustum's, and his men lay camp'd around.<br/>
And Gudurz enter'd Rustum's tent, and found<br/>
Rustum; his morning meal was done, but still<br/>
The table stood before him, charged with food&mdash;<br/>
A side of roasted sheep, and cakes of bread;<br/>
And dark green melons; and there Rustum sate<br/>
Listless, and held a falcon on his wrist,<br/>
And play'd with it; but Gudurz came and stood<br/>
Before him; and he look'd, and saw him stand,<br/>
And with a cry sprang up and dropp'd the bird,<br/>
And greeted Gudurz with both hands, and said:&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Welcome! these eyes could see no better sight.<br/>
What news? but sit down first, and eat and drink."<br/>
</p>
<p>
But Gudurz stood in the tent-door, and said:&mdash;<br/>
"Not now! a time will come to eat and drink,<br/>
But not to-day; to-day has other needs.<br/>
The armies are drawn out, and stand at gaze;<br/>
For from the Tartars is a challenge brought<br/>
To pick a champion from the Persian lords<br/>
To fight their champion&mdash;and thou know'st his name&mdash;<br/>
Sohrab men call him, but his birth is hid.<br/>
O Rustum, like thy might is this young man's!<br/>
He has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart;<br/>
And he is young, and Iran's chiefs are old,<br/>
Or else too weak; and all eyes turn to thee.<br/>
Come down and help us, Rustum, or we lose!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke; but Rustum answer'd with a smile:&mdash;<br/>
"Go to! if Iran's chiefs are old, then I<br/>
Am older; if the young are weak, the King<br/>
Errs strangely; for the King, for Kai Khosroo,<br/>
Himself is young, and honours younger men,<br/>
And lets the aged moulder to their graves.<br/>
Rustum he loves no more, but loves the young&mdash;<br/>
The young may rise at Sohrab's vaunts, not I.<br/>
For what care I, though all speak Sohrab's fame?<br/>
For would that I myself had such a son,<br/>
And not that one slight helpless girl I have&mdash;<br/>
A son so famed, so brave, to send to war,<br/>
And I to tarry with the snow-hair'd Zal,<br/>
My father, whom the robber Afghans vex,<br/>
And clip his borders short, and drive his herds,<br/>
And he has none to guard his weak old age.<br/>
There would I go, and hang my armour up,<br/>
And with my great name fence that weak old man,<br/>
And spend the goodly treasures I have got,<br/>
And rest my age, and hear of Sohrab's fame,<br/>
And leave to death the hosts of thankless kings,<br/>
And with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and smiled; and Gudurz made reply:&mdash;<br/>
"What then, O Rustum, will men say to this,<br/>
When Sohrab dares our bravest forth, and seeks<br/>
Thee most of all, and thou, whom most he seeks,<br/>
Hidest thy face? Take heed lest men should say:<br/>
Like some old miser, Rustum hoards his fame,<br/>
And shuns to peril it with younger men."<br/>
</p>
<p>
And, greatly moved, then Rustum made reply:&mdash;<br/>
"O Gudurz, wherefore dost thou say such words?<br/>
Thou knowest better words than this to say.<br/>
What is one more, one less, obscure or famed,<br/>
Valiant or craven, young or old, to me?<br/>
Are not they mortal, am not I myself?<br/>
But who for men of nought would do great deeds?<br/>
Come, thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his fame!<br/>
But I will fight unknown, and in plain arms;<br/>
Let not men say of Rustum, he was match'd<br/>
In single fight with any mortal man."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and frown'd; and Gudurz turn'd, and ran<br/>
Back quickly through the camp in fear and joy&mdash;<br/>
Fear at his wrath, but joy that Rustum came.<br/>
But Rustum strode to his tent-door, and call'd<br/>
His followers in, and bade them bring his arms,<br/>
And clad himself in steel; the arms he chose<br/>
Were plain, and on his shield was no device,<br/>
Only his helm was rich, inlaid with gold,<br/>
And, from the fluted spine atop, a plume<br/>
Of horsehair waved, a scarlet horsehair plume.<br/>
So arm'd, he issued forth; and Ruksh, his horse,<br/>
Follow'd him like a faithful hound at heel&mdash;<br/>
Ruksh, whose renown was noised through all the earth,<br/>
The horse, whom Rustum on a foray once<br/>
Did in Bokhara by the river find<br/>
A colt beneath its dam, and drove him home,<br/>
And rear'd him; a bright bay, with lofty crest,<br/>
Dight with a saddle-cloth of broider'd green<br/>
Crusted with gold, and on the ground were work'd<br/>
All beasts of chase, all beasts which hunters know.<br/>
So follow'd, Rustum left his tents, and cross'd<br/>
The camp, and to the Persian host appear'd.<br/>
And all the Persians knew him, and with shouts<br/>
Hail'd; but the Tartars knew not who he was.<br/>
And dear as the wet diver to the eyes<br/>
Of his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore,<br/>
By sandy Bahrein, in the Persian Gulf,<br/>
Plunging all day in the blue waves, at night,<br/>
Having made up his tale of precious pearls,<br/>
Rejoins her in their hut upon the sands&mdash;<br/>
So dear to the pale Persians Rustum came.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And Rustum to the Persian front advanced,<br/>
And Sohrab arm'd in Haman's tent, and came.<br/>
And as afield the reapers cut a swath<br/>
Down through the middle of a rich man's corn,<br/>
And on each side are squares of standing corn,<br/>
And in the midst a stubble, short and bare&mdash;<br/>
So on each side were squares of men, with spears<br/>
Bristling, and in the midst, the open sand.<br/>
And Rustum came upon the sand, and cast<br/>
His eyes toward the Tartar tents, and saw<br/>
Sohrab come forth, and eyed him as he came.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As some rich woman, on a winter's morn,<br/>
Eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge<br/>
Who with numb blacken'd fingers makes her fire&mdash;<br/>
At cock-crow, on a starlit winter's morn,<br/>
When the frost flowers the whiten'd window-panes&mdash;<br/>
And wonders how she lives, and what the thoughts<br/>
Of that poor drudge may be; so Rustum eyed<br/>
The unknown adventurous youth, who from afar<br/>
Came seeking Rustum, and defying forth<br/>
All the most valiant chiefs; long he perused<br/>
His spirited air, and wonder'd who he was.<br/>
For very young he seem'd, tenderly rear'd;<br/>
Like some young cypress, tall, and dark, and straight,<br/>
Which in a queen's secluded garden throws<br/>
Its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf,<br/>
By midnight, to a bubbling fountain's sound&mdash;<br/>
So slender Sohrab seem'd, so softly rear'd.<br/>
And a deep pity enter'd Rustum's soul<br/>
As he beheld him coming; and he stood,<br/>
And beckon'd to him with his hand, and said:&mdash;<br/>
"O thou young man, the air of Heaven is soft,<br/>
And warm, and pleasant; but the grave is cold!<br/>
Heaven's air is better than the cold dead grave.<br/>
Behold me! I am vast, and clad in iron,<br/>
And tried; and I have stood on many a field<br/>
Of blood, and I have fought with many a foe&mdash;<br/>
Never was that field lost, or that foe saved.<br/>
O Sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on death?<br/>
Be govern'd! quit the Tartar host, and come<br/>
To Iran, and be as my son to me,<br/>
And fight beneath my banner till I die!<br/>
There are no youths in Iran brave as thou."<br/>
So he spake, mildly; Sohrab heard his voice,<br/>
The mighty voice of Rustum, and he saw<br/>
His giant figure planted on the sand,<br/>
Sole, like some single tower, which a chief<br/>
Hath builded on the waste in former years<br/>
Against the robbers; and he saw that head,<br/>
Streak'd with its first grey hairs;&mdash;hope filled his soul,<br/>
And he ran forward and embraced his knees,<br/>
And clasp'd his hand within his own, and said:&mdash;<br/>
"O, by thy father's head! by thine own soul<br/>
Art thou not Rustum? speak! art thou not he?"<br/>
But Rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth,<br/>
And turn'd away, and spake to his own soul:&mdash;<br/>
"Ah me, I muse what this young fox may mean!<br/>
False, wily, boastful, are these Tartar boys.<br/>
For if I now confess this thing he asks,<br/>
And hide it not, but say: Rustum is here!<br/>
He will not yield indeed, nor quit our foes,<br/>
But he will find some pretext not to fight,<br/>
And praise my fame, and proffer courteous gifts<br/>
A belt or sword perhaps, and go his way.<br/>
And on a feast-tide, in Afrasiab's hall,<br/>
In Samarcand, he will arise and cry:<br/>
'I challenged once, when the two armies camp'd<br/>
Beside the Oxus, all the Persian lords<br/>
To cope with me in single fight; but they<br/>
Shrank, only Rustum dared; then he and I<br/>
Changed gifts, and went on equal terms away.'<br/>
So will he speak, perhaps, while men applaud;<br/>
Then were the chiefs of Iran shamed through me."<br/>
</p>
<p>
And then he turn'd, and sternly spake aloud:&mdash;<br/>
"Rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus<br/>
Of Rustum? I am here, whom thou hast call'd<br/>
By challenge forth; make good thy vaunt, or yield!<br/>
Is it with Rustum only thou wouldst fight?<br/>
Rash boy, men look on Rustum's face and flee!<br/>
For well I know, that did great Rustum stand<br/>
Before thy face this day, and were reveal'd,<br/>
There would be then no talk of fighting more.<br/>
But being what I am, I tell thee this&mdash;<br/>
Do thou record it in thine inmost soul:<br/>
Either thou shalt renounce thy vaunt and yield,<br/>
Or else thy bones shall strew this sand, till winds<br/>
Bleach them, or Oxus with his summer-floods,<br/>
Oxus in summer wash them all away."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke; and Sohrab answer'd, on his feet:&mdash;<br/>
"Art thou so fierce? Thou wilt not fright me so!<br/>
I am no girl to be made pale by words.<br/>
Yet this thou hast said well, did Rustum stand<br/>
Here on this field, there were no fighting then.<br/>
But Rustum is far hence, and we stand here.<br/>
Begin! thou art more vast, more dread than I,<br/>
And thou art proved, I know, and I am young&mdash;<br/>
But yet success sways with the breath of Heaven.<br/>
And though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure<br/>
Thy victory, yet thou canst not surely know.<br/>
For we are all, like swimmers in the sea,<br/>
Poised on the top of a huge wave of fate,<br/>
Which hangs uncertain to which side to fall.<br/>
And whether it will heave us up to land,<br/>
Or whether it will roll us out to sea,<br/>
Back out to sea, to the deep waves of death,<br/>
We know not, and no search will make us know;<br/>
Only the event will teach us in its hour."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and Rustum answer'd not, but hurl'd<br/>
His spear; down from the shoulder, down it came,<br/>
As on some partridge, in the corn a hawk,<br/>
That long has tower'd in the airy clouds,<br/>
Drops like a plummet; Sohrab saw it come,<br/>
And sprang aside, quick as a flash; the spear<br/>
Hiss'd, and went quivering down into the sand,<br/>
Which it sent flying wide;&mdash;then Sohrab threw<br/>
In turn, and full struck Rustum's shield; sharp rang,<br/>
The iron plates rang sharp, but turn'd the spear.<br/>
And Rustum seized his club, which none but he<br/>
Could wield; an unlopp'd trunk it was, and huge,<br/>
Still rough&mdash;like those which men in treeless plains<br/>
To build them boats fish from the flooded rivers,<br/>
Hyphasis or Hydaspes, when, high up<br/>
By their dark springs, the wind in winter-time<br/>
Hath made in Himalayan forests wrack,<br/>
And strewn the channels with torn boughs&mdash;so huge<br/>
The club which Rustum lifted now, and struck<br/>
One stroke; but again Sohrab sprang aside,<br/>
Lithe as the glancing snake, and the club came<br/>
Thundering to earth, and leapt from Rustum's hand.<br/>
And Rustum follow'd his own blow, and fell<br/>
To his knees, and with his fingers clutch'd the sand;<br/>
And now might Sohrab have unsheathed his sword,<br/>
And pierced the mighty Rustum while he lay<br/>
Dizzy, and on his knees, and choked with sand;<br/>
But he look'd on, and smiled, nor bared his sword,<br/>
But courteously drew back, and spoke, and said:&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thou strik'st too hard! that club of thine will float<br/>
Upon the summer-floods, and not my bones.<br/>
But rise, and be not wroth! not wroth am I;<br/>
No, when I see thee, wrath forsakes my soul.<br/>
Thou say'st, thou art not Rustum; be it so!<br/>
Who art thou then, that canst so touch my soul?<br/>
Boy as I am, I have seen battles too&mdash;<br/>
Have waded foremost in their bloody waves,<br/>
And heard their hollow roar of dying men;<br/>
But never was my heart thus touch'd before.<br/>
Are they from Heaven, these softenings of the heart?<br/>
O thou old warrior, let us yield to Heaven!<br/>
Come, plant we here in earth our angry spears,<br/>
And make a truce, and sit upon this sand,<br/>
And pledge each other in red wine, like friends,<br/>
And thou shalt talk to me of Rustum's deeds.<br/>
There are enough foes in the Persian host,<br/>
Whom I may meet, and strike, and feel no pang;<br/>
Champions enough Afrasiab has, whom thou<br/>
Mayst fight; fight them, when they confront thy spear!<br/>
But oh, let there be peace 'twixt thee and me!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
He ceased, but while he spake, Rustum had risen,<br/>
And stood erect, trembling with rage; his club<br/>
He left to lie, but had regain'd his spear,<br/>
Whose fiery point now in his mail'd right-hand<br/>
Blazed bright and baleful, like that autumn-star,<br/>
The baleful sign of fevers; dust had soil'd<br/>
His stately crest, and dimm'd his glittering arms.<br/>
His breast heaved, his lips foam'd, and twice his voice<br/>
Was choked with rage; at last these words broke way:&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Girl! nimble with thy feet, not with thy hands!<br/>
Curl'd minion, dancer, coiner of sweet words!<br/>
Fight, let me hear thy hateful voice no more!<br/>
Thou art not in Afrasiab's gardens now<br/>
With Tartar girls, with whom thou art wont to dance;<br/>
But on the Oxus-sands, and in the dance<br/>
Of battle, and with me, who make no play<br/>
Of war; I fight it out, and hand to hand.<br/>
Speak not to me of truce, and pledge, and wine!<br/>
Remember all thy valour; try thy feints<br/>
And cunning! all the pity I had is gone;<br/>
Because thou hast shamed me before both the hosts<br/>
With thy light skipping tricks, and thy girl's wiles."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke, and Sohrab kindled at his taunts,<br/>
And he too drew his sword; at once they rush'd<br/>
Together, as two eagles on one prey<br/>
Come rushing down together from the clouds,<br/>
One from the east, one from the west; their shields<br/>
Bash'd with a clang together, and a din<br/>
Rose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters<br/>
Make often in the forest's heart at morn,<br/>
Of hewing axes, crashing trees&mdash;such blows<br/>
Rustum and Sohrab on each other hail'd.<br/>
And you would say that sun and stars took part<br/>
In that unnatural conflict; for a cloud<br/>
Grew suddenly in Heaven, and dark'd the sun<br/>
Over the fighters' heads; and a wind rose<br/>
Under their feet, and moaning swept the plain,<br/>
And in a sandy whirlwind wrapp'd the pair.<br/>
In gloom they twain were wrapp'd, and they alone;<br/>
For both the on-looking hosts on either hand<br/>
Stood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure,<br/>
And the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream.<br/>
But in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes<br/>
And labouring breath; first Rustum struck the shield<br/>
Which Sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear<br/>
Rent the tough plates, but fail'd to reach the skin,<br/>
And Rustum pluck'd it back with angry groan.<br/>
Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum's helm,<br/>
Nor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest<br/>
He shore away, and that proud horsehair plume,<br/>
Never till now defiled, sank to the dust;<br/>
And Rustum bow'd his head; but then the gloom<br/>
Grew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air,<br/>
And lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh, the horse,<br/>
Who stood at hand, utter'd a dreadful cry;&mdash;<br/>
No horse's cry was that, most like the roar<br/>
Of some pain'd desert-lion, who all day<br/>
Hath trail'd the hunter's javelin in his side,<br/>
And comes at night to die upon the sand.<br/>
The two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for fear,<br/>
And Oxus curdled as it cross'd his stream.<br/>
But Sohrab heard, and quail'd not, but rush'd on,<br/>
And struck again; and again Rustum bow'd<br/>
His head; but this time all the blade, like glass,<br/>
Sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm,<br/>
And in the hand the hilt remain'd alone.<br/>
Then Rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes<br/>
Glared, and he shook on high his menacing spear,<br/>
And shouted: Rustum!&mdash;Sohrab heard that shout,<br/>
And shrank amazed; back he recoil'd one step,<br/>
And scann'd with blinking eyes the advancing form;<br/>
And then he stood bewilder'd; and he dropp'd<br/>
His covering shield, and the spear pierced his side.<br/>
He reel'd, and staggering back, sank to the ground;<br/>
And then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell,<br/>
And the bright sun broke forth, and melted all<br/>
The cloud; and the two armies saw the pair&mdash;<br/>
Saw Rustum standing, safe upon his feet,<br/>
And Sohrab, wounded, on the bloody sand.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then, with a bitter smile, Rustum began:&mdash;<br/>
"Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill<br/>
A Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse,<br/>
And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab's tent.<br/>
Or else that the great Rustum would come down<br/>
Himself to fight, and that thy wiles would move<br/>
His heart to take a gift, and let thee go.<br/>
And then that all the Tartar host would praise<br/>
Thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame,<br/>
To glad thy father in his weak old age.<br/>
Fool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man!<br/>
Dearer to the red jackals shalt thou be<br/>
Than to thy friends, and to thy father old."<br/>
</p>
<p>
And, with a fearless mien, Sohrab replied:&mdash;<br/>
"Unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain<br/>
Thou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man!<br/>
No! Rustum slays me, and this filial heart.<br/>
For were I match'd with ten such men as thee,<br/>
And I were that which till to-day I was,<br/>
They should be lying here, I standing there<br/>
But that belovéd name unnerved my arm&mdash;<br/>
That name, and something, I confess, in thee,<br/>
Which troubles all my heart, and made my shield<br/>
Fall; and thy spear transfix'd an unarm'd foe.<br/>
And now thou boastest, and insult'st my fate.<br/>
But hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear<br/>
The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!<br/>
My father, whom I seek through all the world,<br/>
He shall avenge my death, and punish thee!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
As when some hunter in the spring hath found<br/>
A breeding eagle sitting on her nest,<br/>
Upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake,<br/>
And pierced her with an arrow as she rose,<br/>
And follow'd her to find her where she fell<br/>
Far off;&mdash;anon her mate comes winging back<br/>
From hunting, and a great way off descries<br/>
His huddling young left sole; at that, he checks<br/>
His pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps<br/>
Circles above his eyry, with loud screams<br/>
Chiding his mate back to her nest; but she<br/>
Lies dying, with the arrow in her side,<br/>
In some far stony gorge out of his ken,<br/>
A heap of fluttering feathers&mdash;never more<br/>
Shall the lake glass her, flying over it;<br/>
Never the black and dripping precipices<br/>
Echo her stormy scream as she sails by&mdash;<br/>
As that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss,<br/>
So Rustum knew not his own loss, but stood<br/>
Over his dying son, and knew him not.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But, with a cold incredulous voice, he said:&mdash;<br/>
"What prate is this of fathers and revenge?<br/>
The mighty Rustum never had a son."<br/>
</p>
<p>
And, with a failing voice, Sohrab replied:&mdash;<br/>
"Ah yes, he had! and that lost son am I.<br/>
Surely the news will one day reach his ear,<br/>
Reach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries long,<br/>
Somewhere, I know not where, but far from here;<br/>
And pierce him like a stab, and make him leap<br/>
To arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee.<br/>
Fierce man, bethink thee, for an only son!<br/>
What will that grief, what will that vengeance be?<br/>
Oh, could I live, till I that grief had seen!<br/>
Yet him I pity not so much, but her,<br/>
My mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells<br/>
With that old king, her father, who grows grey<br/>
With age, and rules over the valiant Koords.<br/>
Her most I pity, who no more will see<br/>
Sohrab returning from the Tartar camp,<br/>
With spoils and honour, when the war is done.<br/>
But a dark rumour will be bruited up,<br/>
From tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear;<br/>
And then will that defenceless woman learn<br/>
That Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more,<br/>
But that in battle with a nameless foe,<br/>
By the far-distant Oxus, he is slain."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke; and as he ceased, he wept aloud,<br/>
Thinking of her he left, and his own death.<br/>
He spoke; but Rustum listen'd, plunged in thought.<br/>
Nor did he yet believe it was his son<br/>
Who spoke, although he call'd back names he knew;<br/>
For he had had sure tidings that the babe,<br/>
Which was in Ader-baijan born to him,<br/>
Had been a puny girl, no boy at all&mdash;<br/>
So that sad mother sent him word, for fear<br/>
Rustum should seek the boy, to train in arms&mdash;<br/>
And so he deem'd that either Sohrab took,<br/>
By a false boast, the style of Rustum's son;<br/>
Or that men gave it him, to swell his fame.<br/>
So deem'd he; yet he listen'd, plunged in thought<br/>
And his soul set to grief, as the vast tide<br/>
Of the bright rocking Ocean sets to shore<br/>
At the full moon; tears gather'd in his eyes;<br/>
For he remember'd his own early youth,<br/>
And all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn,<br/>
The shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries<br/>
A far, bright city, smitten by the sun,<br/>
Through many rolling clouds&mdash;so Rustum saw<br/>
His youth; saw Sohrab's mother, in her bloom;<br/>
And that old king, her father, who loved well<br/>
His wandering guest, and gave him his fair child<br/>
With joy; and all the pleasant life they led,<br/>
They three, in that long-distant summer-time&mdash;<br/>
The castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt<br/>
And hound, and morn on those delightful hills<br/>
In Ader-baijan. And he saw that Youth,<br/>
Of age and looks to be his own dear son,<br/>
Piteous and lovely, lying on the sand;<br/>
Like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe<br/>
Of an unskilful gardener has been cut,<br/>
Mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed,<br/>
And lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom,<br/>
On the mown, dying grass&mdash;so Sohrab lay,<br/>
Lovely in death, upon the common sand.<br/>
And Rustum gazed on him with grief, and said:&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son<br/>
Whom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved.<br/>
Yet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else men<br/>
Have told thee false&mdash;thou art not Rustum's son.<br/>
For Rustum had no son; one child he had&mdash;<br/>
But one&mdash;a girl; who with her mother now<br/>
Plies some light female task, nor dreams of us&mdash;<br/>
Of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war."<br/>
</p>
<p>
But Sohrab answer'd him in wrath; for now<br/>
The anguish of the deep-fix'd spear grew fierce,<br/>
And he desired to draw forth the steel,<br/>
And let the blood flow free, and so to die&mdash;<br/>
But first he would convince his stubborn foe;<br/>
And, rising sternly on one arm, he said:&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Man, who art thou who dost deny my words?<br/>
Truth sits upon the lips of dying men,<br/>
And falsehood, while I lived, was far from mine.<br/>
I tell thee, prick'd upon this arm I bear<br/>
That seal which Rustum to my mother gave,<br/>
That she might prick it on the babe she bore."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke; and all the blood left Rustum's cheeks,<br/>
And his knees totter'd, and he smote his hand<br/>
Against his breast, his heavy mailed hand,<br/>
That the hard iron corslet clank'd aloud;<br/>
And to his heart he press'd the other hand,<br/>
And in a hollow voice he spake, and said:&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Sohrab, that were a proof which could not lie!<br/>
If thou show this, then art thou Rustum's son."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then, with weak hasty fingers, Sohrab loosed<br/>
His belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm,<br/>
And show'd a sign in faint vermilion points<br/>
Prick'd; as a cunning workman, in Pekin,<br/>
Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase,<br/>
An emperor's gift&mdash;at early morn he paints,<br/>
And all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp<br/>
Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands&mdash;<br/>
So delicately prick'd the sign appear'd<br/>
On Sohrab's arm, the sign of Rustum's seal.<br/>
It was that griffin, which of old rear'd Zal,<br/>
Rustum's great father, whom they left to die,<br/>
A helpless babe, among the mountain-rocks;<br/>
Him that kind creature found, and rear'd, and loved&mdash;<br/>
Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign.<br/>
And Sohrab bared that image on his arm,<br/>
And himself scann'd it long with mournful eyes,<br/>
And then he touch'd it with his hand and said:&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"How say'st thou? Is that sign the proper sign<br/>
Of Rustum's son, or of some other man's?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke; but Rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood<br/>
Speechless; and then he utter'd one sharp cry:<br/>
O boy&mdash;thy father!&mdash;and his voice choked there.<br/>
And then a dark cloud pass'd before his eyes,<br/>
And his head swam, and he sank down to earth.<br/>
But Sohrab crawl'd to where he lay, and cast<br/>
His arms about his neck, and kiss'd his lips,<br/>
And with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks,<br/>
Trying to call him back to life; and life<br/>
Came back to Rustum, and he oped his eyes,<br/>
And they stood wide with horror; and he seized<br/>
In both his hands the dust which lay around,<br/>
And threw it on his head, and smirch'd his hair,&mdash;<br/>
His hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms;<br/>
And strong convulsive groanings shook his breast,<br/>
And his sobs choked him; and he clutch'd his sword,<br/>
To draw it, and for ever let life out.<br/>
But Sohrab saw his thought, and held his hands,<br/>
And with a soothing voice he spake, and said:&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Father, forbear! for I but meet to-day<br/>
The doom which at my birth was written down<br/>
In Heaven, and thou art Heaven's unconscious hand.<br/>
Surely my heart cried out that it was thou,<br/>
When first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke too,<br/>
I know it! but fate trod those promptings down<br/>
Under its iron heel; fate, fate engaged<br/>
The strife, and hurl'd me on my father's spear.<br/>
But let us speak no more of this! I find<br/>
My father; let me feel that I have found!<br/>
Come, sit beside me on this sand, and take<br/>
My head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks,<br/>
And wash them with thy tears, and say: My son!<br/>
Quick! quick! for number'd are my sands of life,<br/>
And swift; for like the lightning to this field<br/>
I came, and like the wind I go away&mdash;<br/>
Sudden, and swift, and like a passing wind.<br/>
But it was writ in Heaven that this should be."<br/>
</p>
<p>
So said he, and his voice released the heart<br/>
Of Rustum, and his tears brake forth; he cast<br/>
His arms round his son's neck, and wept aloud,<br/>
And kiss'd him. And awe fell on both the hosts,<br/>
When they saw Rustum's grief; and Ruksh, the horse,<br/>
With his head bowing to the ground and mane<br/>
Sweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe<br/>
First to the one then to the other moved<br/>
His head, as if inquiring what their grief<br/>
Might mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes,<br/>
The big warm tears roll'd down, and caked the sand.<br/>
But Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said:&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet<br/>
Should first have rotted on their nimble joints,<br/>
Or ere they brought thy master to this field!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
But Sohrab look'd upon the horse and said:&mdash;<br/>
"Is this, then, Ruksh? How often, in past days,<br/>
My mother told me of thee, thou brave steed,<br/>
My terrible father's terrible horse! and said,<br/>
That I should one day find thy lord and thee.<br/>
Come, let me lay my hand upon thy mane!<br/>
O Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than I;<br/>
For thou hast gone where I shall never go,<br/>
And snuff'd the breezes of my father's home.<br/>
And thou hast trod the sands of Seistan,<br/>
And seen the River of Helmund, and the Lake<br/>
Of Zirrah; and the aged Zal himself<br/>
Has often stroked thy neck, and given thee food,<br/>
Corn in a golden platter soak'd with wine,<br/>
And said: O Ruksh! bear Rustum well!&mdash;but I<br/>
Have never known my grandsire's furrow'd face,<br/>
Nor seen his lofty house in Seistan,<br/>
Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream;<br/>
But lodged among my father's foes, and seen<br/>
Afrasiab's cities only, Samarcand,<br/>
Bokhara, and lone Khiva in the waste,<br/>
And the black Toorkmun tents; and only drunk<br/>
The desert rivers, Moorghab and Tejend,<br/>
Kohik, and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep,<br/>
The northern Sir; and this great Oxus stream,<br/>
The yellow Oxus, by whose brink I die."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then, with a heavy groan, Rustum bewail'd:&mdash;<br/>
"Oh, that its waves were flowing over me!<br/>
Oh, that I saw its grains of yellow silt<br/>
Roll tumbling in the current o'er my head!"<br/>
</p>
<p>
But, with a grave mild voice, Sohrab replied:&mdash;<br/>
"Desire not that, my father! thou must live.<br/>
For some are born to do great deeds, and live,<br/>
As some are born to be obscured, and die.<br/>
Do thou the deeds I die too young to do,<br/>
And reap a second glory in thine age;<br/>
Thou art my father, and thy gain is mine.<br/>
But come! thou seest this great host of men<br/>
Which follow me; I pray thee, slay not these!<br/>
Let me entreat for them; what have they done?<br/>
They follow'd me, my hope, my fame, my star.<br/>
Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace.<br/>
But me thou must bear hence, not send with them,<br/>
But carry me with thee to Seistan,<br/>
And place me on a bed, and mourn for me,<br/>
Thou, and the snow-hair'd Zal, and all thy friends.<br/>
And thou must lay me in that lovely earth,<br/>
And heap a stately mound above my bones,<br/>
And plant a far-seen pillar over all.<br/>
That so the passing horseman on the waste<br/>
May see my tomb a great way off, and cry:<br/>
Sohrab, the mighty Rustum's son, lies there,<br/>
Whom his great father did in ignorance kill!<br/>
And I be not forgotten in my grave."<br/>
</p>
<p>
And, with a mournful voice, Rustum replied:&mdash;<br/>
"Fear not! as thou hast said, Sohrab, my son,<br/>
So shall it be; for I will burn my tents,<br/>
And quit the host, and bear thee hence with me,<br/>
And carry thee away to Seistan,<br/>
And place thee on a bed, and mourn for thee,<br/>
With the snow-headed Zal, and all my friends.<br/>
And I will lay thee in that lovely earth,<br/>
And heap a stately mound above thy bones,<br/>
And plant a far-seen pillar over all,<br/>
And men shall not forget thee in thy grave.<br/>
And I will spare thy host; yea, let them go!<br/>
Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace!<br/>
What should I do with slaying any more?<br/>
For would that all that I have ever slain<br/>
Might be once more alive; my bitterest foes,<br/>
And they who were call'd champions in their time,<br/>
And through whose death I won that fame I have&mdash;<br/>
And I were nothing but a common man,<br/>
A poor, mean soldier, and without renown,<br/>
So thou mightest live too, my son, my son!<br/>
Or rather would that I, even I myself,<br/>
Might now be lying on this bloody sand,<br/>
Near death, and by an ignorant stroke of thine,<br/>
Not thou of mine! and I might die, not thou;<br/>
And I, not thou, be borne to Seistan;<br/>
And Zal might weep above my grave, not thine;<br/>
And say: O son, I weep thee not too sore,<br/>
For willingly, I know, thou met'st thine end!<br/>
But now in blood and battles was my youth,<br/>
And full of blood and battles is my age,<br/>
And I shall never end this life of blood."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then, at the point of death, Sohrab replied:&mdash;<br/>
"A life of blood indeed, thou dreadful man!<br/>
But thou shalt yet have peace; only not now,<br/>
Not yet! but thou shalt have it on that day,<br/>
When thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship,<br/>
Thou and the other peers of Kai Khosroo,<br/>
Returning home over the salt blue sea,<br/>
From laying thy dear master in his grave."<br/>
</p>
<p>
And Rustum gazed in Sohrab's face, and said:&mdash;<br/>
"Soon be that day, my son, and deep that sea!<br/>
Till then, if fate so wills, let me endure."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He spoke; and Sohrab smiled on him, and took<br/>
The spear, and drew it from his side, and eased<br/>
His wound's imperious anguish; but the blood<br/>
Came welling from the open gash, and life<br/>
Flow'd with the stream;&mdash;all down his cold white side<br/>
The crimson torrent ran, dim now and soil'd,<br/>
Like the soil'd tissue of white violets<br/>
Left, freshly gather'd, on their native bank,<br/>
By children whom their nurses call with haste<br/>
Indoors from the sun's eye; his head droop'd low,<br/>
His limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay&mdash;<br/>
White, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps,<br/>
Deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame,<br/>
Convulsed him back to life, he open'd them,<br/>
And fix'd them feebly on his father's face;<br/>
Till now all strength was ebb'd, and from his limbs<br/>
Unwillingly the spirit fled away,<br/>
Regretting the warm mansion which it left,<br/>
And youth, and bloom, and this delightful world.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So, on the bloody sand, Sohrab lay dead;<br/>
And the great Rustum drew his horseman's cloak<br/>
Down o'er his face, and sate by his dead son.<br/>
As those black granite pillars, once high-rear'd<br/>
By Jemshid in Persepolis, to bear<br/>
His house, now 'mid their broken flights of steps<br/>
Lie prone, enormous, down the mountain side&mdash;<br/>
So in the sand lay Rustum by his son.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And night came down over the solemn waste,<br/>
And the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair,<br/>
And darken'd all; and a cold fog, with night,<br/>
Crept from the Oxus. Soon a hum arose,<br/>
As of a great assembly loosed, and fires<br/>
Began to twinkle through the fog; for now<br/>
Both armies moved to camp, and took their meal;<br/>
The Persians took it on the open sands<br/>
Southward, the Tartars by the river marge;<br/>
And Rustum and his son were left alone.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But the majestic river floated on,<br/>
Out of the mist and hum of that low land,<br/>
Into the frosty starlight, and there moved,<br/>
Rejoicing, through the hush'd Chorasmian waste,<br/>
Under the solitary moon;&mdash;he flow'd<br/>
Right for the polar star, past Orgunjè,<br/>
Brimming, and bright, and large; then sands begin<br/>
To hem his watery march, and dam his streams,<br/>
And split his currents; that for many a league<br/>
The shorn and parcell'd Oxus strains along<br/>
Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles&mdash;<br/>
Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had<br/>
In his high mountain-cradle in Pamere,<br/>
A foil'd circuitous wanderer&mdash;till at last<br/>
The long'd-for dash of waves is heard, and wide<br/>
His luminous home of waters opens, bright<br/>
And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars<br/>
Emerge, and shine upon the Aral Sea.<br/>

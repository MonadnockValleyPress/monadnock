<h1>Self-Dependence</h1>
<h2>by Matthew Arnold</h2>
<p>
Weary of myself, and sick of asking<br/>
What I am, and what I ought to be,<br/>
At this vessel's prow I stand, which bears me<br/>
Forwards, forwards, o'er the starlit sea.
</p>
<p>
And a look of passionate desire<br/>
O'er the sea and to the stars I send:<br/>
"Ye who from my childhood up have calmed me,<br/>
Calm me, ah, compose me to the end!
</p>
<p>
Ah, once more," I cried, "ye stars, ye waters,<br/>
On my heart your mighty charm renew;<br/>
Still, still let me, as I gaze upon you,<br/>
Feel my soul becoming vast like you!"
</p>
<p>
From the intense, clear, star-sown vault of heaven,<br/>
Over the lit sea's unquiet way,<br/>
In the rustling night-air came the answer,&mdash;<br/>
"Wouldst thou be as these are? Live as they.
</p>
<p>
"Unaffrighted by the silence round them,<br/>
Undistracted by the sights they see,<br/>
These demand not that the things without them<br/>
Yield them love, amusement, sympathy.
</p>
<p>
"And with joy the stars perform their shining,<br/>
And the sea its long moon-silvered roll;<br/>
For self-poised they live, nor pine with noting<br/>
All the fever of some differing soul.
</p>
<p>
"Bounded by themselves, and unregardful<br/>
In what state God's other works may be,<br/>
In their own tasks all their powers pouring,<br/>
These attain the mighty life you see."
</p>
<p>
O air-born voice! long since, severely clear,<br/>
A cry like thine in mine own heart I hear,&mdash;<br/>
"Resolve to be thyself; and know, that he<br/>
Who finds himself loses his misery!"

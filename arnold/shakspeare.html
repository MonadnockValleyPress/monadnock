<h1>Shakspeare</h1>
<h2>by Matthew Arnold</h2>
<p>
Others abide our question. Thou art free.<br/>
We ask and ask. Thou smilest, and art still,<br/>
Out-topping knowledge. For the loftiest hill,<br/>
Who to the stars uncrowns his majesty,
</p>
<p>
Planting his steadfast footsteps in the sea,<br/>
Making the heaven of heavens his dwelling-place,<br/>
Spares but the cloudy border of his base<br/>
To the foiled searching of mortality;
</p>
<p>
And thou, who didst the stars and sunbeams know,<br/>
Self-schooled, self-scanned, self-honored, self-secure,<br/>
Didst tread on earth unguessed at.&mdash;Better so!
</p>
<p>
All pains the immortal spirit must endure,<br/>
All weakness which impairs, all griefs which bow,<br/>
Find their sole speech in that victorious brow.
</p>

<h1>The Second Best</h1>
<h2>by Matthew Arnold</h2>
<p>
Moderate tasks and moderate leisure,<br/>
Quiet living, strict-kept measure<br/>
Both in suffering and in pleasure,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis for this thy nature yearns.
</p>
<p>
But so many books thou readest,<br/>
But so many schemes thou breedest,<br/>
But so many wishes feedest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thy poor head almost turns.
</p>
<p>
And (the world's so madly jangled,<br/>
Human things so fast entangled)<br/>
Nature's wish must now be strangled<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that best which she discerns.
</p>
<p>
So it <em>must</em> be! yet, while leading<br/>
A strained life, while over-feeding,<br/>
Like the rest, his wit with reading,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No small profit that man earns,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Who through all he meets can steer him,<br/>
Can reject what cannot clear him,<br/>
Cling to what can truly cheer him;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who each day more surely learns
</p>
<p>
That an impulse, from the distance<br/>
Of his deepest, best existence,<br/>
To the words, "Hope, Light, Persistence,"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly sets and truly burns.

<h1>To Marguerite. Continued</h1>
<h2>by Matthew Arnold</h2>
<p>(Continued from <a href='isolation.html'>Isolation</a>.)</p>
<p>
Yes! in the sea of life enisled,<br/>
With echoing straits between us thrown,<br/>
Dotting the shoreless watery wild,<br/>
We mortal millions live alone.<br/>
The islands feel the enclasping flow,<br/>
And then their endless bounds they know.
</p>
<p>
But when the moon their hollows lights,<br/>
And they are swept by balms of spring,<br/>
And in their glens, on starry nights,<br/>
The nightingales divinely sing;<br/>
And lovely notes, from shore to shore,<br/>
Across the sounds and channels pour,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Oh! then a longing like despair<br/>
Is to their farthest caverns sent;<br/>
For surely once, they feel, we were<br/>
Parts of a single continent!<br/>
Now round us spreads the watery plain:<br/>
Oh, might our marges meet again!
</p>
<p>
Who ordered that their longing's fire<br/>
Should be, as soon as kindled, cooled?<br/>
Who renders vain their deep desire?&mdash;<br/>
A God, a God their severance ruled!<br/>
And bade betwixt their shores to be<br/>
The unplumbed, salt, estranging sea.

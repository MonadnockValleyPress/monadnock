<h1>Palladium</h1>
<h2>by Matthew Arnold</h2>
<p>
Set where the upper streams of Simois flow,<br/>
Was the Palladium, high 'mid rock and wood;<br/>
And Hector was in Ilium, far below,<br/>
And fought, and saw it not; but there it stood!
</p>
<p>
It stood, and sun and moonshine rained their light<br/>
On the pure columns of its glen-built hall.<br/>
Backward and forward rolled the waves of fight<br/>
Round Troy; but while this stood, Troy could not fall.
</p>
<p>
So, in its lovely moonlight, lives the soul.<br/>
Mountains surround it, and sweet virgin air;<br/>
Cold plashing, past it, crystal waters roll:<br/>
We visit it by moments, ah, too rare!
</p>
<p>
Men will renew the battle in the plain<br/>
To-morrow: red with blood will Xanthus be;<br/>
Hector and Ajax will be there again,<br/>
Helen will come upon the wall to see.
</p>
<p>
Then we shall rust in shade, or shine in strife,<br/>
And fluctuate 'twixt blind hopes and blind despairs,<br/>
And fancy that we put forth all our life,<br/>
And never know how with the soul it fares.
</p>
<p>
Still doth the soul, from its lone fastness high,<br/>
Upon our life a ruling effluence send;<br/>
And when it fails, fight as we will, we die;<br/>
And, while it lasts, we cannot wholly end.
</p>

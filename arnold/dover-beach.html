<h1>Dover Beach</h1>
<h2>by Matthew Arnold</h2>
<p>
The sea is calm to-night.<br/>
The tide is full, the moon lies fair<br/>
Upon the straits; on the French coast, the light<br/>
Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,<br/>
Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.
</p>
<p>
Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!<br/>
Only, from the long line of spray<br/>
Where the sea meets the moon-blanched sand,<br/>
Listen! you hear the grating roar<br/>
Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,<br/>
At their return, up the high strand,<br/>
Begin and cease, and then again begin,<br/>
With tremulous cadence slow, and bring<br/>
The eternal note of sadness in.
</p>
<p>
Sophocles long ago<br/>
Heard it on the Ã†gean, and it brought<br/>
Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow<br/>
Of human misery: we<br/>
Find also in the sound a thought,<br/>
Hearing it by this distant northern sea.
</p>
<p>
The sea of faith<br/>
Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore<br/>
Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.<br/>
But now I only hear<br/>
Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,<br/>
Retreating, to the breath<br/>
Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear<br/>
And naked shingles of the world.
</p>
<p>
Ah, love, let us be true<br/>
To one another! for the world, which seems<br/>
To lie before us like a land of dreams,<br/>
So various, so beautiful, so new,<br/>
Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,<br/>
Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;<br/>
And we are here as on a darkling plain<br/>
Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,<br/>
Where ignorant armies clash by night.

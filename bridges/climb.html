<h1>"I Climb the Mossy Bank of the Glade"</h1>
<h2>by Robert Bridges</h2>
<p>
I climb the mossy bank of the glade:<br/>
My love awaiteth me in the shade.<br/>
</p>
<p>
She holdeth a book that she never heedeth:<br/>
In GoddÃ«s work her spirit readeth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
She is all to me, and I to her:<br/>
When we embrace, the stars confer.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O my love, from beyond the sky<br/>
I am calling thy heart, and who but I?<br/>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Fresh as love is the breeze of June,<br/>
In the dappled shade of the summer noon.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Catullus, throwing his heart away,<br/>
Gave fewer kisses every day.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Heracleitus, spending his youth<br/>
In search of wisdom, had less of truth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Flame of fire was the poet's desire:<br/>
The thinker found that life was fire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O my love! my song is done:<br/>
My kiss hath both their fires in one.<br/>
</p>

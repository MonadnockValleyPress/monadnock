<h1>London Snow</h1>
<h2>by Robert Bridges</h2>
<p>
When men were all asleep the snow came flying,<br/>
In large white flakes falling on the city brown,<br/>
Stealthily and perpetually settling and loosely lying,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hushing the latest traffic of the drowsy town;<br/>
Deadening, muffling, stifling its murmurs failing;<br/>
Lazily and incessantly floating down and down:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently sifting and veiling road, roof and railing;<br/>
Hiding difference, making unevenness even,<br/>
Into angles and crevices softly drifting and sailing.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All night it fell, and when full inches seven<br/>
It lay in the depth of its uncompacted lightness,<br/>
The clouds blew off from a high and frosty heaven;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all woke earlier for the unaccustomed brightness<br/>
Of the winter dawning, the strange unheavenly glare:<br/>
The eye marvelled&mdash;marvelled at the dazzling whiteness;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ear hearkened to the stillness of the solemn air;<br/>
No sound of wheel rumbling nor of foot falling,<br/>
And the busy morning cries came thin and spare.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then boys I heard, as they went to school, calling,<br/>
They gathered up the crystal manna to freeze<br/>
Their tongues with tasting, their hands with snowballing;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or rioted in a drift, plunging up to the knees;<br/>
Or peering up from under the white-mossed wonder,<br/>
'O look at the trees!' they cried, 'O look at the trees!'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lessened load a few carts creak and blunder,<br/>
Following along the white deserted way,<br/>
A country company long dispersed asunder:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When now already the sun, in pale display<br/>
Standing by Paul's high dome, spread forth below<br/>
His sparkling beams, and awoke the stir of the day.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now doors open, and war is waged with the snow;<br/>
And trains of sombre men, past tale of number,<br/>
Tread long brown paths, as toward their toil they go:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even for them awhile no cares encumber<br/>
Their minds diverted; the daily word is unspoken,<br/>
The daily thoughts of labour and sorrow slumber<br/>
At the sight of the beauty that greets them, for the charm they have broken.<br/>

<h1>Recollections of Solitude</h1>
<h2>by Robert Bridges</h2>
<p>
Ended are many days, and now but few<br/>
Remain; since therefore it is happy and true<br/>
That memoried joys keep ever their delight,<br/>
Like steadfast stars in the blue vault of night,<br/>
While hours of pain (among those heavenly spheres<br/>
Like falling meteors, the martyr's tears)<br/>
Dart their long trails at random, and anon,<br/>
Ere we exclaim, pass, and for aye are gone;<br/>
Therefore my heedy thought will oft restore<br/>
The long light-hearted days that are no more,<br/>
Save where in her memorial crypt they shine<br/>
Spangling the silent past with joy divine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But why in dream of this enchanted mood<br/>
Should all my boyhood seem a solitude?<br/>
Good reason know I, when I wander there,<br/>
In that transmuted scene, why all is fair;<br/>
The woods as when in holiday of spring<br/>
Million buds burst, and flowers are blossoming;<br/>
The meadows deep in grass, the fields unshorn<br/>
In beauty of the multitudinous corn,<br/>
Where the strait alleys hide me, wall'd between<br/>
High bloomy stalks and rustling banners green;<br/>
The gardens, too, in dazzling hues full-blown,<br/>
With wafted scent and blazing petals strewn;<br/>
The orchards reddening thro' the patient hours,<br/>
While idle autumn in his mossy bowers<br/>
Inviteth meditation to endear<br/>
The sanctuaries of the mellowing year;<br/>
And every spot wherein I loved to stray<br/>
Hath borrowed radiance of eternal day;<br/>
But why am I ever alone, alone?<br/>
Here in the corner of a field my throne,<br/>
Now in the branching chair of some tall tree<br/>
Drinking the gale in bird-like liberty;<br/>
Or to the seashore wandered in the sun<br/>
To watch the fateful waves break one by one;<br/>
Or if on basking downs supine I lie<br/>
Bathing my spirit in blue calms of the sky;<br/>
Or to the river bank am stolen by night<br/>
Hearkening unto the moonlit ripple bright<br/>
That warbles o'er the shallows of smooth stone;<br/>
Why should my memory find me all alone,<br/>
When I had such companions every day<br/>
Jocund and dear? 'Twixt glimpses of their play<br/>
'Tis a vast solitude, wherein I see<br/>
Only myself and what I came to be.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yet never think, dear spirits, if now ye may<br/>
Remember aught of that brief earthly day,<br/>
Ere ye the mournful Stygian river crost,<br/>
From our familiar home too early lost,&mdash;<br/>
O never think that I your tears forget,<br/>
Or that I loved not well, or love not yet.<br/>
Nor ye who held my heart in passion's chain,&mdash;<br/>
As kings and queens succeed in glorious reign&mdash;<br/>
When, as a man, I made you to outvie<br/>
God's work, and, as a god, then set you by<br/>
Among the sainted throng in holiest shrine<br/>
Of mythic creed and poetry divine;<br/>
True was my faith, and still your loves endure,<br/>
The jewels of my fancy, bright and pure.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor only in fair places do I see<br/>
The picture fair now it has ceased to be:<br/>
For fate once led me, and myself some days<br/>
Did I devote, to dull laborious ways,<br/>
By soaring thought detained to tread full low,&mdash;<br/>
Yea might I say unbeauteous paths of woe<br/>
And dreary abodes, had not my youthful sprite<br/>
Hallow'd each nook with legends of delight.<br/>
Ah! o'er that smoky town who looketh now<br/>
By winter sunset from the dark hill-brow,<br/>
Under the dying trees exultantly<br/>
Nursing the sting of human tragedy?<br/>
Or in that little room upstair'd so high,<br/>
Where London's roofs in thickest huddle lie,<br/>
Who now returns at evening to entice<br/>
To his fireside the joys of Paradise?<br/>
Once sacred was that hearth, and bright the air;<br/>
The flame of man's redemption flickered there,<br/>
In worship of those spirits, whose deathless fames<br/>
Have thrilled the stars of heaven to hear their names;<br/>
They that excell'd in wisdom to create<br/>
Beauty, with mortal passion conquering fate;<br/>
And, mid the sovran powers of elder time,<br/>
The loveliness of music and new rhyme,<br/>
The masters young that first enthrall√®d me;<br/>
Of whom if I should name, whom then but thee,<br/>
Sweet Shelley, or the boy whose book was found<br/>
Thrust in thy bosom on thy body drowned?<br/>
</p>
<p>
O mighty Muse, wooer of virgin thought,<br/>
Beside thy charm all else counteth as nought;<br/>
The revelation of thy smile doth make<br/>
Him whom thou lovest reckless for thy sake;<br/>
Earthborn of suffering, that knowest well<br/>
To call thine own, and with enamouring spell<br/>
Feedest the stolen powers of godlike youth<br/>
On dear imagination's only truth,<br/>
Building with song a temple of desire;<br/>
And with the yearning music of thy quire,<br/>
In nuptial sacrament of thought and sense<br/>
Hallowest for toil the hours of indolence:<br/>
Thou in thy melancholic beauty drest,<br/>
Subduest ill to serve thy fair behest,<br/>
With tragic tears, and sevenfold purified<br/>
Silver of mirth; and with extremest pride,<br/>
With secret doctrine and unfathomed lore<br/>
Remainest yet a child for evermore,<br/>
The only enchantress of the earth that art<br/>
To cheer his day and staunch man's bleeding heart.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O heavenly Muse, for heavenly thee we call<br/>
Who in the fire of love refinest all,<br/>
Accurst is he who heark'neth not thy voice;<br/>
But happy he who, numbered of thy choice,<br/>
Walketh aloof from nature's clouded plan:<br/>
For all God's world is but the thought of man;<br/>
Wherein hast thou re-formed a world apart,<br/>
The mutual mirror of his better heart.<br/>
There is no foulness, misery, nor sin,<br/>
But he who loves finds his desire therein,<br/>
And there with thee in lonely commerce lives:<br/>
Nay, all that nature gave or fortune gives,<br/>
Joys that his spirit is most jealous of,<br/>
His only-embraced and best-deserving love,<br/>
Who walketh in the noon of heavenly praise,<br/>
The troubled godhead of his children's gaze,<br/>
Wear thine eternity, and are loved best<br/>
By thee transfigured and in thee possest;<br/>
Who madest beauty, and from thy boundless store<br/>
Of beauty shalt create for evermore.<br/>

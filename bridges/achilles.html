<h1>The Isle of Achilles</h1>
<h2>by Robert Bridges</h2>
<blockquote>
τὸν φίλτατον σοὶ παῖδ᾽ ἐμοί τ᾽ Ἀχιλλέα
ὄψῃ δόμους ναίοντα νησιωτικοὺς
Λευκὴν κατ᾽ ἀκτὴν ἐντὸς ἀξένου πόρου.
&mdash;Euripides, Andromache 1260-1263<br/>
</blockquote>
<p>
Voyaging northwards by the western strand<br/>
Of the Euxine sea we came to where the land<br/>
Sinks low in salt morass and wooded plain:<br/>
Here mighty Ister pushes to the main,<br/>
Forking his turbid flood in channels three<br/>
To plough the sands wherewith he chokes the sea.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Against his middle arm, not many a mile<br/>
In the offing of black water is the isle<br/>
Named of Achilles, or as Leukê known,<br/>
Which tender Thetis, counselling alone<br/>
With her wise sire beneath the ocean-wave<br/>
Unto her child's departed spirit gave,<br/>
Where he might still his love and fame enjoy,<br/>
Through the vain Danaan cause fordone at Troy.<br/>
Thither Achilles passed, and long fulfill'd<br/>
His earthly lot, as the high gods had will'd,<br/>
Far from the rivalries of men, from strife,<br/>
From arms, from woman's love and toil of life.<br/>
Now of his lone abode I will unfold<br/>
What there I saw, or was by others told.<br/>
</p>
<p>
There is in truth a temple on the isle;<br/>
Therein a wooden statue of rude style<br/>
And workmanship antique with helm of lead:<br/>
Else all is desert, uninhabited;<br/>
Only a few goats browse the wind-swept rocks,<br/>
And oft the stragglers of their starving flocks<br/>
Are caught and sacrificed by whomsoe'er,<br/>
Whoever of chance or purpose hither fare:<br/>
About the fence lie strewn their bleaching bones.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But in the temple jewels and precious stones,<br/>
Upheapt with golden rings and vials lie,<br/>
Thankofferings to Achilles, and thereby,<br/>
Written or scratch'd upon the walls in view,<br/>
Inscriptions, with the givers' names thereto,<br/>
Some in Romaic character, some Greek,<br/>
As each man in the tongue that he might speak<br/>
Wrote verse of praise, or prayer for good to come,<br/>
To Achilles most, but to Patroclus some;<br/>
For those who strongly would Achilles move<br/>
Approach him by the pathway of his love.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thousands of birds frequent the sheltering shrine,<br/>
The dippers and the swimmers of the brine,<br/>
Sea-mew and gull and diving cormorant,<br/>
Fishers that on the high cliff make their haunt<br/>
Sheer inaccessible, and sun themselves<br/>
Huddled arow upon the narrow shelves:&mdash;<br/>
And surely no like wonder e'er hath been<br/>
As that such birds should keep the temple clean;<br/>
But thus they do: at earliest dawn of day<br/>
They flock to sea and in the waters play,<br/>
And when they well have wet their plumage light,<br/>
Back to the sanctuary they take flight<br/>
Splashing the walls and columns with fresh brine,<br/>
Till all the stone doth fairly drip and shine,<br/>
When off again they skim asea for more<br/>
And soon returning sprinkle steps and floor,<br/>
And sweep all cleanly with their wide-spread wings.<br/>
</p>
<p>
From other men I have learnt further things.<br/>
If any of free purpose, thus they tell,<br/>
Sail'd hither to consult the oracle,&mdash;<br/>
For oracle there was,&mdash;they sacrificed<br/>
Such victims as they brought, if such sufficed,<br/>
And some they slew, some to the god set free:<br/>
But they who driven from their course at sea<br/>
Chanced on the isle, took of the goats thereon<br/>
And pray'd Achilles to accept his own.<br/>
Then made they a gift, and when they had offer'd once,<br/>
If to their question there was no response,<br/>
They added to the gift and asked again;<br/>
Yea twice and more, until the god should deign<br/>
Answer to give, their offering they renew'd;<br/>
Whereby great riches to the shrine ensued.<br/>
And when both sacrifice and gifts were made<br/>
They worship'd at the shrine, and as they pray'd<br/>
Sailors aver that often hath been seen<br/>
A man like to a god, of warrior mien,<br/>
A beauteous form of figure swift and strong;<br/>
Down on his shoulders his light hair hung long<br/>
And his full armour was enchast with gold:<br/>
While some, who with their eyes might nought behold,<br/>
Say that with music strange the air was stir'd;<br/>
And some there are, who have both seen and heard:<br/>
And if a man wish to be favour'd more,<br/>
He need but spend one night upon the shore;<br/>
To him in sleep Achilles will appear<br/>
And lead him to his tent, and with good cheer<br/>
Show him all friendliness that men desire;<br/>
Patroclus pours the wine, and he his lyre<br/>
Takes from the pole and plays the strains thereon<br/>
Which Cheiron taught him first on Pelion.<br/>
</p>
<p>
These things I tell as they were told to me,<br/>
Nor do I question but it well may be:<br/>
For sure I am that, if man ever was,<br/>
Achilles was a hero, both because<br/>
Of his high birth and beauty, his country's call,<br/>
His valour of soul, his early death withal,<br/>
For Homer's praise, the crown of human art;<br/>
And that above all praise he had at heart<br/>
A gentler passion in her sovran sway,<br/>
And when his love died threw his life away.<br/>

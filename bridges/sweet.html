<h1>"So Sweet Love Seemed That April Morn"</h1>
<h2>by Robert Bridges</h2>
<p>
So sweet love seemed that April morn,<br/>
When first we kissed beside the thorn,<br/>
So strangely sweet, it was not strange<br/>
We thought that love could never change.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But I can tell&mdash;let truth be told&mdash;<br/>
That love will change in growing old;<br/>
Though day by day is nought to see,<br/>
So delicate his motions be.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And in the end 'twill come to pass<br/>
Quite to forget what once he was,<br/>
Nor even in fancy to recall<br/>
The pleasure that was all in all.<br/>
</p>
<p>
His little spring, that sweet we found,<br/>
So deep in summer floods is drowned,<br/>
I wonder, bathed in joy complete,<br/>
How love so young could be so sweet.<br/>

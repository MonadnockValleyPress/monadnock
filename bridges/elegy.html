<h1>Elegy</h1>
<h2>by Robert Bridges</h2>
<p>
The wood is bare: a river-mist is steeping<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees that winter's chill of life bereaves:<br/>
Only their stiffened boughs break silence, weeping<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over their fallen leaves;<br/>
</p>
<p>
That lie upon the dank earth brown and rotten,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Miry and matted in the soaking wet:<br/>
Forgotten with the spring, that is forgotten<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By them that can forget.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yet it was here we walked when ferns were springing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the mossy bank shot bud and blade:-<br/>
Here found in summer, when the birds were singing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A green and pleasant shade.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Twas here we loved in sunnier days and greener;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, in this disconsolate decay,<br/>
I come to see her where I most have seen her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And touch the happier day.<br/>
</p>
<p>
For on this path, at every turn and corner,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fancy of her figure on me falls;<br/>
Yet walks she with the slow step of a mourner,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor hears my voice that calls.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So through my heart there winds a track of feeling,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A path of memory, that is all her own:<br/>
Whereto her phantom beauty ever stealing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haunts the sad spot alone.<br/>
</p>
<p>
About her steps the trunks are bare, the branches<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drip heavy tears upon her downcast head;<br/>
And bleed from unseen wounds that no sun stanches,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year's sun is dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And dead leaves wrap the fruits that summer planted:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And birds that love the South have taken wing.<br/>
The wanderer, loitering o'er the scene enchanted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeps, and despairs of spring.<br/>

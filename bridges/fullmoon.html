<h1>"The Full Moon from Her Cloudless Skies"</h1>
<h2>by Robert Bridges</h2>
<p>
The full moon from her cloudless skies<br/>
Turneth her face, I think, on me;<br/>
And from the hour when she doth rise<br/>
Till when she sets, none else will see.
</p>
<p>
One only other ray she hath,<br/>
That makes an angle close with mine,<br/>
And glancing down its happy path<br/>
Upon another spot doth shine.
</p>
<p>
But that ray too is sent to me,<br/>
For where it lights there dwells my heart:<br/>
And if I were where I would be,<br/>
Both rays would shine, love, where thou art.

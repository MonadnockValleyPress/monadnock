<h1>"I Made Another Song"</h1>
<h2>by Robert Bridges</h2>
<p>
I made another song,<br/>
In likeness of my love:<br/>
And sang it all day long,<br/>
Around, beneath, above;<br/>
I told my secret out,<br/>
That none might be in doubt.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I sang it to the sky,<br/>
That veiled his face to hear<br/>
How far her azure eye<br/>
Outdoes his splendid sphere;<br/>
But at her eyelids' name<br/>
His white clouds fled for shame.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I told it to the trees,<br/>
And to the flowers confest,<br/>
And said not one of these<br/>
Is like my lily drest;<br/>
Nor spathe nor petal dared<br/>
Vie with her body bared.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I shouted to the sea,<br/>
That set his waves a-prance;<br/>
Her floating hair is free,<br/>
Free are her feet to dance;<br/>
And for thy wrath, I swear<br/>
Her frown is more to fear.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And as in happy mood<br/>
I walked and sang alone,<br/>
At eve beside the wood<br/>
I met my love, my own:<br/>
And sang to her the song<br/>
I had sung all day long.<br/>

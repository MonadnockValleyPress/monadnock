<h1>The Garden in September</h1>
<h2>by Robert Bridges</h2>
<p>
Now thin mists temper the slow-ripening beams<br/>
Of the September sun: his golden gleams<br/>
On gaudy flowers shine, that prank the rows<br/>
Of high-grown hollyhocks, and all tall shows<br/>
That Autumn flaunteth in his bushy bowers;<br/>
Where tomtits, hanging from the drooping heads<br/>
Of giant sunflowers, peck the nutty seeds;<br/>
And in the feathery aster bees on wing<br/>
Seize and set free the honied flowers,<br/>
Till thousand stars leap with their visiting:<br/>
While ever across the path mazily flit,<br/>
Unpiloted in the sun,<br/>
The dreamy butterflies<br/>
With dazzling colours powdered and soft glooms,<br/>
White, black and crimson stripes, and peacock eyes,<br/>
Or on chance flowers sit,<br/>
With idle effort plundering one by one<br/>
The nectaries of deepest-throated blooms.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With gentle flaws the western breeze<br/>
Into the garden saileth,<br/>
Scarce here and there stirring the single trees,<br/>
For his sharpness he vaileth:<br/>
So long a comrade of the bearded corn,<br/>
Now from the stubbles whence the shocks are borne,<br/>
O'er dewy lawns he turns to stray,<br/>
As mindful of the kisses and soft play<br/>
Wherewith he enamoured the light-hearted May,<br/>
Ere he deserted her;<br/>
Lover of fragrance, and too late repents;<br/>
Nor more of heavy hyacinth now may drink,<br/>
Nor spicy pink,<br/>
Nor summer's rose, nor garnered lavender,<br/>
But the few lingering scents<br/>
Of streak√®d pea, and gillyflower, and stocks<br/>
Of courtly purple, and aromatic phlox.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And at all times to hear are drowsy tones<br/>
Of dizzy flies, and humming drones,<br/>
With sudden flap of pigeon wings in the sky,<br/>
Or the wild cry<br/>
Of thirsty rooks, that scour ascare<br/>
The distant blue, to watering as they fare<br/>
With creaking pinions, or&mdash;on business bent,<br/>
If aught their ancient polity displease,&mdash;<br/>
Come gathering to their colony, and there<br/>
Settling in ragged parliament,<br/>
Some stormy council hold in the high trees.<br/>

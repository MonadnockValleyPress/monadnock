<h1>Spring</h1>
<h2>by Robert Bridges</h2>
<h3>Ode I: Invitation to the Country</h3>
<p>
Again with pleasant green<br/>
Has Spring renewed the wood,<br/>
And where the bare trunks stood<br/>
Are leafy arbours seen;<br/>
And back on budding boughs<br/>
Come birds, to court and pair,<br/>
Whose rival amorous vows<br/>
Amaze the scented air.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The freshets are unbound,<br/>
And leaping from the hill,<br/>
Their mossy banks refill<br/>
With streams of light and sound:<br/>
And scattered down the meads,<br/>
From hour to hour unfold<br/>
A thousand buds and beads<br/>
In stars and cups of gold.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now hear, and see, and note,<br/>
The farms are all astir,<br/>
And every labourer<br/>
Has doffed his winter coat;<br/>
And how with specks of white<br/>
They dot the brown hillside,<br/>
Or jaunt and sing outright<br/>
As by their teams they stride.<br/>
</p>
<p>
They sing to feel the Sun<br/>
Regain his wanton strength;<br/>
To know the year at length<br/>
Rewards their labour done;<br/>
To see the rootless stake<br/>
They set bare in the ground,<br/>
Burst into leaf, and shake<br/>
Its grateful scent around.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ah now an evil lot<br/>
Is his, who toils for gain,<br/>
Where crowded chimneys stain<br/>
The heavens his choice forgot;<br/>
'Tis on the blighted trees<br/>
That deck his garden dim,<br/>
And in the tainted breeze,<br/>
That sweet Spring comes to him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Far sooner I would choose<br/>
The life of brutes that bask,<br/>
Than set myself a task,<br/>
Which inborn powers refuse:<br/>
And rather far enjoy<br/>
The body, than invent<br/>
A duty, to destroy<br/>
The ease which nature sent;<br/>
</p>
<p>
And country life I praise,<br/>
And lead, because I find<br/>
The philosophic mind<br/>
Can take no middle ways;<br/>
She will not leave her love<br/>
To mix with men, her art<br/>
Is all to strive above<br/>
The crowd, or stand apart.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thrice happy he, the rare<br/>
Prometheus, who can play<br/>
With hidden things, and lay<br/>
New realms of nature bare;<br/>
Whose venturous step has trod<br/>
Hell underfoot, and won<br/>
A crown from man and God<br/>
For all that he has done.&mdash;<br/>
</p>
<p>
That highest gift of all,<br/>
Since crabb√®d fate did flood<br/>
My heart with sluggish blood,<br/>
I look not mine to call;<br/>
But, like a truant freed,<br/>
Fly to the woods, and claim<br/>
A pleasure for the deed<br/>
Of my inglorious name:<br/>
</p>
<p>
And am content, denied<br/>
The best, in choosing right;<br/>
For Nature can delight<br/>
Fancies unoccupied<br/>
With ecstasies so sweet<br/>
As none can even guess,<br/>
Who walk not with the feet<br/>
Of joy in idleness.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then leave your joyless ways,<br/>
My friend, my joys to see.<br/>
The day you come shall be<br/>
The choice of chosen days:<br/>
You shall be lost, and learn<br/>
New being, and forget<br/>
The world, till your return<br/>
Shall bring your first regret.<br/>
</p>
<h3>Ode II: Reply</h3>
<p>
Behold! the radiant Spring,<br/>
In splendour decked anew,<br/>
Down from her heaven of blue<br/>
Returns on sunlit wing:<br/>
The zephyrs of her train<br/>
In fleecy clouds disport,<br/>
And birds to greet her reign<br/>
Summon their silvan court.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And here in street and square<br/>
The prisoned trees contest<br/>
Her favour with the best,<br/>
To robe themselves full fair:<br/>
And forth their buds provoke,<br/>
Forgetting winter brown,<br/>
And all the mire and smoke<br/>
That wrapped the dingy town.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now he that loves indeed<br/>
His pleasure must awake,<br/>
Lest any pleasure take<br/>
Its flight, and he not heed;<br/>
For of his few short years<br/>
Another now invites<br/>
His hungry soul, and cheers<br/>
His life with new delights.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And who loves Nature more<br/>
Than he, whose painful art<br/>
Has taught and skilled his heart<br/>
To read her skill and lore?<br/>
Whose spirit leaps more high,<br/>
Plucking the pale primrose,<br/>
Than his whose feet must fly<br/>
The pasture where it grows?<br/>
</p>
<p>
One long in city pent<br/>
Forgets, or must complain:<br/>
But think not I can stain<br/>
My heaven with discontent;<br/>
Nor wallow with that sad,<br/>
Backsliding herd, who cry<br/>
That Truth must make man bad,<br/>
And pleasure is a lie.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Rather while Reason lives<br/>
To mark me from the beast,<br/>
I'll teach her serve at least<br/>
To heal the wound she gives:<br/>
Nor need she strain her powers<br/>
Beyond a common flight,<br/>
To make the passing hours<br/>
Happy from morn till night.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Since health our toil rewards,<br/>
And strength is labour's prize,<br/>
I hate not, nor despise<br/>
The work my lot accords;<br/>
Nor fret with fears unkind<br/>
The tender joys, that bless<br/>
My hard-won peace of mind,<br/>
In hours of idleness.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then what charm company<br/>
Can give, know I,&mdash;if wine<br/>
Go round, or throats combine<br/>
To set dumb music free.<br/>
Or deep in wintertide<br/>
When winds without make moan,<br/>
I love my own fireside<br/>
Not least when most alone.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then oft I turn the page<br/>
In which our country's name,<br/>
Spoiling the Greek of fame,<br/>
Shall sound in every age:<br/>
Or some Terentian play<br/>
Renew, whose excellent<br/>
Adjusted folds betray<br/>
How once Menander went.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Or if grave study suit<br/>
The yet unwearied brain,<br/>
Plato can teach again,<br/>
And Socrates dispute;<br/>
Till fancy in a dream<br/>
Confront their souls with mine,<br/>
Crowning the mind supreme,<br/>
And her delights divine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While pleasure yet can be<br/>
Pleasant, and fancy sweet,<br/>
I bid all care retreat<br/>
From my philosophy;<br/>
Which, when I come to try<br/>
Your simpler life, will find,<br/>
I doubt not, joys to vie<br/>
With those I leave behind.<br/>

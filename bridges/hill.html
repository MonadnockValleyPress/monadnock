<h1>"There Is a Hill Beside the Silver Thames"</h1>
<h2>by Robert Bridges</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a hill beside the silver Thames,<br/>
Shady with birch and beech and odorous pine:<br/>
And brilliant underfoot with thousand gems<br/>
Steeply the thickets to his floods decline.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight trees in every place<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their thick tops interlace,<br/>
And pendant branches trail their foliage fine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his watery face.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Swift from the sweltering pasturage he flows:<br/>
His stream, alert to seek the pleasant shade,<br/>
Pictures his gentle purpose, as he goes<br/>
Straight to the caverned pool his toil has made.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His winter floods lay bare<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stout roots in the air:<br/>
His summer streams are cool, when they have played<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among their fibrous hair.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A rushy island guards the sacred bower,<br/>
And hides it from the meadow, where in peace<br/>
The lazy cows wrench many a scented flower,<br/>
Robbing the golden market of the bees:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laden barges float<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By banks of myosote;<br/>
And scented flag and golden flower-de-lys<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delay the loitering boat.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And on this side the island, where the pool<br/>
Eddies away, are tangled mass on mass<br/>
The water-weeds, that net the fishes cool,<br/>
And scarce allow a narrow stream to pass;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where spreading crowfoot mars<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drowning nenuphars,<br/>
Waving the tassels of her silken grass<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below her silver stars.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But in the purple pool there nothing grows,<br/>
Not the white water-lily spoked with gold;<br/>
Though best she loves the hollows, and well knows<br/>
On quiet streams her broad shields to unfold:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet should her roots but try<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within these deeps to lie,<br/>
Not her long reaching stalk could ever hold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her waxen head so high.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Sometimes an angler comes, and drops his hook<br/>
Within its hidden depths, and 'gainst a tree<br/>
Leaning his rod, reads in some pleasant book,<br/>
Forgetting soon his pride of fishery;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dreams, or falls asleep,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While curious fishes peep<br/>
About his nibbled bait, or scornfully<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dart off and rise and leap.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And sometimes a slow figure 'neath the trees,<br/>
In ancient-fashioned smock, with tottering care<br/>
Upon a staff propping his weary knees,<br/>
May by the pathway of the forest fare:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from a buried day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the mind will stray<br/>
Some perishing mute shadow,&mdash;and unaware<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He passeth on his way.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Else, he that wishes solitude is safe,<br/>
Whether he bathe at morning in the stream:<br/>
Or lead his love there when the hot hours chafe<br/>
The meadows, busy with a blurring steam;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or watch, as fades the light,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gibbous moon grow bright,<br/>
Until her magic rays dance in a dream,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And glorify the night.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Where is this bower beside the silver Thames?<br/>
O pool and flowery thickets, hear my vow!<br/>
O trees of freshest foliage and straight stems,<br/>
No sharer of my secret I allow:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest ere I come the while<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange feet your shades defile;<br/>
Or lest the burly oarsman turn his prow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within your guardian isle.<br/>

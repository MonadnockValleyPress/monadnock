<h1>"The Lively Lark Stretched Forth Her Wing"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
The lively lark stretched forth her wing,<br/>
The messenger of morning bright,<br/>
And with her cheerful voice did sing<br/>
The day's approach, discharging night,<br/>
When that Aurora, blushing red,<br/>
Descried the guilt of Thetis' bed.
</p>
<p>
I went abroad to take the air,<br/>
And in the meads I met a knight,<br/>
Clad in carnation colour fair;<br/>
I did salute this gentle wight,<br/>
Of him I did his name inquire.<br/>
He sighed, and said he was desire.
</p>
<p>
Desire I did desire to stay,<br/>
Awhile with him I craved to talk;<br/>
The courteous knight said me no nay,<br/>
But hand in hand with me did walk.<br/>
Then of desire I asked again<br/>
What thing did please and what did pain?
</p>
<p>
He smiled, and thus he answered then,<br/>
"Desire can have no greater pain<br/>
"Than for to see another man<br/>
"That he desireth to obtain;<br/>
"Nor greater joy can be than this,<br/>
"Than to enjoy that others miss."

<h1>"If Women Could Be Fair and Yet Not Fond"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
If women could be fair and yet not fond,<br/>
Or that their love were firm, not fickle still,<br/>
I would not marvel that they make men bond<br/>
By service long to purchase their good will.<br/>
But when I see how frail those creatures are,<br/>
I muse that men forget themselves so far.
</p>
<p>
To mark the choice they make and how they change,<br/>
How oft from Phoebus they do flee to Pan;<br/>
Unsettled still, like haggards wild they range,<br/>
These gentle birds that fly from man to man.<br/>
Who would not scorn and shake them from the fist,<br/>
And let them fly, fair fools, which way they list?
</p>
<p>
Yet for disport we fawn and flatter both,<br/>
To pass the time when nothing else can please,<br/>
And train them to our lure with subtle oath,<br/>
Till weary of their wiles ourselves we ease.<br/>
And then we say when we their fancy try,<br/>
To play with fools, oh what a fool was I.

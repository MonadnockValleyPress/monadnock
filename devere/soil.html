<h1>"The Labouring Man That Tills the Fertile Soil"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
The labouring man that tills the fertile soil<br/>
And reaps the harvest fruit hath not indeed<br/>
The gain, but pain, and if for all his toil<br/>
He gets the straw, the Lord will have the seed.
</p>
<p>
The Manchet fine falls not unto his share,<br/>
On coarsest cheat his hungry stomach feeds.<br/>
The Landlord doth possess the finest fare;<br/>
He pulls the flowers, the other plucks but weeds.
</p>
<p>
The mason poor, that builds the Lordly halls,<br/>
Dwells not in them, they are for high degree;<br/>
His Cottage is compact in paper walls,<br/>
And not with brick or stone as others be.
</p>
<p>
The idle Drone that labours not at all<br/>
Sucks up the sweet of honey from the Bee.<br/>
Who worketh most, to their share least doth fall;<br/>
With due desert reward will never be.
</p>
<p>
The swiftest Hare unto the Mastiff slow<br/>
Oft times doth fall to him as for a prey;<br/>
The Greyhound thereby doth miss his game we know<br/>
For which he made such speedy haste away.
</p>
<p>
So he that takes the pain to pen the book<br/>
Reaps not the gifts of goodly golden Muse,<br/>
But those gain that who on the work shall look,<br/>
And from the sour the sweet by skill doth choose.
</p>
<p>
For he that beats the bush the bird not gets,<br/>
But who sits still, and holdeth fast the nets.
</p>

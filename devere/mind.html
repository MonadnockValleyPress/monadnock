<h1>"My Mind to Me a Kingdom Is"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
My mind to me a kingdom is;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such perfect joy therein I find<br/>
That it excels all other bliss<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which God or nature hath assign'd.<br/>
Though much I want that most would have,<br/>
Yet still my mind forbids to crave.
</p>
<p>
No princely port, nor wealthy store,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No force to win a victory,<br/>
No wily wit to salve a sore,<br/>
No shape to win a loving eye;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To none of these I yield as thrall,&mdash;<br/>
For why? my mind despise them all.
</p>
<p>
I see that plenty surfeit oft,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hasty climbers soonest fall;<br/>
I see that such as are aloft<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mishap doth threaten most of all.<br/>
These get with toil and keep with fear;<br/>
Such cares my mind can never bear.
</p>
<p>
I press to bear no haughty sway,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish no more than may suffice,<br/>
I do no more than well I may,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, what I want my mind supplies.<br/>
Lo ! thus I triumph like a king,<br/>
My mind content with anything.
</p>
<p>
I laugh not at another's loss,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor grudge not at another's gain;<br/>
No worldly waves my mind can toss;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brook that is another's bane.<br/>
I fear no foe, nor fawn on friend,<br/>
I loathe not life, nor dread mine end.
</p>
<p>
My wealth is health and perfect ease,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And conscience clear my chief defence;<br/>
I never seek by bribes to please,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor by desert to give offence.<br/>
Thus do I live, thus will I die,&mdash;<br/>
Would all did so as well as I!

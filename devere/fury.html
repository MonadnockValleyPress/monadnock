<h1>"Fain Would I Sing But Fury Makes Me Fret"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
Fain would I sing but fury makes me fret,<br/>
And rage hath sworn to seek revenge of wrong;<br/>
My mazed mind in malice so is set<br/>
As death shall daunt my deadly dolours long.<br/>
Patience perforce is such a pinching pain,<br/>
As die I will or suffer wrong again.
</p>
<p>
I am no sot to suffer such abuse<br/>
As doth bereave my heart of his delight,<br/>
Nor will I frame myself to such as use<br/>
With calm consent to suffer such despite.<br/>
No quiet sleep shall once possess mine eye,<br/>
Till wit have wrought his will on injury.
</p>
<p>
My heart shall fail and hand shall lose his force,<br/>
But some device shall pay despite his due;<br/>
And fury shall consume my careful corse,<br/>
Or raze the ground whereon my sorrow grew.<br/>
Lo, thus in rage of ruthful mind refused,<br/>
I rest revenged of whom I am abused.
</p>

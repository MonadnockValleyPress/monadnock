<h1>"A Crown of Bays"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
A Crown of Bays shall that man wear<br/>
That triumphs over me,<br/>
For Black and Tawny will I wear,<br/>
Which mourning colours be.
</p>
<p>
The more I followed on, the more she fled away,<br/>
As Daphne did full long agone, Apollo's wishful prey;<br/>
The more my plaints resound, the less she pities me;<br/>
The more I sought, the less I found that mine she meant to be.
</p>
<p>
Melpomene, alas, with doleful tunes help then,<br/>
And sing, and sing, woe worth on me, forsaken man.<br/>
Then Daphne's Bays shall that man wear that triumphs over me,<br/>
For Black and Tawny will I wear, which mourning colours be.
</p>
<p>
Drown me you trickling tears, you wailful wights of woe;<br/>
Come help these hands to rent my hairs, my rueful haps to show<br/>
On whom the scorching flames of love doth feed you see;<br/>
Ah lá–lantí–da, my dear dame hath thus tormented me.
</p>
<p>
Wherefore you Muses nine, with doleful tunes help then,<br/>
And sing, and sing, woe worth on me, forsaken man.<br/>
Then Daphne's Bays shall that man wear that triumphs over me,<br/>
For Black and Tawny will I wear, which mourning colours be.
</p>
<p>
An Anchor's life to lead, with nails to scratch my grave,<br/>
Where earthly Worms on me shall feed, is all the joys I crave,<br/>
And hide myself from shame, sith that mine eyes do see,<br/>
Ah lá–lantí–da, my dear dame hath thus tormented me.
</p>
<p>
And all that present be, with doleful tunes help then,<br/>
And sing, and sing, woe worth on me, forsaken man.

<h1>"Winged With Desire"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
Winged with desire, I seek to mount on high,<br/>
Clogged with mishap yet am I kept full low;<br/>
Who seeks to live and finds the way to die,<br/>
Sith comfort ebbs, and cares do daily flow,<br/>
But sad despair would have me to retire,<br/>
When smiling hope sets forward my desire.
</p>
<p>
I still do toil and never am at rest,<br/>
Enjoying least when I do covet most;<br/>
With weary thoughts are my green years oppressed,<br/>
To danger drawn from my desired coast;<br/>
Now crazed with Care, then halèd up with Hope,<br/>
With world at will yet wanting wishèd scope.
</p>
<p>
I like in heart, yet dare not say I love,<br/>
And looks alone do lend me chief relief.<br/>
I dwelt sometimes at rest yet must remove,<br/>
With feignèd joy I hide my secret grief.<br/>
I would possess yet needs must flee the place<br/>
Where I do seek to win my chiefest grace.
</p>
<p>
Lo, thus I live twixt fear and comfort tossed,<br/>
With least abode where best I feel content;<br/>
I seld resort where I should settle most,<br/>
My sliding times too soon with her are spent;<br/>
I hover high and soar where Hope doth tower,<br/>
Yet froward Fate defers my happy hour.
</p>
<p>
I live abroad but still in secret grief,<br/>
Then least alone when most I seem to lurk;<br/>
I speak of peace, and live in endless strife,<br/>
And when I play then are my thoughts at work;<br/>
In person far that am in mind full near,<br/>
Making light show where I esteem most dear.
</p>
<p>
A malcontent yet seem I pleasèd still,<br/>
Bragging of heaven yet feeling pains of hell.<br/>
But Time shall frame a time unto my will,<br/>
Whenas in sport this earnest will I tell;<br/>
Till then, sweet friend, abide these storms with me,<br/>
Which shall in joys of either fortunes be.

<h1>"I Am Not as I Seem to Be"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
I am not as I seem to be,<br/>
Nor when I smile I am not glad,<br/>
A thrall although you count me free<br/>
I, most in mirth, most pensive-sad;<br/>
I smile to shade my bitter spite,<br/>
As Hannibal, that saw in sight<br/>
His country soil, with Carthage town,<br/>
By Roman force defacèd down.
</p>
<p>
And Caesar, that presented was<br/>
With noble Pompey's princely head,<br/>
As 'twere some judge to rule the case,<br/>
A flood of tears he seemed to shed;<br/>
Although indeed it sprung of joy,<br/>
Yet others thought it was annoy;<br/>
Thus contraries be used, I find,<br/>
Of wise to cloak the covert mind.
</p>
<p>
I Hannibal, that smiles for grief,<br/>
And let you Caesar's tears suffice,<br/>
The one that laughs at his mischief,<br/>
The other all for joy that cries;<br/>
I smile to see me scornèd so,<br/>
You weep for joy to see me woe,<br/>
And I a heart by love slain dead<br/>
Presents, in place of Pompey's head.
</p>
<p>
O cruel hap and hard estate<br/>
That forceth me to love my foe,<br/>
Accursèd by so foul a fate<br/>
My choice for to prefix it so,<br/>
So long to fight with secret sore,<br/>
And find no secret salve therefor;<br/>
Some purge their pain by plaint, I find,<br/>
But I in vain do breathe my wind.

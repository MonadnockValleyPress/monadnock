<h1>"The Trickling Tears That Fall Along My Cheeks"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
The trickling tears that fall along my cheeks,<br/>
The secret sighs that show my inward grief,<br/>
The present pains perforce that love ay seeks,<br/>
Bid me renew my cares without relief<br/>
In woeful song, in dole display,<br/>
My pensive heart for to bewray.
</p>
<p>
Bewray thy grief, thou woeful heart, with speed,<br/>
Resign thy voice to her that caused thy woe;<br/>
With irksome cries bewail thy late-done deed,<br/>
For she thou lovest is sure thy mortal foe,<br/>
And help for thee there is none sure,<br/>
But still in pain thou must endure.
</p>
<p>
The stricken Deer hath help to heal his wound,<br/>
The haggard hawk with toil is made full tame,<br/>
The strongest tower the Cannon lays on ground,<br/>
The wisest wit that ever had the fame<br/>
Was thrall to Love by Cupid's sleights;<br/>
Then weigh my case with equal weights.
</p>
<p>
She is my joy, she is my care and woe,<br/>
She is my pain, she is my ease therefor,<br/>
She is my death, she is my life also,<br/>
She is my salve, she is my wounded sore;<br/>
In fine, she hath the hand and knife<br/>
That may both save and end my life.
</p>
<p>
And shall I live on earth to be her thrall?<br/>
And shall I sue and serve her all in vain?<br/>
And shall I kiss the steps that she lets fall?<br/>
And shall I pray the gods to keep the pain<br/>
From her, that is so cruel still?<br/>
No, no, on her work all your will.
</p>
<p>
And let her feel the power of all your might,<br/>
And let her have her most desire with speed,<br/>
And let her pine away both day and night,<br/>
And let her moan, and none lament her need,<br/>
And let all those that shall her see<br/>
Despise her state, and pity me.

<h1>"Sitting Alone Upon My Thought"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
Sitting alone upon my thought, in melancholy mood,<br/>
In sight of sea, and at my back an ancient hoary wood,<br/>
I saw a fair young lady come, her secret fears to wail,<br/>
Clad all in colour of a nun, and covered with a veil.<br/>
Yet, for the day was clear and calm, I might discern her face,<br/>
As one might see a damask rose hid under crystal glass.<br/>
Three times with her soft hand full hard on her left side she knocks,<br/>
And sighed so sore as might have moved some pity in the rocks.<br/>
From sighs, and shedding amber tears, into sweet song she brake,<br/>
When thus the echo answered her to every word she spake.
</p>
<p>
"O heavens, who was the first that bred in me this fever?" Vere.<br/>
"Who was the first that gave the wound, whose scar I wear for ever?" Vere.<br/>
"What tyrant Cupid to my harms usurps the golden quiver?" Vere.<br/>
"What wight first caught this heart, and can from bondage it deliver?" Vere.<br/>
"Yet who doth most adore this wight, O hollow caves, tell true?" You.<br/>
"What nymph deserves his liking best, yet doth in sorrow rue?" You.<br/>
"What makes him not regard good will with some remorse or ruth?" Youth.<br/>
"What makes him show, besides his birth, such pride and such untruth?" Youth.<br/>
"May I his beauty match with love, if he my love will try?" Aye.<br/>
"May I requite his birth with faith? Then faithful will I die?" Aye.
</p>
<p>
And I, that knew this lady well,<br/>
Said Lord, how great a miracle,<br/>
To hear how echo told the truth,<br/>
As true as Phoebus' oracle.

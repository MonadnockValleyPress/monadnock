<h1>"My Meaning Is to Work What Wonders Love Hath Wrought"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
My meaning is to work what wonders love hath wrought,<br/>
Wherewith I muse why men of wit have love so dearly bought;<br/>
For love is worse than hate, and eke more harm hath done:<br/>
Record I take of those that rede of Paris, Priam's son.
</p>
<p>
It seemed the God of sleep had mazed so much his wits<br/>
When he refus√®d wit for love, which cometh but by fits;<br/>
But why accuse I him, whom earth hath covered long?<br/>
There be of his posterity alive, I do him wrong.
</p>
<p>
Whom I might well condemn to be a cruel judge<br/>
Unto myself, who hath the crime in others that I grudge.
</p>

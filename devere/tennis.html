<h1>"Whereas the Heart at Tennis Plays"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
Whereas the heart at tennis plays, and men to gaming fall,<br/>
Love is the court, hope is the house, and favour serves the ball.<br/>
The ball itself is true desert; the line, which measure shows,<br/>
Is reason, whereon judgment looks how players win or lose.<br/>
The jetty is deceitful guile, the stopper, jealousy,<br/>
Which hath Sir Argus' hundred eyes wherewith to watch and pry.<br/>
The fault, wherewith fifteen is lost, is want of wit and sense,<br/>
And he that brings the racket in is double diligence.<br/>
And lo, the racket is freewill, which makes the ball rebound;<br/>
And noble beauty is the chase, of every game the ground.<br/>
But rashness strikes the ball awry, and where is oversight?<br/>
"A bandy ho," the people cry, and so the ball takes flight.<br/>
Now in the end, good-liking proves content the game and gain.<br/>
Thus in a tennis knit I love, a pleasure mixed with pain.

<h1>"Framed in the Front of Forlorn Hope"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
Framed in the front of forlorn hope, past all recovery,<br/>
I stayless stand t'abide the shock of shame and infamy.<br/>
My life, through lingering long, is lodged in lair of loathsome ways,<br/>
My death delayed to keep from life the harm of hapless days.<br/>
My sprites, my heart, my wit and force in deep distress are drowned;<br/>
The only loss of my good name is of these griefs the ground.
</p>
<p>
And since my mind, my wit, my head, my voice and tongue are weak<br/>
To utter, move, devise, conceive, sound forth, declare and speak<br/>
Such piercing plaints as answer might, or would, my woeful case,<br/>
Help crave I must, and crave I will, with tears upon my face<br/>
Of all that may in heaven or hell, in earth or air, be found<br/>
To wail with me this loss of mine, as of these griefs the ground.
</p>
<p>
Help gods, help saints, help sprites and powers that in the heaven do dwell,<br/>
Help ye that are to wail, ay wont, ye howling hounds of hell,<br/>
Help man, help beasts, help birds and worms that on the earth doth toil,<br/>
Help fish, help fowl that flocks and feeds upon the salt sea soil,<br/>
Help echo that in air doth flee, shrill voices to resound<br/>
To wail this loss of my good name, as of these griefs the ground.

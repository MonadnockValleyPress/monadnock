<h1>"Who Taught Thee First to Sigh?"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
Who taught thee first to sigh, alas, my heart?<br/>
Who taught thy tongue the woeful words of plaint?<br/>
Who filled thine eyes with tears of bitter smart?<br/>
Who gave thee grief and made thy joys so faint?
</p>
<p>
Who first did print with colours pale thy face?<br/>
Who first did break thy sleeps of quiet rest?<br/>
Above the rest in Court, who gave thee Grace?<br/>
Who made thee strive in virtue to be best?
</p>
<p>
In constant troth to bide so firm and sure,<br/>
To scorn the world, regarding but thy friend,<br/>
With patient mind each passion to endure,<br/>
In one desire to settle to thy end?
</p>
<p>
Love then thy choice, wherein such faith doth bind,<br/>
As nought but death may ever change thy mind.
</p>

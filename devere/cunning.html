<h1>"What Cunning Can Express"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
What cunning can express<br/>
The favour of her face,<br/>
To whom in this distress<br/>
I do appeal for grace?<br/>
A thousand Cupids fly<br/>
About her gentle eye.
</p>
<p>
From whence each throws a dart,<br/>
That kindleth soft sweet fire,<br/>
Within my sighing heart,<br/>
Possessed by desire;<br/>
No sweeter life I try,<br/>
Than in her love to die.
</p>
<p>
The Lily in the field,<br/>
That glories in his white,<br/>
For pureness now must yield<br/>
And render up his right;<br/>
Heaven pictured in her face<br/>
Doth promise joy and grace.
</p>
<p>
Fair Cynthia's silver light,<br/>
That beats on running streams,<br/>
Compares not with her white,<br/>
Whose hairs are all sunbeams;<br/>
Her virtues so do shine,<br/>
As day unto mine eyne.
</p>
<p>
With this there is a Red<br/>
Exceeds the Damask Rose,<br/>
Which in her cheeks is spread,<br/>
Whence every favour grows;<br/>
In sky there is no star<br/>
That she surmounts not far.
</p>
<p>
When Phoebus from the bed<br/>
Of Thetis doth arise,<br/>
The morning, blushing red,<br/>
In fair carnation wise,<br/>
He shows it in her face<br/>
As Queen of every grace.
</p>
<p>
This pleasant Lily white,<br/>
This taint of roseate red,<br/>
This Cynthia's silver light,<br/>
This sweet fair Dea spread,<br/>
These sunbeams in mine eye,<br/>
These beauties make me die.

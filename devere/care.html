<h1>"If Care or Skill Could Conquer Vain Desire"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
If care or skill could conquer vain desire,<br/>
Or reason's reins my strong affection stay,<br/>
Then should my sighs to quiet breast retire,<br/>
And shun such signs as secret thoughts bewray;<br/>
Uncomely love, which now lurks in my breast,<br/>
Should cease my grief, through wisdom's power oppressed.
</p>
<p>
But who can leave to look on Venus' face,<br/>
Or yieldeth not to Juno's high estate?<br/>
What wit so wise as gives not Pallas place?<br/>
These virtues rare each God did yield a mate,<br/>
Save her alone who yet on earth doth reign,<br/>
Whose beauty's string no Gods can well distrain.
</p>
<p>
What worldly wight can hope for heavenly hire<br/>
When only sighs must make his secret moan?<br/>
A silent suit doth seld to Grace aspire;<br/>
My hapless hap doth roll the restless stone;<br/>
Yet Phoebe fair disdained the heavens above,<br/>
To joy on earth her poor Endymion's love.
</p>
<p>
Rare is reward where none can justly crave,<br/>
For chance is choice where reason makes no claim;<br/>
Yet luck sometimes despairing souls doth save:<br/>
A happy star made Gyges joy attain;<br/>
A slavish smith of rude and rascal race<br/>
Found means in time to gain a Goddess' grace.
</p>
<p>
Then lofty Love thy sacred sails advance;<br/>
My seething seas shall flow with streams of tears.<br/>
Amidst disdain drive forth my doleful chance;<br/>
A valiant mind no deadly danger fears.<br/>
Who loves aloft and sets his heart on high,<br/>
Deserves no pain, though he do pine and die.

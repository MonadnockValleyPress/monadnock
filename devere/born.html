<h1>"When Wert Thou Born, Desire?"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
When wert thou born, desire?<br/>
In pomp and prime of May.<br/>
By whom, sweet boy, wert thou begot?<br/>
By good conceit, men say.<br/>
Tell me, who was thy nurse?<br/>
Fresh youth in sugared joy.<br/>
What was thy meat and daily food?<br/>
Sad sighs with great annoy.<br/>
What hadst thou then to drink?<br/>
Unfeigned lovers' tears.<br/>
What cradle wert thou rocked in?<br/>
In hope devoid of fears.<br/>
What brought thee then asleep?<br/>
Sweet speech, that liked me best.<br/>
And where is now thy dwelling-place?<br/>
In gentle hearts I rest.<br/>
Doth company displease?<br/>
It doth in many a one.<br/>
Where would desire then choose to be?<br/>
He likes to muse alone.<br/>
What feedeth most your sight?<br/>
To gaze on favour still.<br/>
What findest thou most to be thy foe?<br/>
Disdain of my goodwill.<br/>
Will ever age or death<br/>
Bring thee unto decay?<br/>
No, no, desire both lives and dies<br/>
Ten thousand times a day.

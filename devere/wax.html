<h1>"Even as the Wax Doth Melt"</h1>
<h2>by Edward de Vere</h2>
<p>
Even as the wax doth melt, or dew consume away<br/>
Before the Sun, so I behold, through careful thoughts decay,<br/>
For my best luck leads me to such sinister state<br/>
That I do waste with others' love, that hath myself in hate,<br/>
And he that beats the bush, the wished bird not gets,<br/>
But such I see as sitteth still, and holds the fowling nets.
</p>
<p>
The Drone more honey sucks, that laboureth not at all,<br/>
Than doth the Bee, to whose most pain least pleasure doth befall;<br/>
The Gardener sows the seeds whereof the flowers do grow,<br/>
And others yet do gather them that took less pain, I know;<br/>
So I the pleasant grape have pulled from the Vine,<br/>
And yet I languish in great thirst while others drink the wine.
</p>
<p>
Thus like a woeful wight I wove my web of woe;<br/>
The more I would weed out my cares, the more they seem to grow.<br/>
The which betokeneth hope, forsaken is of me,<br/>
That with the careful culver climbs the worn and withered tree<br/>
To entertain my thoughts, and there my hap to moan,<br/>
That never am less idle, lo, than when I am alone.

<h1>The Death of Lincoln</h1>
<h2>by Henrik Ibsen (1865)</h2>
<h3>translated by William Schofield (1909)</h3>
<p>
They fired a shot over you in the West,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Europe awakened from sleep;<br/>
Lo, 'mongst the courtiers, silken-dressed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Deadly alarums creep.<br/>
Old Europe, thou with order and law,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With maxims that never fail,<br/>
With a name unstained by blemish or flaw,<br/>
With virtuous wrath that holds in awe, &mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then grewest thou strangely pale!
</p>
<p>
In mourning is stamped the unicorn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The eagle, each nation's seal;<br/>
Swift packets over the sea are borne;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Despatches the truth reveal.<br/>
The cotton-monarchs, men of fame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In hosts from the land of lies,<br/>
The branch of peace to gather, came &mdash;<br/>
With a single pistol's crack and flame<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He falls &mdash; the One Man dies!
</p>
<p>
And so ye sages of Europe took fright!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why at this grieve ye the more?<br/>
A Prussian deed, the Düppelers' slight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The world had witnessed before.<br/>
No raven hath ever his brother slain &mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Poland come into your mind?<br/>
Or at Copenhagen the English gain?<br/>
Or the Flensburg grave? Or Sönderburg's bane?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What anger now do ye find?
</p>
<p>
The ruddy flower that yonder glows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And startles you with its gloom,<br/>
Is only the graft of our Europe-rose,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In richer earth a-bloom.<br/>
You planted this scion of your land,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That reddens the soil of the West;<br/>
'Tis you who with your very own hand<br/>
Have bound the blood-stained martyrs' band<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On Abraham Lincoln's breast.
</p>
<p>
With vows forgotten and oaths insincere,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With sheaves of treaties unsound,<br/>
With promises broken from year to year,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye have fertilized history's ground.<br/>
And now, even now, ye expect it to bear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A crop of the noblest strain.<br/>
Lo, your seed is grown! At a ruddy flare<br/>
Ye marvel, beholding everywhere<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A harvest of daggers for grain!
</p>
<p>
Where law abides at the point of the knife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And justice the gallows can sway,<br/>
Is nearer and surer the dawn of new life<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than here where with words ye slay.<br/>
A Will is awaking and bringing its doom<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To hurl down the fabric of lies;<br/>
But the worm must first eat his way in the tomb,<br/>
And Time must other garments assume<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till in caricature he dies.
</p>
<p>
There ruleth a Spirit, eternally just,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose power ye cannot gainsay;<br/>
He bade Domus Aurea lie in the dust<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nero's colossus decay.<br/>
But first had the vices of Rome to go<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the earth from pole to pole,<br/>
And tyrants be deified here below,<br/>
And emperors' golden statues glow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like gods on the Capitol.
</p>
<p>
They crumbled together, both circus and hall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Temples and columns fell low;<br/>
Arcades and arches were trampled small<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the hoofs of the buffalo.<br/>
Men builded anew on the old, old ground,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And clean was the air for a time;<br/>
But the new life in turn its warning hath found;<br/>
Now rises the pest, from the swamp unbound,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And is wafted from clime to clime.
</p>
<p>
But although in the swamp of corruption we go,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I cry not "Woe is me,"<br/>
For the poison-flowers that flaunting grow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In clusters on Time's fair tree.<br/>
Let the worm gnaw on till the shell is bare,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor roof nor wall shall decay;<br/>
Let the "system" on to its ruin fare,<br/>
The sooner will vengeance its doom prepare,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On Hypocrisy's latest day!

<h1>Memorabilia</h1>
<h2>by Xenophon</h2>
<h3>Book III, Chapter 13</h3>
<p>Once when some one was in a fury of indignation because he had bidden a passer-by good-day and the salutation was not returned, Socrates said: "It is enough to make one laugh! If you met a man in a wretched condition of body, you would not fall into a rage; but because you stumble upon a poor soul somewhat boorishly disposed, you feel annoyed."</p>
<p>To the remark of another who complained that he did not take his food with pleasure, he said: "Acumenus has a good prescription for that." And when the other asked: "And what may that be?" "To stop eating," he said. "On the score of pleasure, economy, and health, total abstinence has much in its favour."</p>
<p>And when some one else lamented that "the drinking-water in his house was hot," he replied: "Then when you want a warm bath you will not have to wait."</p>
<p>The Other. But for bathing purposes it is cold.</p>
<p>Soc. Do you find that your domestics seem to mind drinking it or washing in it?</p>
<p>The Other. Quite the reverse; it is a constant marvel to me how contentedly they use it for either purpose.</p>
<p>Soc. Which is hotter to the taste &mdash; the water in your house or the hot spring in the temple of Asclepius?</p>
<p>The Other. The water in the temple of Asclepius.</p>
<p>Soc. And which is colder for bathing &mdash; yours or the cold spring in the cave of Amphiaraus?</p>
<p>The Other. The water in the cave of Amphiaraus.</p>
<p>Soc. Then please to observe: if you do not take care, they will set you down as harder to please than a domestic servant or an invalid.</p>
<p>A man had administered a severe whipping to the slave in attendance on him, and when Socrates asked: "Why he was so wroth with his own serving-man?" excused himself on the ground that "the fellow was a lazy, gourmandising, good-for-nothing dolt &mdash; fonder of money than of work." To which Socrates: "Did it ever strike you to consider which of the two in that case the more deserves a whipping &mdash; the master or the man?"</p>
<p>When some one was apprehending the journey to Olympia, "Why are you afraid of the long distance?" he asked. "Here at home you spend nearly all your day in taking walks. Well, on your road to Olympia you will take a walk and breakfast, and then you will take another walk and dine, and go to bed. Do you not see, if you take and tack together five or six days' length of walks, and stretch them out in one long line, it will soon reach from Athens to Olympia? I would recommend you, however, to set off a day too soon rather than a day too late. To be forced to lengthen the day's journey beyond a reasonable amount may well be a nuisance; but to take one day's journey beyond what is necessary is pure relaxation. Make haste to start, I say, and not while on the road."</p>
<p>When some one else remarked "he was utterly prostrated after a long journey," Socrates asked him: "Had he had any baggage to carry?"</p>
<p>"Not I," replied the complainer; "only my cloak."</p>
<p>Soc. Were you travelling alone, or was your man-servant with you?</p>
<p>He. Yes, I had my man.</p>
<p>Soc. Empty-handed, or had he something to carry?</p>
<p>He. Of course; carrying my rugs and other baggage.</p>
<p>Soc. And how did he come off on the journey?</p>
<p>He. Better than I did myself, I take it.</p>
<p>Soc. Well, but now suppose you had had to carry his baggage, what would your condition have been like?</p>
<p>He. Sorry enough, I can tell you; or rather, I could not have carried it at all.</p>
<p>Soc. What a confession! Fancy being capable of so much less toil than a poor slave boy! Does that sound like the perfection of athletic training?</p>
<p>XIV</p>
<p>On the occasion of a common dinner-party where some of the company would present themselves with a small, and others with a large supply of viands, Socrates would bid the servants throw the small supplies into the general stock, or else to help each of the party to a share all round. Thus the grand victuallers were ashamed in the one case not to share in the common stock, and in the other not to throw in their supplies also. Accordingly in went the grand supplies into the common stock. And now, being no better off than the small contributors, they soon ceased to cater for expensive delicacies.</p>
<p>At a supper-party one member of the company, as Socrates chanced to note, had put aside the plain fare and was devoting himself to certain dainties. A discussion was going on about names and definitions, and the proper applications of terms to things. Whereupon Socrates, appealing to the company: "Can we explain why we call a man a 'dainty fellow'? What is the particular action to which the term applies?  &mdash; since every one adds some dainty to his food when he can get it. But we have not quite hit the definition yet, I think. Are we to be called dainty eaters because we like our bread buttered?"</p>
<p>No! hardly! (some member of the company replied).</p>
<p>Soc. Well, but now suppose a man confine himself to eating venison or other dainty without any plain food at all, not as a matter of training, but for the pleasure of it: has such a man earned the title? "The rest of the world would have a poor chance against him," some one answered. "Or," interposed another, "what if the dainty dishes he devours are out of all proportion to the rest of his meal &mdash; what of him?"</p>
<p>Soc. He has established a very fair title at any rate to the appellation, and when the rest of the world pray to heaven for a fine harvest: "May our corn and oil increase!" he may reasonably ejaculate, "May my fleshpots multiply!"</p>
<p>At this last sally the young man, feeling that the conversation set somewhat in his direction, did not desist indeed from his savoury viands, but helped himself generously to a piece of bread. Socrates was all-observant, and added: Keep an eye on our friend yonder, you others next him, and see fair play between the sop and the sauce.</p>
<p>Another time, seeing one of the company using but one sop of bread to test several savoury dishes, he remarked: Could there be a more extravagant style of cookery, or more murderous to the dainty dishes themselves, than this wholesale method of taking so many dishes together? &mdash; why, bless me, twenty different sorts of seasoning at one swoop! First of all he mixes up actually more ingredients than the cook himself prescribes, which is extravagant; and secondly, he has the audacity to commingle what the chef holds incongruous, whereby if the cooks are right in their method he is wrong in his, and consequently the destroyer of their art. Now is it not ridiculous first to procure the greatest virtuosi to cook for us, and then without any claim to their skill to take and alter their procedure? But there is a worse thing in store for the bold man who habituates himself to eat a dozen dishes at once: when there are but few dishes served, out of pure habit he will feel himself half starved, whilst his neighbour, accustomed to send his sop down by help of a single relish, will feast merrily, be the dishes never so few.</p>
<p>He had a saying that {euokheisthai}, to "make good cheer," was in Attic parlance a synonym for "eating," and the affix {eu} (the attributive "good") connoted the eating of such things as would not trouble soul or body, and were not far to seek or hard to find. So that to "make good cheer" in his vocabulary applied to a modest and well-ordered style of living.</p>

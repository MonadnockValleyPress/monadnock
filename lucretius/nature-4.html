<h1>The Nature of Things</h1>
<h2>by Lucretius</h2>
<h3>Book IV</h3>
<p>
I wander afield, thriving in sturdy thought,<br/>
Through unpathed haunts of the Pierides,<br/>
Trodden by step of none before. I joy<br/>
To come on undefiled fountains there,<br/>
To drain them deep; I joy to pluck new flowers,<br/>
To seek for this my head a signal crown<br/>
From regions where the Muses never yet<br/>
Have garlanded the temples of a man:<br/>
First, since I teach concerning mighty things,<br/>
And go right on to loose from round the mind<br/>
The tightened coils of dread religion;<br/>
Next, since, concerning themes so dark, I frame<br/>
Song so pellucid, touching all throughout<br/>
Even with the Muses' charm&mdash;which, as 'twould seem,<br/>
Is not without a reasonable ground:<br/>
For as physicians, when they seek to give<br/>
Young boys the nauseous wormwood, first do touch<br/>
The brim around the cup with the sweet juice<br/>
And yellow of the honey, in order that<br/>
The thoughtless age of boyhood be cajoled<br/>
As far as the lips, and meanwhile swallow down<br/>
The wormwood's bitter draught, and, though befooled,<br/>
Be yet not merely duped, but rather thus<br/>
Grow strong again with recreated health:<br/>
So now I too (since this my doctrine seems<br/>
In general somewhat woeful unto those<br/>
Who've had it not in hand, and since the crowd<br/>
Starts back from it in horror) have desired<br/>
To expound our doctrine unto thee in song<br/>
Soft-speaking and Pierian, and, as 'twere,<br/>
To touch it with sweet honey of the Muse&mdash;<br/>
If by such method haply I might hold<br/>
The mind of thee upon these lines of ours,<br/>
Till thou dost learn the nature of all things<br/>
And understandest their utility.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But since I've taught already of what sort<br/>
The seeds of all things are, and how distinct<br/>
In divers forms they flit of own accord,<br/>
Stirred with a motion everlasting on,<br/>
And in what mode things be from them create,<br/>
And since I've taught what the mind's nature is,<br/>
And of what things 'tis with the body knit<br/>
And thrives in strength, and by what mode uptorn<br/>
That mind returns to its primordials,<br/>
Now will I undertake an argument&mdash;<br/>
One for these matters of supreme concern&mdash;<br/>
That there exist those somewhats which we call<br/>
The images of things: these, like to films<br/>
Scaled off the utmost outside of the things,<br/>
Flit hither and thither through the atmosphere,<br/>
And the same terrify our intellects,<br/>
Coming upon us waking or in sleep,<br/>
When oft we peer at wonderful strange shapes<br/>
And images of people lorn of light,<br/>
Which oft have horribly roused us when we lay<br/>
In slumber&mdash;that haply nevermore may we<br/>
Suppose that souls get loose from Acheron,<br/>
Or shades go floating in among the living,<br/>
Or aught of us is left behind at death,<br/>
When body and mind, destroyed together, each<br/>
Back to its own primordials goes away.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And thus I say that effigies of things,<br/>
And tenuous shapes from off the things are sent,<br/>
From off the utmost outside of the things,<br/>
Which are like films or may be named a rind,<br/>
Because the image bears like look and form<br/>
With whatso body has shed it fluttering forth&mdash;<br/>
A fact thou mayst, however dull thy wits,<br/>
Well learn from this: mainly, because we see<br/>
Even 'mongst visible objects many be<br/>
That send forth bodies, loosely some diffused&mdash;<br/>
Like smoke from oaken logs and heat from fires&mdash;<br/>
And some more interwoven and condensed&mdash;<br/>
As when the locusts in the summertime<br/>
Put off their glossy tunics, or when calves<br/>
At birth drop membranes from their body's surface,<br/>
Or when, again, the slippery serpent doffs<br/>
Its vestments 'mongst the thorns&mdash;for oft we see<br/>
The breres augmented with their flying spoils:<br/>
Since such takes place, 'tis likewise certain too<br/>
That tenuous images from things are sent,<br/>
From off the utmost outside of the things.<br/>
For why those kinds should drop and part from things,<br/>
Rather than others tenuous and thin,<br/>
No power has man to open mouth to tell;<br/>
Especially, since on outsides of things<br/>
Are bodies many and minute which could,<br/>
In the same order which they had before,<br/>
And with the figure of their form preserved,<br/>
Be thrown abroad, and much more swiftly too,<br/>
Being less subject to impediments,<br/>
As few in number and placed along the front.<br/>
For truly many things we see discharge<br/>
Their stuff at large, not only from their cores<br/>
Deep-set within, as we have said above,<br/>
But from their surfaces at times no less&mdash;<br/>
Their very colours too. And commonly<br/>
The awnings, saffron, red and dusky blue,<br/>
Stretched overhead in mighty theatres,<br/>
Upon their poles and cross-beams fluttering,<br/>
Have such an action quite; for there they dye<br/>
And make to undulate with their every hue<br/>
The circled throng below, and all the stage,<br/>
And rich attire in the patrician seats.<br/>
And ever the more the theatre's dark walls<br/>
Around them shut, the more all things within<br/>
Laugh in the bright suffusion of strange glints,<br/>
The daylight being withdrawn. And therefore, since<br/>
The canvas hangings thus discharge their dye<br/>
From off their surface, things in general must<br/>
Likewise their tenuous effigies discharge,<br/>
Because in either case they are off-thrown<br/>
From off the surface. So there are indeed<br/>
Such certain prints and vestiges of forms<br/>
Which flit around, of subtlest texture made,<br/>
Invisible, when separate, each and one.<br/>
Again, all odour, smoke, and heat, and such<br/>
Streams out of things diffusedly, because,<br/>
Whilst coming from the deeps of body forth<br/>
And rising out, along their bending path<br/>
They're torn asunder, nor have gateways straight<br/>
Wherethrough to mass themselves and struggle abroad.<br/>
But contrariwise, when such a tenuous film<br/>
Of outside colour is thrown off, there's naught<br/>
Can rend it, since 'tis placed along the front<br/>
Ready to hand. Lastly those images<br/>
Which to our eyes in mirrors do appear,<br/>
In water, or in any shining surface,<br/>
Must be, since furnished with like look of things,<br/>
Fashioned from images of things sent out.<br/>
There are, then, tenuous effigies of forms,<br/>
Like unto them, which no one can divine<br/>
When taken singly, which do yet give back,<br/>
When by continued and recurrent discharge<br/>
Expelled, a picture from the mirrors' plane.<br/>
Nor otherwise, it seems, can they be kept<br/>
So well conserved that thus be given back<br/>
Figures so like each object.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now then, learn<br/>
How tenuous is the nature of an image.<br/>
And in the first place, since primordials be<br/>
So far beneath our senses, and much less<br/>
E'en than those objects which begin to grow<br/>
Too small for eyes to note, learn now in few<br/>
How nice are the beginnings of all things&mdash;<br/>
That this, too, I may yet confirm in proof:<br/>
First, living creatures are sometimes so small<br/>
That even their third part can nowise be seen;<br/>
Judge, then, the size of any inward organ&mdash;<br/>
What of their sphered heart, their eyes, their limbs,<br/>
The skeleton?&mdash;How tiny thus they are!<br/>
And what besides of those first particles<br/>
Whence soul and mind must fashioned be?&mdash;Seest not<br/>
How nice and how minute? Besides, whatever<br/>
Exhales from out its body a sharp smell&mdash;<br/>
The nauseous absinth, or the panacea,<br/>
Strong southernwood, or bitter centaury&mdash;<br/>
If never so lightly with thy [fingers] twain<br/>
Perchance [thou touch] a one of them<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then why not rather know that images<br/>
Flit hither and thither, many, in many modes,<br/>
Bodiless and invisible?<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But lest<br/>
Haply thou holdest that those images<br/>
Which come from objects are the sole that flit,<br/>
Others indeed there be of own accord<br/>
Begot, self-formed in earth's aery skies,<br/>
Which, moulded to innumerable shapes,<br/>
Are borne aloft, and, fluid as they are,<br/>
Cease not to change appearance and to turn<br/>
Into new outlines of all sorts of forms;<br/>
As we behold the clouds grow thick on high<br/>
And smirch the serene vision of the world,<br/>
Stroking the air with motions. For oft are seen<br/>
The giants' faces flying far along<br/>
And trailing a spread of shadow; and at times<br/>
The mighty mountains and mountain-sundered rocks<br/>
Going before and crossing on the sun,<br/>
Whereafter a monstrous beast dragging amain<br/>
And leading in the other thunderheads.<br/>
Now [hear] how easy and how swift they be<br/>
Engendered, and perpetually flow off<br/>
From things and gliding pass away....<br/>
</p>
<p>
For ever every outside streams away<br/>
From off all objects, since discharge they may;<br/>
And when this outside reaches other things,<br/>
As chiefly glass, it passes through; but where<br/>
It reaches the rough rocks or stuff of wood,<br/>
There 'tis so rent that it cannot give back<br/>
An image. But when gleaming objects dense,<br/>
As chiefly mirrors, have been set before it,<br/>
Nothing of this sort happens. For it can't<br/>
Go, as through glass, nor yet be rent&mdash;its safety,<br/>
By virtue of that smoothness, being sure.<br/>
'Tis therefore that from them the images<br/>
Stream back to us; and howso suddenly<br/>
Thou place, at any instant, anything<br/>
Before a mirror, there an image shows;<br/>
Proving that ever from a body's surface<br/>
Flow off thin textures and thin shapes of things.<br/>
Thus many images in little time<br/>
Are gendered; so their origin is named<br/>
Rightly a speedy. And even as the sun<br/>
Must send below, in little time, to earth<br/>
So many beams to keep all things so full<br/>
Of light incessant; thus, on grounds the same,<br/>
From things there must be borne, in many modes,<br/>
To every quarter round, upon the moment,<br/>
The many images of things; because<br/>
Unto whatever face of things we turn<br/>
The mirror, things of form and hue the same<br/>
Respond. Besides, though but a moment since<br/>
Serenest was the weather of the sky,<br/>
So fiercely sudden is it foully thick<br/>
That ye might think that round about all murk<br/>
Had parted forth from Acheron and filled<br/>
The mighty vaults of sky&mdash;so grievously,<br/>
As gathers thus the storm-clouds' gruesome night,<br/>
Do faces of black horror hang on high&mdash;<br/>
Of which how small a part an image is<br/>
There's none to tell or reckon out in words.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now come; with what swift motion they are borne,<br/>
These images, and what the speed assigned<br/>
To them across the breezes swimming on&mdash;<br/>
So that o'er lengths of space a little hour<br/>
Alone is wasted, toward whatever region<br/>
Each with its divers impulse tends&mdash;I'll tell<br/>
In verses sweeter than they many are;<br/>
Even as the swan's slight note is better far<br/>
Than that dispersed clamour of the cranes<br/>
Among the southwind's aery clouds. And first,<br/>
One oft may see that objects which are light<br/>
And made of tiny bodies are the swift;<br/>
In which class is the sun's light and his heat,<br/>
Since made from small primordial elements<br/>
Which, as it were, are forward knocked along<br/>
And through the interspaces of the air<br/>
To pass delay not, urged by blows behind;<br/>
For light by light is instantly supplied<br/>
And gleam by following gleam is spurred and driven.<br/>
Thus likewise must the images have power<br/>
Through unimaginable space to speed<br/>
Within a point of time,&mdash;first, since a cause<br/>
Exceeding small there is, which at their back<br/>
Far forward drives them and propels, where, too,<br/>
They're carried with such winged lightness on;<br/>
And, secondly, since furnished, when sent off,<br/>
With texture of such rareness that they can<br/>
Through objects whatsoever penetrate<br/>
And ooze, as 'twere, through intervening air.<br/>
Besides, if those fine particles of things<br/>
Which from so deep within are sent abroad,<br/>
As light and heat of sun, are seen to glide<br/>
And spread themselves through all the space of heaven<br/>
Upon one instant of the day, and fly<br/>
O'er sea and lands and flood the heaven, what then<br/>
Of those which on the outside stand prepared,<br/>
When they're hurled off with not a thing to check<br/>
Their going out? Dost thou not see indeed<br/>
How swifter and how farther must they go<br/>
And speed through manifold the length of space<br/>
In time the same that from the sun the rays<br/>
O'erspread the heaven? This also seems to be<br/>
Example chief and true with what swift speed<br/>
The images of things are borne about:<br/>
That soon as ever under open skies<br/>
Is spread the shining water, all at once,<br/>
If stars be out in heaven, upgleam from earth,<br/>
Serene and radiant in the water there,<br/>
The constellations of the universe&mdash;<br/>
Now seest thou not in what a point of time<br/>
An image from the shores of ether falls<br/>
Unto the shores of earth? Wherefore, again,<br/>
And yet again, 'tis needful to confess<br/>
With wondrous bodies that strike the eyes, awaking sight.<br/>
From certain things flow odours evermore,<br/>
As cold from rivers, heat from sun, and spray<br/>
From waves of ocean, eater-out of walls<br/>
Around the coasts. Nor ever cease to flit<br/>
The varied voices, sounds athrough the air.<br/>
Then too there comes into the mouth at times<br/>
The wet of a salt taste, when by the sea<br/>
We roam about; and so, whene'er we watch<br/>
The wormword being mixed, its bitter stings.<br/>
To such degree from all things is each thing<br/>
Borne streamingly along, and sent about<br/>
To every region round; and nature grants<br/>
Nor rest nor respite of the onward flow,<br/>
Since 'tis incessantly we feeling have,<br/>
And all the time are suffered to descry<br/>
And smell all things at hand, and hear them sound.<br/>
Besides, since shape examined by our hands<br/>
Within the dark is known to be the same<br/>
As that by eyes perceived within the light<br/>
And lustrous day, both touch and sight must be<br/>
By one like cause aroused. So, if we test<br/>
A square and get its stimulus on us<br/>
Within the dark, within the light what square<br/>
Can fall upon our sight, except a square<br/>
That images the things? Wherefore it seems<br/>
The source of seeing is in images,<br/>
Nor without these can anything be viewed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now these same films I name are borne about<br/>
And tossed and scattered into regions all.<br/>
But since we do perceive alone through eyes,<br/>
It follows hence that whitherso we turn<br/>
Our sight, all things do strike against it there<br/>
With form and hue. And just how far from us<br/>
Each thing may be away, the image yields<br/>
To us the power to see and chance to tell:<br/>
For when 'tis sent, at once it shoves ahead<br/>
And drives along the air that's in the space<br/>
Betwixt it and our eyes. And thus this air<br/>
All glides athrough our eyeballs, and, as 'twere,<br/>
Brushes athrough our pupils and thuswise<br/>
Passes across. Therefore it comes we see<br/>
How far from us each thing may be away,<br/>
And the more air there be that's driven before,<br/>
And too the longer be the brushing breeze<br/>
Against our eyes, the farther off removed<br/>
Each thing is seen to be: forsooth, this work<br/>
With mightily swift order all goes on,<br/>
So that upon one instant we may see<br/>
What kind the object and how far away.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor over-marvellous must this be deemed<br/>
In these affairs that, though the films which strike<br/>
Upon the eyes cannot be singly seen,<br/>
The things themselves may be perceived. For thus<br/>
When the wind beats upon us stroke by stroke<br/>
And when the sharp cold streams, 'tis not our wont<br/>
To feel each private particle of wind<br/>
Or of that cold, but rather all at once;<br/>
And so we see how blows affect our body,<br/>
As if one thing were beating on the same<br/>
And giving us the feel of its own body<br/>
Outside of us. Again, whene'er we thump<br/>
With finger-tip upon a stone, we touch<br/>
But the rock's surface and the outer hue,<br/>
Nor feel that hue by contact&mdash;rather feel<br/>
The very hardness deep within the rock.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now come, and why beyond a looking-glass<br/>
An image may be seen, perceive. For seen<br/>
It soothly is, removed far within.<br/>
'Tis the same sort as objects peered upon<br/>
Outside in their true shape, whene'er a door<br/>
Yields through itself an open peering-place,<br/>
And lets us see so many things outside<br/>
Beyond the house. Also that sight is made<br/>
By a twofold twin air: for first is seen<br/>
The air inside the door-posts; next the doors,<br/>
The twain to left and right; and afterwards<br/>
A light beyond comes brushing through our eyes,<br/>
Then other air, then objects peered upon<br/>
Outside in their true shape. And thus, when first<br/>
The image of the glass projects itself,<br/>
As to our gaze it comes, it shoves ahead<br/>
And drives along the air that's in the space<br/>
Betwixt it and our eyes, and brings to pass<br/>
That we perceive the air ere yet the glass.<br/>
But when we've also seen the glass itself,<br/>
Forthwith that image which from us is borne<br/>
Reaches the glass, and there thrown back again<br/>
Comes back unto our eyes, and driving rolls<br/>
Ahead of itself another air, that then<br/>
'Tis this we see before itself, and thus<br/>
It looks so far removed behind the glass.<br/>
Wherefore again, again, there's naught for wonder<br/>
</p>
<p>
In those which render from the mirror's plane<br/>
A vision back, since each thing comes to pass<br/>
By means of the two airs. Now, in the glass<br/>
The right part of our members is observed<br/>
Upon the left, because, when comes the image<br/>
Hitting against the level of the glass,<br/>
'Tis not returned unshifted; but forced off<br/>
Backwards in line direct and not oblique,&mdash;<br/>
Exactly as whoso his plaster-mask<br/>
Should dash, before 'twere dry, on post or beam,<br/>
And it should straightway keep, at clinging there,<br/>
Its shape, reversed, facing him who threw,<br/>
And so remould the features it gives back:<br/>
It comes that now the right eye is the left,<br/>
The left the right. An image too may be<br/>
From mirror into mirror handed on,<br/>
Until of idol-films even five or six<br/>
Have thus been gendered. For whatever things<br/>
Shall hide back yonder in the house, the same,<br/>
However far removed in twisting ways,<br/>
May still be all brought forth through bending paths<br/>
And by these several mirrors seen to be<br/>
Within the house, since nature so compels<br/>
All things to be borne backward and spring off<br/>
At equal angles from all other things.<br/>
To such degree the image gleams across<br/>
From mirror unto mirror; where 'twas left<br/>
It comes to be the right, and then again<br/>
Returns and changes round unto the left.<br/>
Again, those little sides of mirrors curved<br/>
Proportionate to the bulge of our own flank<br/>
Send back to us their idols with the right<br/>
Upon the right; and this is so because<br/>
Either the image is passed on along<br/>
From mirror unto mirror, and thereafter,<br/>
When twice dashed off, flies back unto ourselves;<br/>
Or else the image wheels itself around,<br/>
When once unto the mirror it has come,<br/>
Since the curved surface teaches it to turn<br/>
To usward. Further, thou might'st well believe<br/>
That these film-idols step along with us<br/>
And set their feet in unison with ours<br/>
And imitate our carriage, since from that<br/>
Part of a mirror whence thou hast withdrawn<br/>
Straightway no images can be returned.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Further, our eye-balls tend to flee the bright<br/>
And shun to gaze thereon; the sun even blinds,<br/>
If thou goest on to strain them unto him,<br/>
Because his strength is mighty, and the films<br/>
Heavily downward from on high are borne<br/>
Through the pure ether and the viewless winds,<br/>
And strike the eyes, disordering their joints.<br/>
So piecing lustre often burns the eyes,<br/>
Because it holdeth many seeds of fire<br/>
Which, working into eyes, engender pain.<br/>
Again, whatever jaundiced people view<br/>
Becomes wan-yellow, since from out their bodies<br/>
Flow many seeds wan-yellow forth to meet<br/>
The films of things, and many too are mixed<br/>
Within their eye, which by contagion paint<br/>
All things with sallowness. Again, we view<br/>
From dark recesses things that stand in light,<br/>
Because, when first has entered and possessed<br/>
The open eyes this nearer darkling air,<br/>
Swiftly the shining air and luminous<br/>
Followeth in, which purges then the eyes<br/>
And scatters asunder of that other air<br/>
The sable shadows, for in large degrees<br/>
This air is nimbler, nicer, and more strong.<br/>
And soon as ever 'thas filled and oped with light<br/>
The pathways of the eyeballs, which before<br/>
Black air had blocked, there follow straightaway<br/>
Those films of things out-standing in the light,<br/>
Provoking vision&mdash;what we cannot do<br/>
From out the light with objects in the dark,<br/>
Because that denser darkling air behind<br/>
Followeth in, and fills each aperture<br/>
And thus blockades the pathways of the eyes<br/>
That there no images of any things<br/>
Can be thrown in and agitate the eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And when from far away we do behold<br/>
The squared towers of a city, oft<br/>
Rounded they seem,&mdash;on this account because<br/>
Each distant angle is perceived obtuse,<br/>
Or rather it is not perceived at all;<br/>
And perishes its blow nor to our gaze<br/>
Arrives its stroke, since through such length of air<br/>
Are borne along the idols that the air<br/>
Makes blunt the idol of the angle's point<br/>
By numerous collidings. When thuswise<br/>
The angles of the tower each and all<br/>
Have quite escaped the sense, the stones appear<br/>
As rubbed and rounded on a turner's wheel&mdash;<br/>
Yet not like objects near and truly round,<br/>
But with a semblance to them, shadowily.<br/>
Likewise, our shadow in the sun appears<br/>
To move along and follow our own steps<br/>
And imitate our carriage&mdash;if thou thinkest<br/>
Air that is thus bereft of light can walk,<br/>
Following the gait and motion of mankind.<br/>
For what we use to name a shadow, sure<br/>
Is naught but air deprived of light. No marvel:<br/>
Because the earth from spot to spot is reft<br/>
Progressively of light of sun, whenever<br/>
In moving round we get within its way,<br/>
While any spot of earth by us abandoned<br/>
Is filled with light again, on this account<br/>
It comes to pass that what was body's shadow<br/>
Seems still the same to follow after us<br/>
In one straight course. Since, evermore pour in<br/>
New lights of rays, and perish then the old,<br/>
Just like the wool that's drawn into the flame.<br/>
Therefore the earth is easily spoiled of light<br/>
And easily refilled and from herself<br/>
Washeth the black shadows quite away.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And yet in this we don't at all concede<br/>
That eyes be cheated. For their task it is<br/>
To note in whatsoever place be light,<br/>
In what be shadow: whether or no the gleams<br/>
Be still the same, and whether the shadow which<br/>
Just now was here is that one passing thither,<br/>
Or whether the facts be what we said above,<br/>
'Tis after all the reasoning of mind<br/>
That must decide; nor can our eyeballs know<br/>
The nature of reality. And so<br/>
Attach thou not this fault of mind to eyes,<br/>
Nor lightly think our senses everywhere<br/>
Are tottering. The ship in which we sail<br/>
Is borne along, although it seems to stand;<br/>
The ship that bides in roadstead is supposed<br/>
There to be passing by. And hills and fields<br/>
Seem fleeing fast astern, past which we urge<br/>
The ship and fly under the bellying sails.<br/>
The stars, each one, do seem to pause, affixed<br/>
To the ethereal caverns, though they all<br/>
Forever are in motion, rising out<br/>
And thence revisiting their far descents<br/>
When they have measured with their bodies bright<br/>
The span of heaven. And likewise sun and moon<br/>
Seem biding in a roadstead,&mdash;objects which,<br/>
As plain fact proves, are really borne along.<br/>
Between two mountains far away aloft<br/>
From midst the whirl of waters open lies<br/>
A gaping exit for the fleet, and yet<br/>
They seem conjoined in a single isle.<br/>
When boys themselves have stopped their spinning round,<br/>
The halls still seem to whirl and posts to reel,<br/>
Until they now must almost think the roofs<br/>
Threaten to ruin down upon their heads.<br/>
And now, when nature begins to lift on high<br/>
The sun's red splendour and the tremulous fires,<br/>
And raise him o'er the mountain-tops, those mountains&mdash;<br/>
O'er which he seemeth then to thee to be,<br/>
His glowing self hard by atingeing them<br/>
With his own fire&mdash;are yet away from us<br/>
Scarcely two thousand arrow-shots, indeed<br/>
Oft scarce five hundred courses of a dart;<br/>
Although between those mountains and the sun<br/>
Lie the huge plains of ocean spread beneath<br/>
The vasty shores of ether, and intervene<br/>
A thousand lands, possessed by many a folk<br/>
And generations of wild beasts. Again,<br/>
A pool of water of but a finger's depth,<br/>
Which lies between the stones along the pave,<br/>
Offers a vision downward into earth<br/>
As far, as from the earth o'erspread on high<br/>
The gulfs of heaven; that thus thou seemest to view<br/>
Clouds down below and heavenly bodies plunged<br/>
Wondrously in heaven under earth.<br/>
Then too, when in the middle of the stream<br/>
Sticks fast our dashing horse, and down we gaze<br/>
Into the river's rapid waves, some force<br/>
Seems then to bear the body of the horse,<br/>
Though standing still, reversely from his course,<br/>
And swiftly push up-stream. And wheresoe'er<br/>
We cast our eyes across, all objects seem<br/>
Thus to be onward borne and flow along<br/>
In the same way as we. A portico,<br/>
Albeit it stands well propped from end to end<br/>
On equal columns, parallel and big,<br/>
Contracts by stages in a narrow cone,<br/>
When from one end the long, long whole is seen,&mdash;<br/>
Until, conjoining ceiling with the floor,<br/>
And the whole right side with the left, it draws<br/>
Together to a cone's nigh-viewless point.<br/>
To sailors on the main the sun he seems<br/>
From out the waves to rise, and in the waves<br/>
To set and bury his light&mdash;because indeed<br/>
They gaze on naught but water and the sky.<br/>
Again, to gazers ignorant of the sea,<br/>
Vessels in port seem, as with broken poops,<br/>
To lean upon the water, quite agog;<br/>
For any portion of the oars that's raised<br/>
Above the briny spray is straight, and straight<br/>
The rudders from above. But other parts,<br/>
Those sunk, immersed below the water-line,<br/>
Seem broken all and bended and inclined<br/>
Sloping to upwards, and turned back to float<br/>
Almost atop the water. And when the winds<br/>
Carry the scattered drifts along the sky<br/>
In the night-time, then seem to glide along<br/>
The radiant constellations 'gainst the clouds<br/>
And there on high to take far other course<br/>
From that whereon in truth they're borne. And then,<br/>
If haply our hand be set beneath one eye<br/>
And press below thereon, then to our gaze<br/>
Each object which we gaze on seems to be,<br/>
By some sensation twain&mdash;then twain the lights<br/>
Of lampions burgeoning in flowers of flame,<br/>
And twain the furniture in all the house,<br/>
Two-fold the visages of fellow-men,<br/>
And twain their bodies. And again, when sleep<br/>
Has bound our members down in slumber soft<br/>
And all the body lies in deep repose,<br/>
Yet then we seem to self to be awake<br/>
And move our members; and in night's blind gloom<br/>
We think to mark the daylight and the sun;<br/>
And, shut within a room, yet still we seem<br/>
To change our skies, our oceans, rivers, hills,<br/>
To cross the plains afoot, and hear new sounds,<br/>
Though still the austere silence of the night<br/>
Abides around us, and to speak replies,<br/>
Though voiceless. Other cases of the sort<br/>
Wondrously many do we see, which all<br/>
Seek, so to say, to injure faith in sense&mdash;<br/>
In vain, because the largest part of these<br/>
Deceives through mere opinions of the mind,<br/>
Which we do add ourselves, feigning to see<br/>
What by the senses are not seen at all.<br/>
For naught is harder than to separate<br/>
Plain facts from dubious, which the mind forthwith<br/>
Adds by itself.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, if one suppose<br/>
That naught is known, he knows not whether this<br/>
Itself is able to be known, since he<br/>
Confesses naught to know. Therefore with him<br/>
I waive discussion&mdash;who has set his head<br/>
Even where his feet should be. But let me grant<br/>
That this he knows,&mdash;I question: whence he knows<br/>
What 'tis to know and not-to-know in turn,<br/>
And what created concept of the truth,<br/>
And what device has proved the dubious<br/>
To differ from the certain?&mdash;since in things<br/>
He's heretofore seen naught of true. Thou'lt find<br/>
That from the senses first hath been create<br/>
Concept of truth, nor can the senses be<br/>
Rebutted. For criterion must be found<br/>
Worthy of greater trust, which shall defeat<br/>
Through own authority the false by true;<br/>
What, then, than these our senses must there be<br/>
Worthy a greater trust? Shall reason, sprung<br/>
From some false sense, prevail to contradict<br/>
Those senses, sprung as reason wholly is<br/>
From out the senses?&mdash;For lest these be true,<br/>
All reason also then is falsified.<br/>
Or shall the ears have power to blame the eyes,<br/>
Or yet the touch the ears? Again, shall taste<br/>
Accuse this touch or shall the nose confute<br/>
Or eyes defeat it? Methinks not so it is:<br/>
For unto each has been divided off<br/>
Its function quite apart, its power to each;<br/>
And thus we're still constrained to perceive<br/>
The soft, the cold, the hot apart, apart<br/>
All divers hues and whatso things there be<br/>
Conjoined with hues. Likewise the tasting tongue<br/>
Has its own power apart, and smells apart<br/>
And sounds apart are known. And thus it is<br/>
That no one sense can e'er convict another.<br/>
Nor shall one sense have power to blame itself,<br/>
Because it always must be deemed the same,<br/>
Worthy of equal trust. And therefore what<br/>
At any time unto these senses showed,<br/>
The same is true. And if the reason be<br/>
Unable to unravel us the cause<br/>
Why objects, which at hand were square, afar<br/>
Seemed rounded, yet it more availeth us,<br/>
Lacking the reason, to pretend a cause<br/>
For each configuration, than to let<br/>
From out our hands escape the obvious things<br/>
And injure primal faith in sense, and wreck<br/>
All those foundations upon which do rest<br/>
Our life and safety. For not only reason<br/>
Would topple down; but even our very life<br/>
Would straightaway collapse, unless we dared<br/>
To trust our senses and to keep away<br/>
From headlong heights and places to be shunned<br/>
Of a like peril, and to seek with speed<br/>
Their opposites! Again, as in a building,<br/>
If the first plumb-line be askew, and if<br/>
The square deceiving swerve from lines exact,<br/>
And if the level waver but the least<br/>
In any part, the whole construction then<br/>
Must turn out faulty&mdash;shelving and askew,<br/>
Leaning to back and front, incongruous,<br/>
That now some portions seem about to fall,<br/>
And falls the whole ere long&mdash;betrayed indeed<br/>
By first deceiving estimates: so too<br/>
Thy calculations in affairs of life<br/>
Must be askew and false, if sprung for thee<br/>
From senses false. So all that troop of words<br/>
Marshalled against the senses is quite vain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now remains to demonstrate with ease<br/>
How other senses each their things perceive.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Firstly, a sound and every voice is heard,<br/>
When, getting into ears, they strike the sense<br/>
With their own body. For confess we must<br/>
Even voice and sound to be corporeal,<br/>
Because they're able on the sense to strike.<br/>
Besides voice often scrapes against the throat,<br/>
And screams in going out do make more rough<br/>
The wind-pipe&mdash;naturally enough, methinks,<br/>
When, through the narrow exit rising up<br/>
In larger throng, these primal germs of voice<br/>
Have thus begun to issue forth. In sooth,<br/>
Also the door of the mouth is scraped against<br/>
[By air blown outward] from distended [cheeks].<br/>
</p>
<p>
And thus no doubt there is, that voice and words<br/>
Consist of elements corporeal,<br/>
With power to pain. Nor art thou unaware<br/>
Likewise how much of body's ta'en away,<br/>
How much from very thews and powers of men<br/>
May be withdrawn by steady talk, prolonged<br/>
Even from the rising splendour of the morn<br/>
To shadows of black evening,&mdash;above all<br/>
If 't be outpoured with most exceeding shouts.<br/>
Therefore the voice must be corporeal,<br/>
Since the long talker loses from his frame<br/>
A part.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, roughness in the sound<br/>
Comes from the roughness in the primal germs,<br/>
As a smooth sound from smooth ones is create;<br/>
Nor have these elements a form the same<br/>
When the trump rumbles with a hollow roar,<br/>
As when barbaric Berecynthian pipe<br/>
Buzzes with raucous boomings, or when swans<br/>
By night from icy shores of Helicon<br/>
With wailing voices raise their liquid dirge.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus, when from deep within our frame we force<br/>
These voices, and at mouth expel them forth,<br/>
The mobile tongue, artificer of words,<br/>
Makes them articulate, and too the lips<br/>
By their formations share in shaping them.<br/>
Hence when the space is short from starting-point<br/>
To where that voice arrives, the very words<br/>
Must too be plainly heard, distinctly marked.<br/>
For then the voice conserves its own formation,<br/>
Conserves its shape. But if the space between<br/>
Be longer than is fit, the words must be<br/>
Through the much air confounded, and the voice<br/>
Disordered in its flight across the winds&mdash;<br/>
And so it haps, that thou canst sound perceive,<br/>
Yet not determine what the words may mean;<br/>
To such degree confounded and encumbered<br/>
The voice approaches us. Again, one word,<br/>
Sent from the crier's mouth, may rouse all ears<br/>
Among the populace. And thus one voice<br/>
Scatters asunder into many voices,<br/>
Since it divides itself for separate ears,<br/>
Imprinting form of word and a clear tone.<br/>
But whatso part of voices fails to hit<br/>
The ears themselves perishes, borne beyond,<br/>
Idly diffused among the winds. A part,<br/>
Beating on solid porticoes, tossed back<br/>
Returns a sound; and sometimes mocks the ear<br/>
With a mere phantom of a word. When this<br/>
Thou well hast noted, thou canst render count<br/>
Unto thyself and others why it is<br/>
Along the lonely places that the rocks<br/>
Give back like shapes of words in order like,<br/>
When search we after comrades wandering<br/>
Among the shady mountains, and aloud<br/>
Call unto them, the scattered. I have seen<br/>
Spots that gave back even voices six or seven<br/>
For one thrown forth&mdash;for so the very hills,<br/>
Dashing them back against the hills, kept on<br/>
With their reverberations. And these spots<br/>
The neighbouring country-side doth feign to be<br/>
Haunts of the goat-foot satyrs and the nymphs;<br/>
And tells ye there be fauns, by whose night noise<br/>
And antic revels yonder they declare<br/>
The voiceless silences are broken oft,<br/>
And tones of strings are made and wailings sweet<br/>
Which the pipe, beat by players' finger-tips,<br/>
Pours out; and far and wide the farmer-race<br/>
Begins to hear, when, shaking the garmentings<br/>
Of pine upon his half-beast head, god-Pan<br/>
With puckered lip oft runneth o'er and o'er<br/>
The open reeds,&mdash;lest flute should cease to pour<br/>
The woodland music! Other prodigies<br/>
And wonders of this ilk they love to tell,<br/>
Lest they be thought to dwell in lonely spots<br/>
And even by gods deserted. This is why<br/>
They boast of marvels in their story-tellings;<br/>
Or by some other reason are led on&mdash;<br/>
Greedy, as all mankind hath ever been,<br/>
To prattle fables into ears.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again,<br/>
One need not wonder how it comes about<br/>
That through those places (through which eyes cannot<br/>
View objects manifest) sounds yet may pass<br/>
And assail the ears. For often we observe<br/>
People conversing, though the doors be closed;<br/>
No marvel either, since all voice unharmed<br/>
Can wind through bended apertures of things,<br/>
While idol-films decline to&mdash;for they're rent,<br/>
Unless along straight apertures they swim,<br/>
Like those in glass, through which all images<br/>
Do fly across. And yet this voice itself,<br/>
In passing through shut chambers of a house,<br/>
Is dulled, and in a jumble enters ears,<br/>
And sound we seem to hear far more than words.<br/>
Moreover, a voice is into all directions<br/>
Divided up, since off from one another<br/>
New voices are engendered, when one voice<br/>
Hath once leapt forth, outstarting into many&mdash;<br/>
As oft a spark of fire is wont to sprinkle<br/>
Itself into its several fires. And so,<br/>
Voices do fill those places hid behind,<br/>
Which all are in a hubbub round about,<br/>
Astir with sound. But idol-films do tend,<br/>
As once sent forth, in straight directions all;<br/>
Wherefore one can inside a wall see naught,<br/>
Yet catch the voices from beyond the same.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor tongue and palate, whereby we flavour feel,<br/>
Present more problems for more work of thought.<br/>
Firstly, we feel a flavour in the mouth,<br/>
When forth we squeeze it, in chewing up our food,&mdash;<br/>
As any one perchance begins to squeeze<br/>
With hand and dry a sponge with water soaked.<br/>
Next, all which forth we squeeze is spread about<br/>
Along the pores and intertwined paths<br/>
Of the loose-textured tongue. And so, when smooth<br/>
The bodies of the oozy flavour, then<br/>
Delightfully they touch, delightfully<br/>
They treat all spots, around the wet and trickling<br/>
Enclosures of the tongue. And contrariwise,<br/>
They sting and pain the sense with their assault,<br/>
According as with roughness they're supplied.<br/>
Next, only up to palate is the pleasure<br/>
Coming from flavour; for in truth when down<br/>
'Thas plunged along the throat, no pleasure is,<br/>
Whilst into all the frame it spreads around;<br/>
Nor aught it matters with what food is fed<br/>
The body, if only what thou take thou canst<br/>
Distribute well digested to the frame<br/>
And keep the stomach in a moist career.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now, how it is we see some food for some,<br/>
Others for others....<br/>
</p>
<p>
I will unfold, or wherefore what to some<br/>
Is foul and bitter, yet the same to others<br/>
Can seem delectable to eat,&mdash;why here<br/>
So great the distance and the difference is<br/>
That what is food to one to some becomes<br/>
Fierce poison, as a certain snake there is<br/>
Which, touched by spittle of a man, will waste<br/>
And end itself by gnawing up its coil.<br/>
Again, fierce poison is the hellebore<br/>
To us, but puts the fat on goats and quails.<br/>
That thou mayst know by what devices this<br/>
Is brought about, in chief thou must recall<br/>
What we have said before, that seeds are kept<br/>
Commixed in things in divers modes. Again,<br/>
As all the breathing creatures which take food<br/>
Are outwardly unlike, and outer cut<br/>
And contour of their members bounds them round,<br/>
Each differing kind by kind, they thus consist<br/>
Of seeds of varying shape. And furthermore,<br/>
Since seeds do differ, divers too must be<br/>
The interstices and paths (which we do call<br/>
The apertures) in all the members, even<br/>
In mouth and palate too. Thus some must be<br/>
More small or yet more large, three-cornered some<br/>
And others squared, and many others round,<br/>
And certain of them many-angled too<br/>
In many modes. For, as the combination<br/>
And motion of their divers shapes demand,<br/>
The shapes of apertures must be diverse<br/>
And paths must vary according to their walls<br/>
That bound them. Hence when what is sweet to some,<br/>
Becomes to others bitter, for him to whom<br/>
'Tis sweet, the smoothest particles must needs<br/>
Have entered caressingly the palate's pores.<br/>
And, contrariwise, with those to whom that sweet<br/>
Is sour within the mouth, beyond a doubt<br/>
The rough and barbed particles have got<br/>
Into the narrows of the apertures.<br/>
Now easy it is from these affairs to know<br/>
Whatever...<br/>
</p>
<p>
Indeed, where one from o'er-abundant bile<br/>
Is stricken with fever, or in other wise<br/>
Feels the roused violence of some malady,<br/>
There the whole frame is now upset, and there<br/>
All the positions of the seeds are changed,&mdash;<br/>
So that the bodies which before were fit<br/>
To cause the savour, now are fit no more,<br/>
And now more apt are others which be able<br/>
To get within the pores and gender sour.<br/>
Both sorts, in sooth, are intermixed in honey&mdash;<br/>
What oft we've proved above to thee before.<br/>
Now come, and I will indicate what wise<br/>
Impact of odour on the nostrils touches.<br/>
And first, 'tis needful there be many things<br/>
From whence the streaming flow of varied odours<br/>
May roll along, and we're constrained to think<br/>
They stream and dart and sprinkle themselves about<br/>
Impartially. But for some breathing creatures<br/>
One odour is more apt, to others another&mdash;<br/>
Because of differing forms of seeds and pores.<br/>
Thus on and on along the zephyrs bees<br/>
Are led by odour of honey, vultures too<br/>
By carcasses. Again, the forward power<br/>
Of scent in dogs doth lead the hunter on<br/>
Whithersoever the splay-foot of wild beast<br/>
Hath hastened its career; and the white goose,<br/>
The saviour of the Roman citadel,<br/>
Forescents afar the odour of mankind.<br/>
Thus, diversly to divers ones is given<br/>
Peculiar smell that leadeth each along<br/>
To his own food or makes him start aback<br/>
From loathsome poison, and in this wise are<br/>
The generations of the wild preserved.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yet is this pungence not alone in odours<br/>
Or in the class of flavours; but, likewise,<br/>
The look of things and hues agree not all<br/>
So well with senses unto all, but that<br/>
Some unto some will be, to gaze upon,<br/>
More keen and painful. Lo, the raving lions,<br/>
They dare not face and gaze upon the cock<br/>
Who's wont with wings to flap away the night<br/>
From off the stage, and call the beaming morn<br/>
With clarion voice&mdash;and lions straightway thus<br/>
Bethink themselves of flight, because, ye see,<br/>
Within the body of the cocks there be<br/>
Some certain seeds, which, into lions' eyes<br/>
Injected, bore into the pupils deep<br/>
And yield such piercing pain they can't hold out<br/>
Against the cocks, however fierce they be&mdash;<br/>
Whilst yet these seeds can't hurt our gaze the least,<br/>
Either because they do not penetrate,<br/>
Or since they have free exit from the eyes<br/>
As soon as penetrating, so that thus<br/>
They cannot hurt our eyes in any part<br/>
By there remaining.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak once more of odour;<br/>
Whatever assail the nostrils, some can travel<br/>
A longer way than others. None of them,<br/>
However, 's borne so far as sound or voice&mdash;<br/>
While I omit all mention of such things<br/>
As hit the eyesight and assail the vision.<br/>
For slowly on a wandering course it comes<br/>
And perishes sooner, by degrees absorbed<br/>
Easily into all the winds of air;&mdash;<br/>
And first, because from deep inside the thing<br/>
It is discharged with labour (for the fact<br/>
That every object, when 'tis shivered, ground,<br/>
Or crumbled by the fire, will smell the stronger<br/>
Is sign that odours flow and part away<br/>
From inner regions of the things). And next,<br/>
Thou mayest see that odour is create<br/>
Of larger primal germs than voice, because<br/>
It enters not through stony walls, wherethrough<br/>
Unfailingly the voice and sound are borne;<br/>
Wherefore, besides, thou wilt observe 'tis not<br/>
So easy to trace out in whatso place<br/>
The smelling object is. For, dallying on<br/>
Along the winds, the particles cool off,<br/>
And then the scurrying messengers of things<br/>
Arrive our senses, when no longer hot.<br/>
So dogs oft wander astray, and hunt the scent.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now mark, and hear what objects move the mind,<br/>
And learn, in few, whence unto intellect<br/>
Do come what come. And first I tell thee this:<br/>
That many images of objects rove<br/>
In many modes to every region round&mdash;<br/>
So thin that easily the one with other,<br/>
When once they meet, uniteth in mid-air,<br/>
Like gossamer or gold-leaf. For, indeed,<br/>
Far thinner are they in their fabric than<br/>
Those images which take a hold on eyes<br/>
And smite the vision, since through body's pores<br/>
They penetrate, and inwardly stir up<br/>
The subtle nature of mind and smite the sense.<br/>
Thus, Centaurs and the limbs of Scyllas, thus<br/>
The Cerberus-visages of dogs we see,<br/>
And images of people gone before&mdash;<br/>
Dead men whose bones earth bosomed long ago;<br/>
Because the images of every kind<br/>
Are everywhere about us borne&mdash;in part<br/>
Those which are gendered in the very air<br/>
Of own accord, in part those others which<br/>
From divers things do part away, and those<br/>
Which are compounded, made from out their shapes.<br/>
For soothly from no living Centaur is<br/>
That phantom gendered, since no breed of beast<br/>
Like him was ever; but, when images<br/>
Of horse and man by chance have come together,<br/>
They easily cohere, as aforesaid,<br/>
At once, through subtle nature and fabric thin.<br/>
In the same fashion others of this ilk<br/>
Created are. And when they're quickly borne<br/>
In their exceeding lightness, easily<br/>
(As earlier I showed) one subtle image,<br/>
Compounded, moves by its one blow the mind,<br/>
Itself so subtle and so strangely quick.<br/>
</p>
<p>
That these things come to pass as I record,<br/>
From this thou easily canst understand:<br/>
So far as one is unto other like,<br/>
Seeing with mind as well as with the eyes<br/>
Must come to pass in fashion not unlike.<br/>
Well, now, since I have shown that I perceive<br/>
Haply a lion through those idol-films<br/>
Such as assail my eyes, 'tis thine to know<br/>
Also the mind is in like manner moved,<br/>
And sees, nor more nor less than eyes do see<br/>
(Except that it perceives more subtle films)<br/>
The lion and aught else through idol-films.<br/>
And when the sleep has overset our frame,<br/>
The mind's intelligence is now awake,<br/>
Still for no other reason, save that these&mdash;<br/>
The self-same films as when we are awake&mdash;<br/>
Assail our minds, to such degree indeed<br/>
That we do seem to see for sure the man<br/>
Whom, void of life, now death and earth have gained<br/>
Dominion over. And nature forces this<br/>
To come to pass because the body's senses<br/>
Are resting, thwarted through the members all,<br/>
Unable now to conquer false with true;<br/>
And memory lies prone and languishes<br/>
In slumber, nor protests that he, the man<br/>
Whom the mind feigns to see alive, long since<br/>
Hath been the gain of death and dissolution.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And further, 'tis no marvel idols move<br/>
And toss their arms and other members round<br/>
In rhythmic time&mdash;and often in men's sleeps<br/>
It haps an image this is seen to do;<br/>
In sooth, when perishes the former image,<br/>
And other is gendered of another pose,<br/>
That former seemeth to have changed its gestures.<br/>
Of course the change must be conceived as speedy;<br/>
So great the swiftness and so great the store<br/>
Of idol-things, and (in an instant brief<br/>
As mind can mark) so great, again, the store<br/>
Of separate idol-parts to bring supplies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
It happens also that there is supplied<br/>
Sometimes an image not of kind the same;<br/>
But what before was woman, now at hand<br/>
Is seen to stand there, altered into male;<br/>
Or other visage, other age succeeds;<br/>
But slumber and oblivion take care<br/>
That we shall feel no wonder at the thing.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And much in these affairs demands inquiry,<br/>
And much, illumination&mdash;if we crave<br/>
With plainness to exhibit facts. And first,<br/>
Why doth the mind of one to whom the whim<br/>
To think has come behold forthwith that thing?<br/>
Or do the idols watch upon our will,<br/>
And doth an image unto us occur,<br/>
Directly we desire&mdash;if heart prefer<br/>
The sea, the land, or after all the sky?<br/>
Assemblies of the citizens, parades,<br/>
Banquets, and battles, these and all doth she,<br/>
Nature, create and furnish at our word?&mdash;<br/>
Maugre the fact that in same place and spot<br/>
Another's mind is meditating things<br/>
All far unlike. And what, again, of this:<br/>
When we in sleep behold the idols step,<br/>
In measure, forward, moving supple limbs,<br/>
Whilst forth they put each supple arm in turn<br/>
With speedy motion, and with eyeing heads<br/>
Repeat the movement, as the foot keeps time?<br/>
Forsooth, the idols they are steeped in art,<br/>
And wander to and fro well taught indeed,&mdash;<br/>
Thus to be able in the time of night<br/>
To make such games! Or will the truth be this:<br/>
Because in one least moment that we mark&mdash;<br/>
That is, the uttering of a single sound&mdash;<br/>
There lurk yet many moments, which the reason<br/>
Discovers to exist, therefore it comes<br/>
That, in a moment how so brief ye will,<br/>
The divers idols are hard by, and ready<br/>
Each in its place diverse? So great the swiftness,<br/>
So great, again, the store of idol-things,<br/>
And so, when perishes the former image,<br/>
And other is gendered of another pose,<br/>
The former seemeth to have changed its gestures.<br/>
And since they be so tenuous, mind can mark<br/>
Sharply alone the ones it strains to see;<br/>
And thus the rest do perish one and all,<br/>
Save those for which the mind prepares itself.<br/>
Further, it doth prepare itself indeed,<br/>
And hopes to see what follows after each&mdash;<br/>
Hence this result. For hast thou not observed<br/>
How eyes, essaying to perceive the fine,<br/>
Will strain in preparation, otherwise<br/>
Unable sharply to perceive at all?<br/>
Yet know thou canst that, even in objects plain,<br/>
If thou attendest not, 'tis just the same<br/>
As if 'twere all the time removed and far.<br/>
What marvel, then, that mind doth lose the rest,<br/>
Save those to which 'thas given up itself?<br/>
So 'tis that we conjecture from small signs<br/>
Things wide and weighty, and involve ourselves<br/>
In snarls of self-deceit.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these affairs<br/>
We crave that thou wilt passionately flee<br/>
The one offence, and anxiously wilt shun<br/>
The error of presuming the clear lights<br/>
Of eyes created were that we might see;<br/>
Or thighs and knees, aprop upon the feet,<br/>
Thuswise can bended be, that we might step<br/>
With goodly strides ahead; or forearms joined<br/>
Unto the sturdy uppers, or serving hands<br/>
On either side were given, that we might do<br/>
Life's own demands. All such interpretation<br/>
Is aft-for-fore with inverse reasoning,<br/>
Since naught is born in body so that we<br/>
May use the same, but birth engenders use:<br/>
No seeing ere the lights of eyes were born,<br/>
No speaking ere the tongue created was;<br/>
But origin of tongue came long before<br/>
Discourse of words, and ears created were<br/>
Much earlier than any sound was heard;<br/>
And all the members, so meseems, were there<br/>
Before they got their use: and therefore, they<br/>
Could not be gendered for the sake of use.<br/>
But contrariwise, contending in the fight<br/>
With hand to hand, and rending of the joints,<br/>
And fouling of the limbs with gore, was there,<br/>
O long before the gleaming spears ere flew;<br/>
And nature prompted man to shun a wound,<br/>
Before the left arm by the aid of art<br/>
Opposed the shielding targe. And, verily,<br/>
Yielding the weary body to repose,<br/>
Far ancienter than cushions of soft beds,<br/>
And quenching thirst is earlier than cups.<br/>
These objects, therefore, which for use and life<br/>
Have been devised, can be conceived as found<br/>
For sake of using. But apart from such<br/>
Are all which first were born and afterwards<br/>
Gave knowledge of their own utility&mdash;<br/>
Chief in which sort we note the senses, limbs:<br/>
Wherefore, again, 'tis quite beyond thy power<br/>
To hold that these could thus have been create<br/>
For office of utility.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise,<br/>
'Tis nothing strange that all the breathing creatures<br/>
Seek, even by nature of their frame, their food.<br/>
Yes, since I've taught thee that from off the things<br/>
Stream and depart innumerable bodies<br/>
In modes innumerable too; but most<br/>
Must be the bodies streaming from the living&mdash;<br/>
Which bodies, vexed by motion evermore,<br/>
Are through the mouth exhaled innumerable,<br/>
When weary creatures pant, or through the sweat<br/>
Squeezed forth innumerable from deep within.<br/>
Thus body rarefies, so undermined<br/>
In all its nature, and pain attends its state.<br/>
And so the food is taken to underprop<br/>
The tottering joints, and by its interfusion<br/>
To re-create their powers, and there stop up<br/>
The longing, open-mouthed through limbs and veins,<br/>
For eating. And the moist no less departs<br/>
Into all regions that demand the moist;<br/>
And many heaped-up particles of hot,<br/>
Which cause such burnings in these bellies of ours,<br/>
The liquid on arriving dissipates<br/>
And quenches like a fire, that parching heat<br/>
No longer now can scorch the frame. And so,<br/>
Thou seest how panting thirst is washed away<br/>
From off our body, how the hunger-pang<br/>
It, too, appeased.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, how it comes that we,<br/>
Whene'er we wish, can step with strides ahead,<br/>
And how 'tis given to move our limbs about,<br/>
And what device is wont to push ahead<br/>
This the big load of our corporeal frame,<br/>
I'll say to thee&mdash;do thou attend what's said.<br/>
I say that first some idol-films of walking<br/>
Into our mind do fall and smite the mind,<br/>
As said before. Thereafter will arises;<br/>
For no one starts to do a thing, before<br/>
The intellect previsions what it wills;<br/>
And what it there pre-visioneth depends<br/>
On what that image is. When, therefore, mind<br/>
Doth so bestir itself that it doth will<br/>
To go and step along, it strikes at once<br/>
That energy of soul that's sown about<br/>
In all the body through the limbs and frame&mdash;<br/>
And this is easy of performance, since<br/>
The soul is close conjoined with the mind.<br/>
Next, soul in turn strikes body, and by degrees<br/>
Thus the whole mass is pushed along and moved.<br/>
Then too the body rarefies, and air,<br/>
Forsooth as ever of such nimbleness,<br/>
Comes on and penetrates aboundingly<br/>
Through opened pores, and thus is sprinkled round<br/>
Unto all smallest places in our frame.<br/>
Thus then by these twain factors, severally,<br/>
Body is borne like ship with oars and wind.<br/>
Nor yet in these affairs is aught for wonder<br/>
That particles so fine can whirl around<br/>
So great a body and turn this weight of ours;<br/>
For wind, so tenuous with its subtle body,<br/>
Yet pushes, driving on the mighty ship<br/>
Of mighty bulk; one hand directs the same,<br/>
Whatever its momentum, and one helm<br/>
Whirls it around, whither ye please; and loads,<br/>
Many and huge, are moved and hoisted high<br/>
By enginery of pulley-blocks and wheels,<br/>
With but light strain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, by what modes this sleep<br/>
Pours through our members waters of repose<br/>
And frees the breast from cares of mind, I'll tell<br/>
In verses sweeter than they many are;<br/>
Even as the swan's slight note is better far<br/>
Than that dispersed clamour of the cranes<br/>
Among the southwind's aery clouds. Do thou<br/>
Give me sharp ears and a sagacious mind,&mdash;<br/>
That thou mayst not deny the things to be<br/>
Whereof I'm speaking, nor depart away<br/>
With bosom scorning these the spoken truths,<br/>
Thyself at fault unable to perceive.<br/>
Sleep chiefly comes when energy of soul<br/>
Hath now been scattered through the frame, and part<br/>
Expelled abroad and gone away, and part<br/>
Crammed back and settling deep within the frame&mdash;<br/>
Whereafter then our loosened members droop.<br/>
For doubt is none that by the work of soul<br/>
Exist in us this sense, and when by slumber<br/>
That sense is thwarted, we are bound to think<br/>
The soul confounded and expelled abroad&mdash;<br/>
Yet not entirely, else the frame would lie<br/>
Drenched in the everlasting cold of death.<br/>
In sooth, where no one part of soul remained<br/>
Lurking among the members, even as fire<br/>
Lurks buried under many ashes, whence<br/>
Could sense amain rekindled be in members,<br/>
As flame can rise anew from unseen fire?<br/>
</p>
<p>
By what devices this strange state and new<br/>
May be occasioned, and by what the soul<br/>
Can be confounded and the frame grow faint,<br/>
I will untangle: see to it, thou, that I<br/>
Pour forth my words not unto empty winds.<br/>
In first place, body on its outer parts&mdash;<br/>
Since these are touched by neighbouring aery gusts&mdash;<br/>
Must there be thumped and strook by blows of air<br/>
Repeatedly. And therefore almost all<br/>
Are covered either with hides, or else with shells,<br/>
Or with the horny callus, or with bark.<br/>
Yet this same air lashes their inner parts,<br/>
When creatures draw a breath or blow it out.<br/>
Wherefore, since body thus is flogged alike<br/>
Upon the inside and the out, and blows<br/>
Come in upon us through the little pores<br/>
Even inward to our body's primal parts<br/>
And primal elements, there comes to pass<br/>
By slow degrees, along our members then,<br/>
A kind of overthrow; for then confounded<br/>
Are those arrangements of the primal germs<br/>
Of body and of mind. It comes to pass<br/>
That next a part of soul's expelled abroad,<br/>
A part retreateth in recesses hid,<br/>
A part, too, scattered all about the frame,<br/>
Cannot become united nor engage<br/>
In interchange of motion. Nature now<br/>
So hedges off approaches and the paths;<br/>
And thus the sense, its motions all deranged,<br/>
Retires down deep within; and since there's naught,<br/>
As 'twere, to prop the frame, the body weakens,<br/>
And all the members languish, and the arms<br/>
And eyelids fall, and, as ye lie abed,<br/>
Even there the houghs will sag and loose their powers.<br/>
Again, sleep follows after food, because<br/>
The food produces same result as air,<br/>
Whilst being scattered round through all the veins;<br/>
And much the heaviest is that slumber which,<br/>
Full or fatigued, thou takest; since 'tis then<br/>
That the most bodies disarrange themselves,<br/>
Bruised by labours hard. And in same wise,<br/>
This three-fold change: a forcing of the soul<br/>
Down deeper, more a casting-forth of it,<br/>
A moving more divided in its parts<br/>
And scattered more.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to whate'er pursuit<br/>
A man most clings absorbed, or what the affairs<br/>
On which we theretofore have tarried much,<br/>
And mind hath strained upon the more, we seem<br/>
In sleep not rarely to go at the same.<br/>
The lawyers seem to plead and cite decrees,<br/>
Commanders they to fight and go at frays,<br/>
Sailors to live in combat with the winds,<br/>
And we ourselves indeed to make this book,<br/>
And still to seek the nature of the world<br/>
And set it down, when once discovered, here<br/>
In these my country's leaves. Thus all pursuits,<br/>
All arts in general seem in sleeps to mock<br/>
And master the minds of men. And whosoever<br/>
Day after day for long to games have given<br/>
Attention undivided, still they keep<br/>
(As oft we note), even when they've ceased to grasp<br/>
Those games with their own senses, open paths<br/>
Within the mind wherethrough the idol-films<br/>
Of just those games can come. And thus it is<br/>
For many a day thereafter those appear<br/>
Floating before the eyes, that even awake<br/>
They think they view the dancers moving round<br/>
Their supple limbs, and catch with both the ears<br/>
The liquid song of harp and speaking chords,<br/>
And view the same assembly on the seats,<br/>
And manifold bright glories of the stage&mdash;<br/>
So great the influence of pursuit and zest,<br/>
And of the affairs wherein 'thas been the wont<br/>
Of men to be engaged-nor only men,<br/>
But soothly all the animals. Behold,<br/>
Thou'lt see the sturdy horses, though outstretched,<br/>
Yet sweating in their sleep, and panting ever,<br/>
And straining utmost strength, as if for prize,<br/>
As if, with barriers opened now...<br/>
And hounds of huntsmen oft in soft repose<br/>
Yet toss asudden all their legs about,<br/>
And growl and bark, and with their nostrils sniff<br/>
The winds again, again, as though indeed<br/>
They'd caught the scented foot-prints of wild beasts,<br/>
And, even when wakened, often they pursue<br/>
The phantom images of stags, as though<br/>
They did perceive them fleeing on before,<br/>
Until the illusion's shaken off and dogs<br/>
Come to themselves again. And fawning breed<br/>
Of house-bred whelps do feel the sudden urge<br/>
To shake their bodies and start from off the ground,<br/>
As if beholding stranger-visages.<br/>
And ever the fiercer be the stock, the more<br/>
In sleep the same is ever bound to rage.<br/>
But flee the divers tribes of birds and vex<br/>
With sudden wings by night the groves of gods,<br/>
When in their gentle slumbers they have dreamed<br/>
Of hawks in chase, aswooping on for fight.<br/>
Again, the minds of mortals which perform<br/>
With mighty motions mighty enterprises,<br/>
Often in sleep will do and dare the same<br/>
In manner like. Kings take the towns by storm,<br/>
Succumb to capture, battle on the field,<br/>
Raise a wild cry as if their throats were cut<br/>
Even then and there. And many wrestle on<br/>
And groan with pains, and fill all regions round<br/>
With mighty cries and wild, as if then gnawed<br/>
By fangs of panther or of lion fierce.<br/>
Many amid their slumbers talk about<br/>
Their mighty enterprises, and have often<br/>
Enough become the proof of their own crimes.<br/>
Many meet death; many, as if headlong<br/>
From lofty mountains tumbling down to earth<br/>
With all their frame, are frenzied in their fright;<br/>
And after sleep, as if still mad in mind,<br/>
They scarce come to, confounded as they are<br/>
By ferment of their frame. The thirsty man,<br/>
Likewise, he sits beside delightful spring<br/>
Or river and gulpeth down with gaping throat<br/>
Nigh the whole stream. And oft the innocent young,<br/>
By sleep o'ermastered, think they lift their dress<br/>
By pail or public jordan and then void<br/>
The water filtered down their frame entire<br/>
And drench the Babylonian coverlets,<br/>
Magnificently bright. Again, those males<br/>
Into the surging channels of whose years<br/>
Now first has passed the seed (engendered<br/>
Within their members by the ripened days)<br/>
Are in their sleep confronted from without<br/>
By idol-images of some fair form&mdash;<br/>
Tidings of glorious face and lovely bloom,<br/>
Which stir and goad the regions turgid now<br/>
With seed abundant; so that, as it were<br/>
With all the matter acted duly out,<br/>
They pour the billows of a potent stream<br/>
And stain their garment.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as said before,<br/>
That seed is roused in us when once ripe age<br/>
Has made our body strong...<br/>
As divers causes give to divers things<br/>
Impulse and irritation, so one force<br/>
In human kind rouses the human seed<br/>
To spurt from man. As soon as ever it issues,<br/>
Forced from its first abodes, it passes down<br/>
In the whole body through the limbs and frame,<br/>
Meeting in certain regions of our thews,<br/>
And stirs amain the genitals of man.<br/>
The goaded regions swell with seed, and then<br/>
Comes the delight to dart the same at what<br/>
The mad desire so yearns, and body seeks<br/>
That object, whence the mind by love is pierced.<br/>
For well-nigh each man falleth toward his wound,<br/>
And our blood spurts even toward the spot from whence<br/>
The stroke wherewith we are strook, and if indeed<br/>
The foe be close, the red jet reaches him.<br/>
Thus, one who gets a stroke from Venus' shafts&mdash;<br/>
Whether a boy with limbs effeminate<br/>
Assault him, or a woman darting love<br/>
From all her body&mdash;that one strains to get<br/>
Even to the thing whereby he's hit, and longs<br/>
To join with it and cast into its frame<br/>
The fluid drawn even from within its own.<br/>
For the mute craving doth presage delight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This craving 'tis that's Venus unto us:<br/>
From this, engender all the lures of love,<br/>
From this, O first hath into human hearts<br/>
Trickled that drop of joyance which ere long<br/>
Is by chill care succeeded. Since, indeed,<br/>
Though she thou lovest now be far away,<br/>
Yet idol-images of her are near<br/>
And the sweet name is floating in thy ear.<br/>
But it behooves to flee those images;<br/>
And scare afar whatever feeds thy love;<br/>
And turn elsewhere thy mind; and vent the sperm,<br/>
Within thee gathered, into sundry bodies,<br/>
Nor, with thy thoughts still busied with one love,<br/>
Keep it for one delight, and so store up<br/>
Care for thyself and pain inevitable.<br/>
For, lo, the ulcer just by nourishing<br/>
Grows to more life with deep inveteracy,<br/>
And day by day the fury swells aflame,<br/>
And the woe waxes heavier day by day&mdash;<br/>
Unless thou dost destroy even by new blows<br/>
The former wounds of love, and curest them<br/>
While yet they're fresh, by wandering freely round<br/>
After the freely-wandering Venus, or<br/>
Canst lead elsewhere the tumults of thy mind.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor doth that man who keeps away from love<br/>
Yet lack the fruits of Venus; rather takes<br/>
Those pleasures which are free of penalties.<br/>
For the delights of Venus, verily,<br/>
Are more unmixed for mortals sane-of-soul<br/>
Than for those sick-at-heart with love-pining.<br/>
Yea, in the very moment of possessing,<br/>
Surges the heat of lovers to and fro,<br/>
Restive, uncertain; and they cannot fix<br/>
On what to first enjoy with eyes and hands.<br/>
The parts they sought for, those they squeeze so tight,<br/>
And pain the creature's body, close their teeth<br/>
Often against her lips, and smite with kiss<br/>
Mouth into mouth,&mdash;because this same delight<br/>
Is not unmixed; and underneath are stings<br/>
Which goad a man to hurt the very thing,<br/>
Whate'er it be, from whence arise for him<br/>
Those germs of madness. But with gentle touch<br/>
Venus subdues the pangs in midst of love,<br/>
And the admixture of a fondling joy<br/>
Doth curb the bites of passion. For they hope<br/>
That by the very body whence they caught<br/>
The heats of love their flames can be put out.<br/>
But nature protests 'tis all quite otherwise;<br/>
For this same love it is the one sole thing<br/>
Of which, the more we have, the fiercer burns<br/>
The breast with fell desire. For food and drink<br/>
Are taken within our members; and, since they<br/>
Can stop up certain parts, thus, easily<br/>
Desire of water is glutted and of bread.<br/>
But, lo, from human face and lovely bloom<br/>
Naught penetrates our frame to be enjoyed<br/>
Save flimsy idol-images and vain&mdash;<br/>
A sorry hope which oft the winds disperse.<br/>
As when the thirsty man in slumber seeks<br/>
To drink, and water ne'er is granted him<br/>
Wherewith to quench the heat within his members,<br/>
But after idols of the liquids strives<br/>
And toils in vain, and thirsts even whilst he gulps<br/>
In middle of the torrent, thus in love<br/>
Venus deludes with idol-images<br/>
The lovers. Nor they cannot sate their lust<br/>
By merely gazing on the bodies, nor<br/>
They cannot with their palms and fingers rub<br/>
Aught from each tender limb, the while they stray<br/>
Uncertain over all the body. Then,<br/>
At last, with members intertwined, when they<br/>
Enjoy the flower of their age, when now<br/>
Their bodies have sweet presage of keen joys,<br/>
And Venus is about to sow the fields<br/>
Of woman, greedily their frames they lock,<br/>
And mingle the slaver of their mouths, and breathe<br/>
Into each other, pressing teeth on mouths&mdash;<br/>
Yet to no purpose, since they're powerless<br/>
To rub off aught, or penetrate and pass<br/>
With body entire into body&mdash;for oft<br/>
They seem to strive and struggle thus to do;<br/>
So eagerly they cling in Venus' bonds,<br/>
Whilst melt away their members, overcome<br/>
By violence of delight. But when at last<br/>
Lust, gathered in the thews, hath spent itself,<br/>
There come a brief pause in the raging heat&mdash;<br/>
But then a madness just the same returns<br/>
And that old fury visits them again,<br/>
When once again they seek and crave to reach<br/>
They know not what, all powerless to find<br/>
The artifice to subjugate the bane.<br/>
In such uncertain state they waste away<br/>
With unseen wound.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which be added too,<br/>
They squander powers and with the travail wane;<br/>
Be added too, they spend their futile years<br/>
Under another's beck and call; their duties<br/>
Neglected languish and their honest name<br/>
Reeleth sick, sick; and meantime their estates<br/>
Are lost in Babylonian tapestries;<br/>
And unguents and dainty Sicyonian shoes<br/>
Laugh on her feet; and (as ye may be sure)<br/>
Big emeralds of green light are set in gold;<br/>
And rich sea-purple dress by constant wear<br/>
Grows shabby and all soaked with Venus' sweat;<br/>
And the well-earned ancestral property<br/>
Becometh head-bands, coifs, and many a time<br/>
The cloaks, or garments Alidensian<br/>
Or of the Cean isle. And banquets, set<br/>
With rarest cloth and viands, are prepared&mdash;<br/>
And games of chance, and many a drinking cup,<br/>
And unguents, crowns and garlands. All in vain,<br/>
Since from amid the well-spring of delights<br/>
Bubbles some drop of bitter to torment<br/>
Among the very flowers&mdash;when haply mind<br/>
Gnaws into self, now stricken with remorse<br/>
For slothful years and ruin in baudels,<br/>
Or else because she's left him all in doubt<br/>
By launching some sly word, which still like fire<br/>
Lives wildly, cleaving to his eager heart;<br/>
Or else because he thinks she darts her eyes<br/>
Too much about and gazes at another,&mdash;<br/>
And in her face sees traces of a laugh.<br/>
</p>
<p>
These ills are found in prospering love and true;<br/>
But in crossed love and helpless there be such<br/>
As through shut eyelids thou canst still take in&mdash;<br/>
Uncounted ills; so that 'tis better far<br/>
To watch beforehand, in the way I've shown,<br/>
And guard against enticements. For to shun<br/>
A fall into the hunting-snares of love<br/>
Is not so hard, as to get out again,<br/>
When tangled in the very nets, and burst<br/>
The stoutly-knotted cords of Aphrodite.<br/>
Yet even when there enmeshed with tangled feet,<br/>
Still canst thou scape the danger-lest indeed<br/>
Thou standest in the way of thine own good,<br/>
And overlookest first all blemishes<br/>
Of mind and body of thy much preferred,<br/>
Desirable dame. For so men do,<br/>
Eyeless with passion, and assign to them<br/>
Graces not theirs in fact. And thus we see<br/>
Creatures in many a wise crooked and ugly<br/>
The prosperous sweethearts in a high esteem;<br/>
And lovers gird each other and advise<br/>
To placate Venus, since their friends are smit<br/>
With a base passion&mdash;miserable dupes<br/>
Who seldom mark their own worst bane of all.<br/>
The black-skinned girl is "tawny like the honey";<br/>
The filthy and the fetid's "negligee";<br/>
The cat-eyed she's "a little Pallas," she;<br/>
The sinewy and wizened's "a gazelle";<br/>
The pudgy and the pigmy is "piquant,<br/>
One of the Graces sure"; the big and bulky<br/>
O she's "an Admiration, imposante";<br/>
The stuttering and tongue-tied "sweetly lisps";<br/>
The mute girl's "modest"; and the garrulous,<br/>
The spiteful spit-fire, is "a sparkling wit";<br/>
And she who scarcely lives for scrawniness<br/>
Becomes "a slender darling"; "delicate"<br/>
Is she who's nearly dead of coughing-fit;<br/>
The pursy female with protuberant breasts<br/>
She is "like Ceres when the goddess gave<br/>
Young Bacchus suck"; the pug-nosed lady-love<br/>
"A Satyress, a feminine Silenus";<br/>
The blubber-lipped is "all one luscious kiss"&mdash;<br/>
A weary while it were to tell the whole.<br/>
But let her face possess what charm ye will,<br/>
Let Venus' glory rise from all her limbs,&mdash;<br/>
Forsooth there still are others; and forsooth<br/>
We lived before without her; and forsooth<br/>
She does the same things&mdash;and we know she does&mdash;<br/>
All, as the ugly creature, and she scents,<br/>
Yes she, her wretched self with vile perfumes;<br/>
Whom even her handmaids flee and giggle at<br/>
Behind her back. But he, the lover, in tears<br/>
Because shut out, covers her threshold o'er<br/>
Often with flowers and garlands, and anoints<br/>
Her haughty door-posts with the marjoram,<br/>
And prints, poor fellow, kisses on the doors&mdash;<br/>
Admitted at last, if haply but one whiff<br/>
Got to him on approaching, he would seek<br/>
Decent excuses to go out forthwith;<br/>
And his lament, long pondered, then would fall<br/>
Down at his heels; and there he'd damn himself<br/>
For his fatuity, observing how<br/>
He had assigned to that same lady more&mdash;<br/>
Than it is proper to concede to mortals.<br/>
And these our Venuses are 'ware of this.<br/>
Wherefore the more are they at pains to hide<br/>
All the-behind-the-scenes of life from those<br/>
Whom they desire to keep in bonds of love&mdash;<br/>
In vain, since ne'ertheless thou canst by thought<br/>
Drag all the matter forth into the light<br/>
And well search out the cause of all these smiles;<br/>
And if of graceful mind she be and kind,<br/>
Do thou, in thy turn, overlook the same,<br/>
And thus allow for poor mortality.<br/>
Nor sighs the woman always with feigned love,<br/>
Who links her body round man's body locked<br/>
And holds him fast, making his kisses wet<br/>
With lips sucked into lips; for oft she acts<br/>
Even from desire, and, seeking mutual joys,<br/>
Incites him there to run love's race-course through.<br/>
Nor otherwise can cattle, birds, wild beasts,<br/>
And sheep and mares submit unto the males,<br/>
Except that their own nature is in heat,<br/>
And burns abounding and with gladness takes<br/>
Once more the Venus of the mounting males.<br/>
And seest thou not how those whom mutual pleasure<br/>
Hath bound are tortured in their common bonds?<br/>
How often in the cross-roads dogs that pant<br/>
To get apart strain eagerly asunder<br/>
With utmost might?&mdash;When all the while they're fast<br/>
In the stout links of Venus. But they'd ne'er<br/>
So pull, except they knew those mutual joys&mdash;<br/>
So powerful to cast them unto snares<br/>
And hold them bound. Wherefore again, again,<br/>
Even as I say, there is a joint delight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And when perchance, in mingling seed with his,<br/>
The female hath o'erpowered the force of male<br/>
And by a sudden fling hath seized it fast,<br/>
Then are the offspring, more from mothers' seed,<br/>
More like their mothers; as, from fathers' seed,<br/>
They're like to fathers. But whom seest to be<br/>
Partakers of each shape, one equal blend<br/>
Of parents' features, these are generate<br/>
From fathers' body and from mothers' blood,<br/>
When mutual and harmonious heat hath dashed<br/>
Together seeds, aroused along their frames<br/>
By Venus' goads, and neither of the twain<br/>
Mastereth or is mastered. Happens too<br/>
That sometimes offspring can to being come<br/>
In likeness of their grandsires, and bring back<br/>
Often the shapes of grandsires' sires, because<br/>
Their parents in their bodies oft retain<br/>
Concealed many primal germs, commixed<br/>
In many modes, which, starting with the stock,<br/>
Sire handeth down to son, himself a sire;<br/>
Whence Venus by a variable chance<br/>
Engenders shapes, and diversely brings back<br/>
Ancestral features, voices too, and hair.<br/>
A female generation rises forth<br/>
From seed paternal, and from mother's body<br/>
Exist created males: since sex proceeds<br/>
No more from singleness of seed than faces<br/>
Or bodies or limbs of ours: for every birth<br/>
Is from a twofold seed; and what's created<br/>
Hath, of that parent which it is more like,<br/>
More than its equal share; as thou canst mark,&mdash;<br/>
Whether the breed be male or female stock.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor do the powers divine grudge any man<br/>
The fruits of his seed-sowing, so that never<br/>
He be called "father" by sweet children his,<br/>
And end his days in sterile love forever.<br/>
What many men suppose; and gloomily<br/>
They sprinkle the altars with abundant blood,<br/>
And make the high platforms odorous with burnt gifts,<br/>
To render big by plenteous seed their wives&mdash;<br/>
And plague in vain godheads and sacred lots.<br/>
For sterile are these men by seed too thick,<br/>
Or else by far too watery and thin.<br/>
Because the thin is powerless to cleave<br/>
Fast to the proper places, straightaway<br/>
It trickles from them, and, returned again,<br/>
Retires abortively. And then since seed<br/>
More gross and solid than will suit is spent<br/>
By some men, either it flies not forth amain<br/>
With spurt prolonged enough, or else it fails<br/>
To enter suitably the proper places,<br/>
Or, having entered, the seed is weakly mixed<br/>
With seed of the woman: harmonies of Venus<br/>
Are seen to matter vastly here; and some<br/>
Impregnate some more readily, and from some<br/>
Some women conceive more readily and become<br/>
Pregnant. And many women, sterile before<br/>
In several marriage-beds, have yet thereafter<br/>
Obtained the mates from whom they could conceive<br/>
The baby-boys, and with sweet progeny<br/>
Grow rich. And even for husbands (whose own wives,<br/>
Although of fertile wombs, have borne for them<br/>
No babies in the house) are also found<br/>
Concordant natures so that they at last<br/>
Can bulwark their old age with goodly sons.<br/>
A matter of great moment 'tis in truth,<br/>
That seeds may mingle readily with seeds<br/>
Suited for procreation, and that thick<br/>
Should mix with fluid seeds, with thick the fluid.<br/>
And in this business 'tis of some import<br/>
Upon what diet life is nourished:<br/>
For some foods thicken seeds within our members,<br/>
And others thin them out and waste away.<br/>
And in what modes the fond delight itself<br/>
Is carried on&mdash;this too importeth vastly.<br/>
For commonly 'tis thought that wives conceive<br/>
More readily in manner of wild-beasts,<br/>
After the custom of the four-foot breeds,<br/>
Because so postured, with the breasts beneath<br/>
And buttocks then upreared, the seeds can take<br/>
Their proper places. Nor is need the least<br/>
For wives to use the motions of blandishment;<br/>
For thus the woman hinders and resists<br/>
Her own conception, if too joyously<br/>
Herself she treats the Venus of the man<br/>
With haunches heaving, and with all her bosom<br/>
Now yielding like the billows of the sea&mdash;<br/>
Aye, from the ploughshare's even course and track<br/>
She throws the furrow, and from proper places<br/>
Deflects the spurt of seed. And courtesans<br/>
Are thuswise wont to move for their own ends,<br/>
To keep from pregnancy and lying in,<br/>
And all the while to render Venus more<br/>
A pleasure for the men&mdash;the which meseems<br/>
Our wives have never need of.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes too<br/>
It happens&mdash;and through no divinity<br/>
Nor arrows of Venus&mdash;that a sorry chit<br/>
Of scanty grace will be beloved by man;<br/>
For sometimes she herself by very deeds,<br/>
By her complying ways, and tidy habits,<br/>
Will easily accustom thee to pass<br/>
With her thy life-time&mdash;and, moreover, lo,<br/>
Long habitude can gender human love,<br/>
Even as an object smitten o'er and o'er<br/>
By blows, however lightly, yet at last<br/>
Is overcome and wavers. Seest thou not,<br/>
Besides, how drops of water falling down<br/>
Against the stones at last bore through the stones?<br/>

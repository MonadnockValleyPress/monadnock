<h1>The Nature of Things</h1>
<h2>by Lucretius</h2>
<h3>Book I</h3>
<p>
Mother of Rome, delight of Gods and men,<br/>
Dear Venus that beneath the gliding stars<br/>
Makest to teem the many-voyaged main<br/>
And fruitful lands&mdash;for all of living things<br/>
Through thee alone are evermore conceived,<br/>
Through thee are risen to visit the great sun&mdash;<br/>
Before thee, Goddess, and thy coming on,<br/>
Flee stormy wind and massy cloud away,<br/>
For thee the daedal Earth bears scented flowers,<br/>
For thee waters of the unvexed deep<br/>
Smile, and the hollows of the serene sky<br/>
Glow with diffused radiance for thee!<br/>
For soon as comes the springtime face of day,<br/>
And procreant gales blow from the West unbarred,<br/>
First fowls of air, smit to the heart by thee,<br/>
Foretoken thy approach, O thou Divine,<br/>
And leap the wild herds round the happy fields<br/>
Or swim the bounding torrents. Thus amain,<br/>
Seized with the spell, all creatures follow thee<br/>
Whithersoever thou walkest forth to lead,<br/>
And thence through seas and mountains and swift streams,<br/>
Through leafy homes of birds and greening plains,<br/>
Kindling the lure of love in every breast,<br/>
Thou bringest the eternal generations forth,<br/>
Kind after kind. And since 'tis thou alone<br/>
Guidest the Cosmos, and without thee naught<br/>
Is risen to reach the shining shores of light,<br/>
Nor aught of joyful or of lovely born,<br/>
Thee do I crave co-partner in that verse<br/>
Which I presume on Nature to compose<br/>
For Memmius mine, whom thou hast willed to be<br/>
Peerless in every grace at every hour&mdash;<br/>
Wherefore indeed, Divine one, give my words<br/>
Immortal charm. Lull to a timely rest<br/>
O'er sea and land the savage works of war,<br/>
For thou alone hast power with public peace<br/>
To aid mortality; since he who rules<br/>
The savage works of battle, puissant Mars,<br/>
How often to thy bosom flings his strength<br/>
O'ermastered by the eternal wound of love&mdash;<br/>
And there, with eyes and full throat backward thrown,<br/>
Gazing, my Goddess, open-mouthed at thee,<br/>
Pastures on love his greedy sight, his breath<br/>
Hanging upon thy lips. Him thus reclined<br/>
Fill with thy holy body, round, above!<br/>
Pour from those lips soft syllables to win<br/>
Peace for the Romans, glorious Lady, peace!<br/>
For in a season troublous to the state<br/>
Neither may I attend this task of mine<br/>
With thought untroubled, nor mid such events<br/>
The illustrious scion of the Memmian house<br/>
Neglect the civic cause.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst human kind<br/>
Throughout the lands lay miserably crushed<br/>
Before all eyes beneath Religion&mdash;who<br/>
Would show her head along the region skies,<br/>
Glowering on mortals with her hideous face&mdash;<br/>
A Greek it was who first opposing dared<br/>
Raise mortal eyes that terror to withstand,<br/>
Whom nor the fame of Gods nor lightning's stroke<br/>
Nor threatening thunder of the ominous sky<br/>
Abashed; but rather chafed to angry zest<br/>
His dauntless heart to be the first to rend<br/>
The crossbars at the gates of Nature old.<br/>
And thus his will and hardy wisdom won;<br/>
And forward thus he fared afar, beyond<br/>
The flaming ramparts of the world, until<br/>
He wandered the unmeasurable All.<br/>
Whence he to us, a conqueror, reports<br/>
What things can rise to being, what cannot,<br/>
And by what law to each its scope prescribed,<br/>
Its boundary stone that clings so deep in Time.<br/>
Wherefore Religion now is under foot,<br/>
And us his victory now exalts to heaven.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I know how hard it is in Latian verse<br/>
To tell the dark discoveries of the Greeks,<br/>
Chiefly because our pauper-speech must find<br/>
Strange terms to fit the strangeness of the thing;<br/>
Yet worth of thine and the expected joy<br/>
Of thy sweet friendship do persuade me on<br/>
To bear all toil and wake the clear nights through,<br/>
Seeking with what of words and what of song<br/>
I may at last most gloriously uncloud<br/>
For thee the light beyond, wherewith to view<br/>
The core of being at the centre hid.<br/>
And for the rest, summon to judgments true,<br/>
Unbusied ears and singleness of mind<br/>
Withdrawn from cares; lest these my gifts, arranged<br/>
For thee with eager service, thou disdain<br/>
Before thou comprehendest: since for thee<br/>
I prove the supreme law of Gods and sky,<br/>
And the primordial germs of things unfold,<br/>
Whence Nature all creates, and multiplies<br/>
And fosters all, and whither she resolves<br/>
Each in the end when each is overthrown.<br/>
This ultimate stock we have devised to name<br/>
Procreant atoms, matter, seeds of things,<br/>
Or primal bodies, as primal to the world.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I fear perhaps thou deemest that we fare<br/>
An impious road to realms of thought profane;<br/>
But 'tis that same religion oftener far<br/>
Hath bred the foul impieties of men:<br/>
As once at Aulis, the elected chiefs,<br/>
Foremost of heroes, Danaan counsellors,<br/>
Defiled Diana's altar, virgin queen,<br/>
With Agamemnon's daughter, foully slain.<br/>
She felt the chaplet round her maiden locks<br/>
And fillets, fluttering down on either cheek,<br/>
And at the altar marked her grieving sire,<br/>
The priests beside him who concealed the knife,<br/>
And all the folk in tears at sight of her.<br/>
With a dumb terror and a sinking knee<br/>
She dropped; nor might avail her now that first<br/>
'Twas she who gave the king a father's name.<br/>
They raised her up, they bore the trembling girl<br/>
On to the altar&mdash;hither led not now<br/>
With solemn rites and hymeneal choir,<br/>
But sinless woman, sinfully foredone,<br/>
A parent felled her on her bridal day,<br/>
Making his child a sacrificial beast<br/>
To give the ships auspicious winds for Troy:<br/>
Such are the crimes to which Religion leads.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And there shall come the time when even thou,<br/>
Forced by the soothsayer's terror-tales, shalt seek<br/>
To break from us. Ah, many a dream even now<br/>
Can they concoct to rout thy plans of life,<br/>
And trouble all thy fortunes with base fears.<br/>
I own with reason: for, if men but knew<br/>
Some fixed end to ills, they would be strong<br/>
By some device unconquered to withstand<br/>
Religions and the menacings of seers.<br/>
But now nor skill nor instrument is theirs,<br/>
Since men must dread eternal pains in death.<br/>
For what the soul may be they do not know,<br/>
Whether 'tis born, or enter in at birth,<br/>
And whether, snatched by death, it die with us,<br/>
Or visit the shadows and the vasty caves<br/>
Of Orcus, or by some divine decree<br/>
Enter the brute herds, as our Ennius sang,<br/>
Who first from lovely Helicon brought down<br/>
A laurel wreath of bright perennial leaves,<br/>
Renowned forever among the Italian clans.<br/>
Yet Ennius too in everlasting verse<br/>
Proclaims those vaults of Acheron to be,<br/>
Though thence, he said, nor souls nor bodies fare,<br/>
But only phantom figures, strangely wan,<br/>
And tells how once from out those regions rose<br/>
Old Homer's ghost to him and shed salt tears<br/>
And with his words unfolded Nature's source.<br/>
Then be it ours with steady mind to clasp<br/>
The purport of the skies&mdash;the law behind<br/>
The wandering courses of the sun and moon;<br/>
To scan the powers that speed all life below;<br/>
But most to see with reasonable eyes<br/>
Of what the mind, of what the soul is made,<br/>
And what it is so terrible that breaks<br/>
On us asleep, or waking in disease,<br/>
Until we seem to mark and hear at hand<br/>
Dead men whose bones earth bosomed long ago.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This terror, then, this darkness of the mind,<br/>
Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,<br/>
Nor glittering arrows of morning can disperse,<br/>
But only Nature's aspect and her law,<br/>
Which, teaching us, hath this exordium:<br/>
Nothing from nothing ever yet was born.<br/>
Fear holds dominion over mortality<br/>
Only because, seeing in land and sky<br/>
So much the cause whereof no wise they know,<br/>
Men think Divinities are working there.<br/>
Meantime, when once we know from nothing still<br/>
Nothing can be create, we shall divine<br/>
More clearly what we seek: those elements<br/>
From which alone all things created are,<br/>
And how accomplished by no tool of Gods.<br/>
Suppose all sprang from all things: any kind<br/>
Might take its origin from any thing,<br/>
No fixed seed required. Men from the sea<br/>
Might rise, and from the land the scaly breed,<br/>
And, fowl full fledged come bursting from the sky;<br/>
The horned cattle, the herds and all the wild<br/>
Would haunt with varying offspring tilth and waste;<br/>
Nor would the same fruits keep their olden trees,<br/>
But each might grow from any stock or limb<br/>
By chance and change. Indeed, and were there not<br/>
For each its procreant atoms, could things have<br/>
Each its unalterable mother old?<br/>
But, since produced from fixed seeds are all,<br/>
Each birth goes forth upon the shores of light<br/>
From its own stuff, from its own primal bodies.<br/>
And all from all cannot become, because<br/>
In each resides a secret power its own.<br/>
Again, why see we lavished o'er the lands<br/>
At spring the rose, at summer heat the corn,<br/>
The vines that mellow when the autumn lures,<br/>
If not because the fixed seeds of things<br/>
At their own season must together stream,<br/>
And new creations only be revealed<br/>
When the due times arrive and pregnant earth<br/>
Safely may give unto the shores of light<br/>
Her tender progenies? But if from naught<br/>
Were their becoming, they would spring abroad<br/>
Suddenly, unforeseen, in alien months,<br/>
With no primordial germs, to be preserved<br/>
From procreant unions at an adverse hour.<br/>
Nor on the mingling of the living seeds<br/>
Would space be needed for the growth of things<br/>
Were life an increment of nothing: then<br/>
The tiny babe forthwith would walk a man,<br/>
And from the turf would leap a branching tree&mdash;<br/>
Wonders unheard of; for, by Nature, each<br/>
Slowly increases from its lawful seed,<br/>
And through that increase shall conserve its kind.<br/>
Whence take the proof that things enlarge and feed<br/>
From out their proper matter. Thus it comes<br/>
That earth, without her seasons of fixed rains,<br/>
Could bear no produce such as makes us glad,<br/>
And whatsoever lives, if shut from food,<br/>
Prolongs its kind and guards its life no more.<br/>
Thus easier 'tis to hold that many things<br/>
Have primal bodies in common (as we see<br/>
The single letters common to many words)<br/>
Than aught exists without its origins.<br/>
Moreover, why should Nature not prepare<br/>
Men of a bulk to ford the seas afoot,<br/>
Or rend the mighty mountains with their hands,<br/>
Or conquer Time with length of days, if not<br/>
Because for all begotten things abides<br/>
The changeless stuff, and what from that may spring<br/>
Is fixed forevermore? Lastly we see<br/>
How far the tilled surpass the fields untilled<br/>
And to the labour of our hands return<br/>
Their more abounding crops; there are indeed<br/>
Within the earth primordial germs of things,<br/>
Which, as the ploughshare turns the fruitful clods<br/>
And kneads the mould, we quicken into birth.<br/>
Else would ye mark, without all toil of ours,<br/>
Spontaneous generations, fairer forms.<br/>
Confess then, naught from nothing can become,<br/>
Since all must have their seeds, wherefrom to grow,<br/>
Wherefrom to reach the gentle fields of air.<br/>
Hence too it comes that Nature all dissolves<br/>
Into their primal bodies again, and naught<br/>
Perishes ever to annihilation.<br/>
For, were aught mortal in its every part,<br/>
Before our eyes it might be snatched away<br/>
Unto destruction; since no force were needed<br/>
To sunder its members and undo its bands.<br/>
Whereas, of truth, because all things exist,<br/>
With seed imperishable, Nature allows<br/>
Destruction nor collapse of aught, until<br/>
Some outward force may shatter by a blow,<br/>
Or inward craft, entering its hollow cells,<br/>
Dissolve it down. And more than this, if Time,<br/>
That wastes with eld the works along the world,<br/>
Destroy entire, consuming matter all,<br/>
Whence then may Venus back to light of life<br/>
Restore the generations kind by kind?<br/>
Or how, when thus restored, may daedal Earth<br/>
Foster and plenish with her ancient food,<br/>
Which, kind by kind, she offers unto each?<br/>
Whence may the water-springs, beneath the sea,<br/>
Or inland rivers, far and wide away,<br/>
Keep the unfathomable ocean full?<br/>
And out of what does Ether feed the stars?<br/>
For lapsed years and infinite age must else<br/>
Have eat all shapes of mortal stock away:<br/>
But be it the Long Ago contained those germs,<br/>
By which this sum of things recruited lives,<br/>
Those same infallibly can never die,<br/>
Nor nothing to nothing evermore return.<br/>
And, too, the selfsame power might end alike<br/>
All things, were they not still together held<br/>
By matter eternal, shackled through its parts,<br/>
Now more, now less. A touch might be enough<br/>
To cause destruction. For the slightest force<br/>
Would loose the weft of things wherein no part<br/>
Were of imperishable stock. But now<br/>
Because the fastenings of primordial parts<br/>
Are put together diversely and stuff<br/>
Is everlasting, things abide the same<br/>
Unhurt and sure, until some power comes on<br/>
Strong to destroy the warp and woof of each:<br/>
Nothing returns to naught; but all return<br/>
At their collapse to primal forms of stuff.<br/>
Lo, the rains perish which Ether-father throws<br/>
Down to the bosom of Earth-mother; but then<br/>
Upsprings the shining grain, and boughs are green<br/>
Amid the trees, and trees themselves wax big<br/>
And lade themselves with fruits; and hence in turn<br/>
The race of man and all the wild are fed;<br/>
Hence joyful cities thrive with boys and girls;<br/>
And leafy woodlands echo with new birds;<br/>
Hence cattle, fat and drowsy, lay their bulk<br/>
Along the joyous pastures whilst the drops<br/>
Of white ooze trickle from distended bags;<br/>
Hence the young scamper on their weakling joints<br/>
Along the tender herbs, fresh hearts afrisk<br/>
With warm new milk. Thus naught of what so seems<br/>
Perishes utterly, since Nature ever<br/>
Upbuilds one thing from other, suffering naught<br/>
To come to birth but through some other's death.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now, since I have taught that things cannot<br/>
Be born from nothing, nor the same, when born,<br/>
To nothing be recalled, doubt not my words,<br/>
Because our eyes no primal germs perceive;<br/>
For mark those bodies which, though known to be<br/>
In this our world, are yet invisible:<br/>
The winds infuriate lash our face and frame,<br/>
Unseen, and swamp huge ships and rend the clouds,<br/>
Or, eddying wildly down, bestrew the plains<br/>
With mighty trees, or scour the mountain tops<br/>
With forest-crackling blasts. Thus on they rave<br/>
With uproar shrill and ominous moan. The winds,<br/>
'Tis clear, are sightless bodies sweeping through<br/>
The sea, the lands, the clouds along the sky,<br/>
Vexing and whirling and seizing all amain;<br/>
And forth they flow and pile destruction round,<br/>
Even as the water's soft and supple bulk<br/>
Becoming a river of abounding floods,<br/>
Which a wide downpour from the lofty hills<br/>
Swells with big showers, dashes headlong down<br/>
Fragments of woodland and whole branching trees;<br/>
Nor can the solid bridges bide the shock<br/>
As on the waters whelm: the turbulent stream,<br/>
Strong with a hundred rains, beats round the piers,<br/>
Crashes with havoc, and rolls beneath its waves<br/>
Down-toppled masonry and ponderous stone,<br/>
Hurling away whatever would oppose.<br/>
Even so must move the blasts of all the winds,<br/>
Which, when they spread, like to a mighty flood,<br/>
Hither or thither, drive things on before<br/>
And hurl to ground with still renewed assault,<br/>
Or sometimes in their circling vortex seize<br/>
And bear in cones of whirlwind down the world:<br/>
The winds are sightless bodies and naught else&mdash;<br/>
Since both in works and ways they rival well<br/>
The mighty rivers, the visible in form.<br/>
Then too we know the varied smells of things<br/>
Yet never to our nostrils see them come;<br/>
With eyes we view not burning heats, nor cold,<br/>
Nor are we wont men's voices to behold.<br/>
Yet these must be corporeal at the base,<br/>
Since thus they smite the senses: naught there is<br/>
Save body, having property of touch.<br/>
And raiment, hung by surf-beat shore, grows moist,<br/>
The same, spread out before the sun, will dry;<br/>
Yet no one saw how sank the moisture in,<br/>
Nor how by heat off-driven. Thus we know,<br/>
That moisture is dispersed about in bits<br/>
Too small for eyes to see. Another case:<br/>
A ring upon the finger thins away<br/>
Along the under side, with years and suns;<br/>
The drippings from the eaves will scoop the stone;<br/>
The hooked ploughshare, though of iron, wastes<br/>
Amid the fields insidiously. We view<br/>
The rock-paved highways worn by many feet;<br/>
And at the gates the brazen statues show<br/>
Their right hands leaner from the frequent touch<br/>
Of wayfarers innumerable who greet.<br/>
We see how wearing-down hath minished these,<br/>
But just what motes depart at any time,<br/>
The envious nature of vision bars our sight.<br/>
Lastly whatever days and nature add<br/>
Little by little, constraining things to grow<br/>
In due proportion, no gaze however keen<br/>
Of these our eyes hath watched and known. No more<br/>
Can we observe what's lost at any time,<br/>
When things wax old with eld and foul decay,<br/>
Or when salt seas eat under beetling crags.<br/>
Thus Nature ever by unseen bodies works.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But yet creation's neither crammed nor blocked<br/>
About by body: there's in things a void&mdash;<br/>
Which to have known will serve thee many a turn,<br/>
Nor will not leave thee wandering in doubt,<br/>
Forever searching in the sum of all,<br/>
And losing faith in these pronouncements mine.<br/>
There's place intangible, a void and room.<br/>
For were it not, things could in nowise move;<br/>
Since body's property to block and check<br/>
Would work on all and at an times the same.<br/>
Thus naught could evermore push forth and go,<br/>
Since naught elsewhere would yield a starting place.<br/>
But now through oceans, lands, and heights of heaven,<br/>
By divers causes and in divers modes,<br/>
Before our eyes we mark how much may move,<br/>
Which, finding not a void, would fail deprived<br/>
Of stir and motion; nay, would then have been<br/>
Nowise begot at all, since matter, then,<br/>
Had staid at rest, its parts together crammed.<br/>
Then too, however solid objects seem,<br/>
They yet are formed of matter mixed with void:<br/>
In rocks and caves the watery moisture seeps,<br/>
And beady drops stand out like plenteous tears;<br/>
And food finds way through every frame that lives;<br/>
The trees increase and yield the season's fruit<br/>
Because their food throughout the whole is poured,<br/>
Even from the deepest roots, through trunks and boughs;<br/>
And voices pass the solid walls and fly<br/>
Reverberant through shut doorways of a house;<br/>
And stiffening frost seeps inward to our bones.<br/>
Which but for voids for bodies to go through<br/>
'Tis clear could happen in nowise at all.<br/>
Again, why see we among objects some<br/>
Of heavier weight, but of no bulkier size?<br/>
Indeed, if in a ball of wool there be<br/>
As much of body as in lump of lead,<br/>
The two should weigh alike, since body tends<br/>
To load things downward, while the void abides,<br/>
By contrary nature, the imponderable.<br/>
Therefore, an object just as large but lighter<br/>
Declares infallibly its more of void;<br/>
Even as the heavier more of matter shows,<br/>
And how much less of vacant room inside.<br/>
That which we're seeking with sagacious quest<br/>
Exists, infallibly, commixed with things&mdash;<br/>
The void, the invisible inane.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right here<br/>
I am compelled a question to expound,<br/>
Forestalling something certain folk suppose,<br/>
Lest it avail to lead thee off from truth:<br/>
Waters (they say) before the shining breed<br/>
Of the swift scaly creatures somehow give,<br/>
And straightway open sudden liquid paths,<br/>
Because the fishes leave behind them room<br/>
To which at once the yielding billows stream.<br/>
Thus things among themselves can yet be moved,<br/>
And change their place, however full the Sum&mdash;<br/>
Received opinion, wholly false forsooth.<br/>
For where can scaly creatures forward dart,<br/>
Save where the waters give them room? Again,<br/>
Where can the billows yield a way, so long<br/>
As ever the fish are powerless to go?<br/>
Thus either all bodies of motion are deprived,<br/>
Or things contain admixture of a void<br/>
Where each thing gets its start in moving on.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Lastly, where after impact two broad bodies<br/>
Suddenly spring apart, the air must crowd<br/>
The whole new void between those bodies formed;<br/>
But air, however it stream with hastening gusts,<br/>
Can yet not fill the gap at once&mdash;for first<br/>
It makes for one place, ere diffused through all.<br/>
And then, if haply any think this comes,<br/>
When bodies spring apart, because the air<br/>
Somehow condenses, wander they from truth:<br/>
For then a void is formed, where none before;<br/>
And, too, a void is filled which was before.<br/>
Nor can air be condensed in such a wise;<br/>
Nor, granting it could, without a void, I hold,<br/>
It still could not contract upon itself<br/>
And draw its parts together into one.<br/>
Wherefore, despite demur and counter-speech,<br/>
Confess thou must there is a void in things.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And still I might by many an argument<br/>
Here scrape together credence for my words.<br/>
But for the keen eye these mere footprints serve,<br/>
Whereby thou mayest know the rest thyself.<br/>
As dogs full oft with noses on the ground,<br/>
Find out the silent lairs, though hid in brush,<br/>
Of beasts, the mountain-rangers, when but once<br/>
They scent the certain footsteps of the way,<br/>
Thus thou thyself in themes like these alone<br/>
Can hunt from thought to thought, and keenly wind<br/>
Along even onward to the secret places<br/>
And drag out truth. But, if thou loiter loth<br/>
Or veer, however little, from the point,<br/>
This I can promise, Memmius, for a fact:<br/>
Such copious drafts my singing tongue shall pour<br/>
From the large well-springs of my plenished breast<br/>
That much I dread slow age will steal and coil<br/>
Along our members, and unloose the gates<br/>
Of life within us, ere for thee my verse<br/>
Hath put within thine ears the stores of proofs<br/>
At hand for one soever question broached.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But, now again to weave the tale begun,<br/>
All nature, then, as self-sustained, consists<br/>
Of twain of things: of bodies and of void<br/>
In which they're set, and where they're moved around.<br/>
For common instinct of our race declares<br/>
That body of itself exists: unless<br/>
This primal faith, deep-founded, fail us not,<br/>
Naught will there be whereunto to appeal<br/>
On things occult when seeking aught to prove<br/>
By reasonings of mind. Again, without<br/>
That place and room, which we do call the inane,<br/>
Nowhere could bodies then be set, nor go<br/>
Hither or thither at all&mdash;as shown before.<br/>
Besides, there's naught of which thou canst declare<br/>
It lives disjoined from body, shut from void&mdash;<br/>
A kind of third in nature. For whatever<br/>
Exists must be a somewhat; and the same,<br/>
If tangible, however fight and slight,<br/>
Will yet increase the count of body's sum,<br/>
With its own augmentation big or small;<br/>
But, if intangible and powerless ever<br/>
To keep a thing from passing through itself<br/>
On any side, 'twill be naught else but that<br/>
Which we do call the empty, the inane.<br/>
Again, whate'er exists, as of itself,<br/>
Must either act or suffer action on it,<br/>
Or else be that wherein things move and be:<br/>
Naught, saving body, acts, is acted on;<br/>
Naught but the inane can furnish room. And thus,<br/>
Beside the inane and bodies, is no third<br/>
Nature amid the number of all things&mdash;<br/>
Remainder none to fall at any time<br/>
Under our senses, nor be seized and seen<br/>
By any man through reasonings of mind.<br/>
Name o'er creation with what names thou wilt,<br/>
Thou'lt find but properties of those first twain,<br/>
Or see but accidents those twain produce.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A property is that which not at all<br/>
Can be disjoined and severed from a thing<br/>
Without a fatal dissolution: such,<br/>
Weight to the rocks, heat to the fire, and flow<br/>
To the wide waters, touch to corporal things,<br/>
Intangibility to the viewless void.<br/>
But state of slavery, pauperhood, and wealth,<br/>
Freedom, and war, and concord, and all else<br/>
Which come and go whilst nature stands the same,<br/>
We're wont, and rightly, to call accidents.<br/>
Even time exists not of itself; but sense<br/>
Reads out of things what happened long ago,<br/>
What presses now, and what shall follow after:<br/>
No man, we must admit, feels time itself,<br/>
Disjoined from motion and repose of things.<br/>
Thus, when they say there "is" the ravishment<br/>
Of Princess Helen, "is" the siege and sack<br/>
Of Trojan Town, look out, they force us not<br/>
To admit these acts existent by themselves,<br/>
Merely because those races of mankind<br/>
(Of whom these acts were accidents) long since<br/>
Irrevocable age has borne away:<br/>
For all past actions may be said to be<br/>
But accidents, in one way, of mankind,&mdash;<br/>
In other, of some region of the world.<br/>
Add, too, had been no matter, and no room<br/>
Wherein all things go on, the fire of love<br/>
Upblown by that fair form, the glowing coal<br/>
Under the Phrygian Alexander's breast,<br/>
Had ne'er enkindled that renowned strife<br/>
Of savage war, nor had the wooden horse<br/>
Involved in flames old Pergama, by a birth<br/>
At midnight of a brood of the Hellenes.<br/>
And thus thou canst remark that every act<br/>
At bottom exists not of itself, nor is<br/>
As body is, nor has like name with void;<br/>
But rather of sort more fitly to be called<br/>
An accident of body, and of place<br/>
Wherein all things go on.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bodies, again,<br/>
Are partly primal germs of things, and partly<br/>
Unions deriving from the primal germs.<br/>
And those which are the primal germs of things<br/>
No power can quench; for in the end they conquer<br/>
By their own solidness; though hard it be<br/>
To think that aught in things has solid frame;<br/>
For lightnings pass, no less than voice and shout,<br/>
Through hedging walls of houses, and the iron<br/>
White-dazzles in the fire, and rocks will burn<br/>
With exhalations fierce and burst asunder.<br/>
Totters the rigid gold dissolved in heat;<br/>
The ice of bronze melts conquered in the flame;<br/>
Warmth and the piercing cold through silver seep,<br/>
Since, with the cups held rightly in the hand,<br/>
We oft feel both, as from above is poured<br/>
The dew of waters between their shining sides:<br/>
So true it is no solid form is found.<br/>
But yet because true reason and nature of things<br/>
Constrain us, come, whilst in few verses now<br/>
I disentangle how there still exist<br/>
Bodies of solid, everlasting frame&mdash;<br/>
The seeds of things, the primal germs we teach,<br/>
Whence all creation around us came to be.<br/>
First since we know a twofold nature exists,<br/>
Of things, both twain and utterly unlike&mdash;<br/>
Body, and place in which an things go on&mdash;<br/>
Then each must be both for and through itself,<br/>
And all unmixed: where'er be empty space,<br/>
There body's not; and so where body bides,<br/>
There not at all exists the void inane.<br/>
Thus primal bodies are solid, without a void.<br/>
But since there's void in all begotten things,<br/>
All solid matter must be round the same;<br/>
Nor, by true reason canst thou prove aught hides<br/>
And holds a void within its body, unless<br/>
Thou grant what holds it be a solid. Know,<br/>
That which can hold a void of things within<br/>
Can be naught else than matter in union knit.<br/>
Thus matter, consisting of a solid frame,<br/>
Hath power to be eternal, though all else,<br/>
Though all creation, be dissolved away.<br/>
Again, were naught of empty and inane,<br/>
The world were then a solid; as, without<br/>
Some certain bodies to fill the places held,<br/>
The world that is were but a vacant void.<br/>
And so, infallibly, alternate-wise<br/>
Body and void are still distinguished,<br/>
Since nature knows no wholly full nor void.<br/>
There are, then, certain bodies, possessed of power<br/>
To vary forever the empty and the full;<br/>
And these can nor be sundered from without<br/>
By beats and blows, nor from within be torn<br/>
By penetration, nor be overthrown<br/>
By any assault soever through the world&mdash;<br/>
For without void, naught can be crushed, it seems,<br/>
Nor broken, nor severed by a cut in twain,<br/>
Nor can it take the damp, or seeping cold<br/>
Or piercing fire, those old destroyers three;<br/>
But the more void within a thing, the more<br/>
Entirely it totters at their sure assault.<br/>
Thus if first bodies be, as I have taught,<br/>
Solid, without a void, they must be then<br/>
Eternal; and, if matter ne'er had been<br/>
Eternal, long ere now had all things gone<br/>
Back into nothing utterly, and all<br/>
We see around from nothing had been born&mdash;<br/>
But since I taught above that naught can be<br/>
From naught created, nor the once begotten<br/>
To naught be summoned back, these primal germs<br/>
Must have an immortality of frame.<br/>
And into these must each thing be resolved,<br/>
When comes its supreme hour, that thus there be<br/>
At hand the stuff for plenishing the world.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So primal germs have solid singleness<br/>
Nor otherwise could they have been conserved<br/>
Through aeons and infinity of time<br/>
For the replenishment of wasted worlds.<br/>
Once more, if nature had given a scope for things<br/>
To be forever broken more and more,<br/>
By now the bodies of matter would have been<br/>
So far reduced by breakings in old days<br/>
That from them nothing could, at season fixed,<br/>
Be born, and arrive its prime and top of life.<br/>
For, lo, each thing is quicker marred than made;<br/>
And so whate'er the long infinitude<br/>
Of days and all fore-passed time would now<br/>
By this have broken and ruined and dissolved,<br/>
That same could ne'er in all remaining time<br/>
Be builded up for plenishing the world.<br/>
But mark: infallibly a fixed bound<br/>
Remaineth stablished 'gainst their breaking down;<br/>
Since we behold each thing soever renewed,<br/>
And unto all, their seasons, after their kind,<br/>
Wherein they arrive the flower of their age.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Again, if bounds have not been set against<br/>
The breaking down of this corporeal world,<br/>
Yet must all bodies of whatever things<br/>
Have still endured from everlasting time<br/>
Unto this present, as not yet assailed<br/>
By shocks of peril. But because the same<br/>
Are, to thy thinking, of a nature frail,<br/>
It ill accords that thus they could remain<br/>
(As thus they do) through everlasting time,<br/>
Vexed through the ages (as indeed they are)<br/>
By the innumerable blows of chance.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So in our programme of creation, mark<br/>
How 'tis that, though the bodies of all stuff<br/>
Are solid to the core, we yet explain<br/>
The ways whereby some things are fashioned soft&mdash;<br/>
Air, water, earth, and fiery exhalations&mdash;<br/>
And by what force they function and go on:<br/>
The fact is founded in the void of things.<br/>
But if the primal germs themselves be soft,<br/>
Reason cannot be brought to bear to show<br/>
The ways whereby may be created these<br/>
Great crags of basalt and the during iron;<br/>
For their whole nature will profoundly lack<br/>
The first foundations of a solid frame.<br/>
But powerful in old simplicity,<br/>
Abide the solid, the primeval germs;<br/>
And by their combinations more condensed,<br/>
All objects can be tightly knit and bound<br/>
And made to show unconquerable strength.<br/>
Again, since all things kind by kind obtain<br/>
Fixed bounds of growing and conserving life;<br/>
Since Nature hath inviolably decreed<br/>
What each can do, what each can never do;<br/>
Since naught is changed, but all things so abide<br/>
That ever the variegated birds reveal<br/>
The spots or stripes peculiar to their kind,<br/>
Spring after spring: thus surely all that is<br/>
Must be composed of matter immutable.<br/>
For if the primal germs in any wise<br/>
Were open to conquest and to change, 'twould be<br/>
Uncertain also what could come to birth<br/>
And what could not, and by what law to each<br/>
Its scope prescribed, its boundary stone that clings<br/>
So deep in Time. Nor could the generations<br/>
Kind after kind so often reproduce<br/>
The nature, habits, motions, ways of life,<br/>
Of their progenitors.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then again,<br/>
Since there is ever an extreme bounding point<br/>
Of that first body which our senses now<br/>
Cannot perceive: That bounding point indeed<br/>
Exists without all parts, a minimum<br/>
Of nature, nor was e'er a thing apart,<br/>
As of itself,&mdash;nor shall hereafter be,<br/>
Since 'tis itself still parcel of another,<br/>
A first and single part, whence other parts<br/>
And others similar in order lie<br/>
In a packed phalanx, filling to the full<br/>
The nature of first body: being thus<br/>
Not self-existent, they must cleave to that<br/>
From which in nowise they can sundered be.<br/>
So primal germs have solid singleness,<br/>
Which tightly packed and closely joined cohere<br/>
By virtue of their minim particles&mdash;<br/>
No compound by mere union of the same;<br/>
But strong in their eternal singleness,<br/>
Nature, reserving them as seeds for things,<br/>
Permitteth naught of rupture or decrease.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Moreover, were there not a minimum,<br/>
The smallest bodies would have infinites,<br/>
Since then a half-of-half could still be halved,<br/>
With limitless division less and less.<br/>
Then what the difference 'twixt the sum and least?<br/>
None: for however infinite the sum,<br/>
Yet even the smallest would consist the same<br/>
Of infinite parts. But since true reason here<br/>
Protests, denying that the mind can think it,<br/>
Convinced thou must confess such things there are<br/>
As have no parts, the minimums of nature.<br/>
And since these are, likewise confess thou must<br/>
That primal bodies are solid and eterne.<br/>
Again, if Nature, creatress of all things,<br/>
Were wont to force all things to be resolved<br/>
Unto least parts, then would she not avail<br/>
To reproduce from out them anything;<br/>
Because whate'er is not endowed with parts<br/>
Cannot possess those properties required<br/>
Of generative stuff&mdash;divers connections,<br/>
Weights, blows, encounters, motions, whereby things<br/>
Forevermore have being and go on.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And on such grounds it is that those who held<br/>
The stuff of things is fire, and out of fire<br/>
Alone the cosmic sum is formed, are seen<br/>
Mightily from true reason to have lapsed.<br/>
Of whom, chief leader to do battle, comes<br/>
That Heraclitus, famous for dark speech<br/>
Among the silly, not the serious Greeks<br/>
Who search for truth. For dolts are ever prone<br/>
That to bewonder and adore which hides<br/>
Beneath distorted words, holding that true<br/>
Which sweetly tickles in their stupid ears,<br/>
Or which is rouged in finely finished phrase.<br/>
For how, I ask, can things so varied be,<br/>
If formed of fire, single and pure? No whit<br/>
'Twould help for fire to be condensed or thinned,<br/>
If all the parts of fire did still preserve<br/>
But fire's own nature, seen before in gross.<br/>
The heat were keener with the parts compressed,<br/>
Milder, again, when severed or dispersed&mdash;<br/>
And more than this thou canst conceive of naught<br/>
That from such causes could become; much less<br/>
Might earth's variety of things be born<br/>
From any fires soever, dense or rare.<br/>
This too: if they suppose a void in things,<br/>
Then fires can be condensed and still left rare;<br/>
But since they see such opposites of thought<br/>
Rising against them, and are loath to leave<br/>
An unmixed void in things, they fear the steep<br/>
And lose the road of truth. Nor do they see,<br/>
That, if from things we take away the void,<br/>
All things are then condensed, and out of all<br/>
One body made, which has no power to dart<br/>
Swiftly from out itself not anything&mdash;<br/>
As throws the fire its light and warmth around,<br/>
Giving thee proof its parts are not compact.<br/>
But if perhaps they think, in other wise,<br/>
Fires through their combinations can be quenched<br/>
And change their substance, very well: behold,<br/>
If fire shall spare to do so in no part,<br/>
Then heat will perish utterly and all,<br/>
And out of nothing would the world be formed.<br/>
For change in anything from out its bounds<br/>
Means instant death of that which was before;<br/>
And thus a somewhat must persist unharmed<br/>
Amid the world, lest all return to naught,<br/>
And, born from naught, abundance thrive anew.<br/>
Now since indeed there are those surest bodies<br/>
Which keep their nature evermore the same,<br/>
Upon whose going out and coming in<br/>
And changed order things their nature change,<br/>
And all corporeal substances transformed,<br/>
'Tis thine to know those primal bodies, then,<br/>
Are not of fire. For 'twere of no avail<br/>
Should some depart and go away, and some<br/>
Be added new, and some be changed in order,<br/>
If still all kept their nature of old heat:<br/>
For whatsoever they created then<br/>
Would still in any case be only fire.<br/>
The truth, I fancy, this: bodies there are<br/>
Whose clashings, motions, order, posture, shapes<br/>
Produce the fire and which, by order changed,<br/>
Do change the nature of the thing produced,<br/>
And are thereafter nothing like to fire<br/>
Nor whatso else has power to send its bodies<br/>
With impact touching on the senses' touch.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Again, to say that all things are but fire<br/>
And no true thing in number of all things<br/>
Exists but fire, as this same fellow says,<br/>
Seems crazed folly. For the man himself<br/>
Against the senses by the senses fights,<br/>
And hews at that through which is all belief,<br/>
Through which indeed unto himself is known<br/>
The thing he calls the fire. For, though he thinks<br/>
The senses truly can perceive the fire,<br/>
He thinks they cannot as regards all else,<br/>
Which still are palpably as clear to sense&mdash;<br/>
To me a thought inept and crazy too.<br/>
For whither shall we make appeal? for what<br/>
More certain than our senses can there be<br/>
Whereby to mark asunder error and truth?<br/>
Besides, why rather do away with all,<br/>
And wish to allow heat only, then deny<br/>
The fire and still allow all else to be?&mdash;<br/>
Alike the madness either way it seems.<br/>
Thus whosoe'er have held the stuff of things<br/>
To be but fire, and out of fire the sum,<br/>
And whosoever have constituted air<br/>
As first beginning of begotten things,<br/>
And all whoever have held that of itself<br/>
Water alone contrives things, or that earth<br/>
Createth all and changes things anew<br/>
To divers natures, mightily they seem<br/>
A long way to have wandered from the truth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Add, too, whoever make the primal stuff<br/>
Twofold, by joining air to fire, and earth<br/>
To water; add who deem that things can grow<br/>
Out of the four&mdash;fire, earth, and breath, and rain;<br/>
As first Empedocles of Acragas,<br/>
Whom that three-cornered isle of all the lands<br/>
Bore on her coasts, around which flows and flows<br/>
In mighty bend and bay the Ionic seas,<br/>
Splashing the brine from off their gray-green waves.<br/>
Here, billowing onward through the narrow straits,<br/>
Swift ocean cuts her boundaries from the shores<br/>
Of the Italic mainland. Here the waste<br/>
Charybdis; and here Aetna rumbles threats<br/>
To gather anew such furies of its flames<br/>
As with its force anew to vomit fires,<br/>
Belched from its throat, and skyward bear anew<br/>
Its lightnings' flash. And though for much she seem<br/>
The mighty and the wondrous isle to men,<br/>
Most rich in all good things, and fortified<br/>
With generous strength of heroes, she hath ne'er<br/>
Possessed within her aught of more renown,<br/>
Nor aught more holy, wonderful, and dear<br/>
Than this true man. Nay, ever so far and pure<br/>
The lofty music of his breast divine<br/>
Lifts up its voice and tells of glories found,<br/>
That scarce he seems of human stock create.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yet he and those forementioned (known to be<br/>
So far beneath him, less than he in all),<br/>
Though, as discoverers of much goodly truth,<br/>
They gave, as 'twere from out of the heart's own shrine,<br/>
Responses holier and soundlier based<br/>
Than ever the Pythia pronounced for men<br/>
From out the triped and the Delphian laurel,<br/>
Have still in matter of first-elements<br/>
Made ruin of themselves, and, great men, great<br/>
Indeed and heavy there for them the fall:<br/>
First, because, banishing the void from things,<br/>
They yet assign them motion, and allow<br/>
Things soft and loosely textured to exist,<br/>
As air, dew, fire, earth, animals, and grains,<br/>
Without admixture of void amid their frame.<br/>
Next, because, thinking there can be no end<br/>
In cutting bodies down to less and less<br/>
Nor pause established to their breaking up,<br/>
They hold there is no minimum in things;<br/>
Albeit we see the boundary point of aught<br/>
Is that which to our senses seems its least,<br/>
Whereby thou mayst conjecture, that, because<br/>
The things thou canst not mark have boundary points,<br/>
They surely have their minimums. Then, too,<br/>
Since these philosophers ascribe to things<br/>
Soft primal germs, which we behold to be<br/>
Of birth and body mortal, thus, throughout,<br/>
The sum of things must be returned to naught,<br/>
And, born from naught, abundance thrive anew&mdash;<br/>
Thou seest how far each doctrine stands from truth.<br/>
And, next, these bodies are among themselves<br/>
In many ways poisons and foes to each,<br/>
Wherefore their congress will destroy them quite<br/>
Or drive asunder as we see in storms<br/>
Rains, winds, and lightnings all asunder fly.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus too, if all things are create of four,<br/>
And all again dissolved into the four,<br/>
How can the four be called the primal germs<br/>
Of things, more than all things themselves be thought,<br/>
By retroversion, primal germs of them?<br/>
For ever alternately are both begot,<br/>
With interchange of nature and aspect<br/>
From immemorial time. But if percase<br/>
Thou think'st the frame of fire and earth, the air,<br/>
The dew of water can in such wise meet<br/>
As not by mingling to resign their nature,<br/>
From them for thee no world can be create&mdash;<br/>
No thing of breath, no stock or stalk of tree:<br/>
In the wild congress of this varied heap<br/>
Each thing its proper nature will display,<br/>
And air will palpably be seen mixed up<br/>
With earth together, unquenched heat with water.<br/>
But primal germs in bringing things to birth<br/>
Must have a latent, unseen quality,<br/>
Lest some outstanding alien element<br/>
Confuse and minish in the thing create<br/>
Its proper being.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these men begin<br/>
From heaven, and from its fires; and first they feign<br/>
That fire will turn into the winds of air,<br/>
Next, that from air the rain begotten is,<br/>
And earth created out of rain, and then<br/>
That all, reversely, are returned from earth&mdash;<br/>
The moisture first, then air thereafter heat&mdash;<br/>
And that these same ne'er cease in interchange,<br/>
To go their ways from heaven to earth, from earth<br/>
Unto the stars of the aethereal world&mdash;<br/>
Which in no wise at all the germs can do.<br/>
Since an immutable somewhat still must be,<br/>
Lest all things utterly be sped to naught;<br/>
For change in anything from out its bounds<br/>
Means instant death of that which was before.<br/>
Wherefore, since those things, mentioned heretofore,<br/>
Suffer a changed state, they must derive<br/>
From others ever unconvertible,<br/>
Lest an things utterly return to naught.<br/>
Then why not rather presuppose there be<br/>
Bodies with such a nature furnished forth<br/>
That, if perchance they have created fire,<br/>
Can still (by virtue of a few withdrawn,<br/>
Or added few, and motion and order changed)<br/>
Fashion the winds of air, and thus all things<br/>
Forevermore be interchanged with all?<br/>
</p>
<p>
"But facts in proof are manifest," thou sayest,<br/>
"That all things grow into the winds of air<br/>
And forth from earth are nourished, and unless<br/>
The season favour at propitious hour<br/>
With rains enough to set the trees a-reel<br/>
Under the soak of bulking thunderheads,<br/>
And sun, for its share, foster and give heat,<br/>
No grains, nor trees, nor breathing things can grow."<br/>
True&mdash;and unless hard food and moisture soft<br/>
Recruited man, his frame would waste away,<br/>
And life dissolve from out his thews and bones;<br/>
For out of doubt recruited and fed are we<br/>
By certain things, as other things by others.<br/>
Because in many ways the many germs<br/>
Common to many things are mixed in things,<br/>
No wonder 'tis that therefore divers things<br/>
By divers things are nourished. And, again,<br/>
Often it matters vastly with what others,<br/>
In what positions the primordial germs<br/>
Are bound together, and what motions, too,<br/>
They give and get among themselves; for these<br/>
Same germs do put together sky, sea, lands,<br/>
Rivers, and sun, grains, trees, and breathing things,<br/>
But yet commixed they are in divers modes<br/>
With divers things, forever as they move.<br/>
Nay, thou beholdest in our verses here<br/>
Elements many, common to many worlds,<br/>
Albeit thou must confess each verse, each word<br/>
From one another differs both in sense<br/>
And ring of sound&mdash;so much the elements<br/>
Can bring about by change of order alone.<br/>
But those which are the primal germs of things<br/>
Have power to work more combinations still,<br/>
Whence divers things can be produced in turn.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now let us also take for scrutiny<br/>
The homeomeria of Anaxagoras,<br/>
So called by Greeks, for which our pauper-speech<br/>
Yieldeth no name in the Italian tongue,<br/>
Although the thing itself is not o'erhard<br/>
For explanation. First, then, when he speaks<br/>
Of this homeomeria of things, he thinks<br/>
Bones to be sprung from littlest bones minute,<br/>
And from minute and littlest flesh all flesh,<br/>
And blood created out of drops of blood,<br/>
Conceiving gold compact of grains of gold,<br/>
And earth concreted out of bits of earth,<br/>
Fire made of fires, and water out of waters,<br/>
Feigning the like with all the rest of stuff.<br/>
Yet he concedes not any void in things,<br/>
Nor any limit to cutting bodies down.<br/>
Wherefore to me he seems on both accounts<br/>
To err no less than those we named before.<br/>
Add too: these germs he feigns are far too frail&mdash;<br/>
If they be germs primordial furnished forth<br/>
With but same nature as the things themselves,<br/>
And travail and perish equally with those,<br/>
And no rein curbs them from annihilation.<br/>
For which will last against the grip and crush<br/>
Under the teeth of death? the fire? the moist?<br/>
Or else the air? which then? the blood? the bones?<br/>
No one, methinks, when every thing will be<br/>
At bottom as mortal as whate'er we mark<br/>
To perish by force before our gazing eyes.<br/>
But my appeal is to the proofs above<br/>
That things cannot fall back to naught, nor yet<br/>
From naught increase. And now again, since food<br/>
Augments and nourishes the human frame,<br/>
'Tis thine to know our veins and blood and bones<br/>
And thews are formed of particles unlike<br/>
To them in kind; or if they say all foods<br/>
Are of mixed substance having in themselves<br/>
Small bodies of thews, and bones, and also veins<br/>
And particles of blood, then every food,<br/>
Solid or liquid, must itself be thought<br/>
As made and mixed of things unlike in kind&mdash;<br/>
Of bones, of thews, of ichor and of blood.<br/>
Again, if all the bodies which upgrow<br/>
From earth, are first within the earth, then earth<br/>
Must be compound of alien substances.<br/>
Which spring and bloom abroad from out the earth.<br/>
Transfer the argument, and thou may'st use<br/>
The selfsame words: if flame and smoke and ash<br/>
Still lurk unseen within the wood, the wood<br/>
Must be compound of alien substances<br/>
Which spring from out the wood.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right here remains<br/>
A certain slender means to skulk from truth,<br/>
Which Anaxagoras takes unto himself,<br/>
Who holds that all things lurk commixed with all<br/>
While that one only comes to view, of which<br/>
The bodies exceed in number all the rest,<br/>
And lie more close to hand and at the fore&mdash;<br/>
A notion banished from true reason far.<br/>
For then 'twere meet that kernels of the grains<br/>
Should oft, when crunched between the might of stones,<br/>
Give forth a sign of blood, or of aught else<br/>
Which in our human frame is fed; and that<br/>
Rock rubbed on rock should yield a gory ooze.<br/>
Likewise the herbs ought oft to give forth drops<br/>
Of sweet milk, flavoured like the uddered sheep's;<br/>
Indeed we ought to find, when crumbling up<br/>
The earthy clods, there herbs, and grains, and leaves,<br/>
All sorts dispersed minutely in the soil;<br/>
Lastly we ought to find in cloven wood<br/>
Ashes and smoke and bits of fire there hid.<br/>
But since fact teaches this is not the case,<br/>
'Tis thine to know things are not mixed with things<br/>
Thuswise; but seeds, common to many things,<br/>
Commixed in many ways, must lurk in things.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"But often it happens on skiey hills" thou sayest,<br/>
"That neighbouring tops of lofty trees are rubbed<br/>
One against other, smote by the blustering south,<br/>
Till all ablaze with bursting flower of flame."<br/>
Good sooth&mdash;yet fire is not ingraft in wood,<br/>
But many are the seeds of heat, and when<br/>
Rubbing together they together flow,<br/>
They start the conflagrations in the forests.<br/>
Whereas if flame, already fashioned, lay<br/>
Stored up within the forests, then the fires<br/>
Could not for any time be kept unseen,<br/>
But would be laying all the wildwood waste<br/>
And burning all the boscage. Now dost see<br/>
(Even as we said a little space above)<br/>
How mightily it matters with what others,<br/>
In what positions these same primal germs<br/>
Are bound together? And what motions, too,<br/>
They give and get among themselves? how, hence,<br/>
The same, if altered 'mongst themselves, can body<br/>
Both igneous and ligneous objects forth&mdash;<br/>
Precisely as these words themselves are made<br/>
By somewhat altering their elements,<br/>
Although we mark with name indeed distinct<br/>
The igneous from the ligneous. Once again,<br/>
If thou suppose whatever thou beholdest,<br/>
Among all visible objects, cannot be,<br/>
Unless thou feign bodies of matter endowed<br/>
With a like nature,&mdash;by thy vain device<br/>
For thee will perish all the germs of things:<br/>
'Twill come to pass they'll laugh aloud, like men,<br/>
Shaken asunder by a spasm of mirth,<br/>
Or moisten with salty tear-drops cheeks and chins.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now learn of what remains! More keenly hear!<br/>
And for myself, my mind is not deceived<br/>
How dark it is: But the large hope of praise<br/>
Hath strook with pointed thyrsus through my heart;<br/>
On the same hour hath strook into my breast<br/>
Sweet love of the Muses, wherewith now instinct,<br/>
I wander afield, thriving in sturdy thought,<br/>
Through unpathed haunts of the Pierides,<br/>
Trodden by step of none before. I joy<br/>
To come on undefiled fountains there,<br/>
To drain them deep; I joy to pluck new flowers,<br/>
To seek for this my head a signal crown<br/>
From regions where the Muses never yet<br/>
Have garlanded the temples of a man:<br/>
First, since I teach concerning mighty things,<br/>
And go right on to loose from round the mind<br/>
The tightened coils of dread religion;<br/>
Next, since, concerning themes so dark, I frame<br/>
Songs so pellucid, touching all throughout<br/>
Even with the Muses' charm&mdash;which, as 'twould seem,<br/>
Is not without a reasonable ground:<br/>
But as physicians, when they seek to give<br/>
Young boys the nauseous wormwood, first do touch<br/>
The brim around the cup with the sweet juice<br/>
And yellow of the honey, in order that<br/>
The thoughtless age of boyhood be cajoled<br/>
As far as the lips, and meanwhile swallow down<br/>
The wormwood's bitter draught, and, though befooled,<br/>
Be yet not merely duped, but rather thus<br/>
Grow strong again with recreated health:<br/>
So now I too (since this my doctrine seems<br/>
In general somewhat woeful unto those<br/>
Who've had it not in hand, and since the crowd<br/>
Starts back from it in horror) have desired<br/>
To expound our doctrine unto thee in song<br/>
Soft-speaking and Pierian, and, as 'twere,<br/>
To touch it with sweet honey of the Muse&mdash;<br/>
If by such method haply I might hold<br/>
The mind of thee upon these lines of ours,<br/>
Till thou see through the nature of all things,<br/>
And how exists the interwoven frame.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But since I've taught that bodies of matter, made<br/>
Completely solid, hither and thither fly<br/>
Forevermore unconquered through all time,<br/>
Now come, and whether to the sum of them<br/>
There be a limit or be none, for thee<br/>
Let us unfold; likewise what has been found<br/>
To be the wide inane, or room, or space<br/>
Wherein all things soever do go on,<br/>
Let us examine if it finite be<br/>
All and entire, or reach unmeasured round<br/>
And downward an illimitable profound.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus, then, the All that is is limited<br/>
In no one region of its onward paths,<br/>
For then 'tmust have forever its beyond.<br/>
And a beyond 'tis seen can never be<br/>
For aught, unless still further on there be<br/>
A somewhat somewhere that may bound the same&mdash;<br/>
So that the thing be seen still on to where<br/>
The nature of sensation of that thing<br/>
Can follow it no longer. Now because<br/>
Confess we must there's naught beside the sum,<br/>
There's no beyond, and so it lacks all end.<br/>
It matters nothing where thou post thyself,<br/>
In whatsoever regions of the same;<br/>
Even any place a man has set him down<br/>
Still leaves about him the unbounded all<br/>
Outward in all directions; or, supposing<br/>
A moment the all of space finite to be,<br/>
If some one farthest traveller runs forth<br/>
Unto the extreme coasts and throws ahead<br/>
A flying spear, is't then thy wish to think<br/>
It goes, hurled off amain, to where 'twas sent<br/>
And shoots afar, or that some object there<br/>
Can thwart and stop it? For the one or other<br/>
Thou must admit and take. Either of which<br/>
Shuts off escape for thee, and does compel<br/>
That thou concede the all spreads everywhere,<br/>
Owning no confines. Since whether there be<br/>
Aught that may block and check it so it comes<br/>
Not where 'twas sent, nor lodges in its goal,<br/>
Or whether borne along, in either view<br/>
'Thas started not from any end. And so<br/>
I'll follow on, and whereso'er thou set<br/>
The extreme coasts, I'll query, "what becomes<br/>
Thereafter of thy spear?" 'Twill come to pass<br/>
That nowhere can a world's-end be, and that<br/>
The chance for further flight prolongs forever<br/>
The flight itself. Besides, were all the space<br/>
Of the totality and sum shut in<br/>
With fixed coasts, and bounded everywhere,<br/>
Then would the abundance of world's matter flow<br/>
Together by solid weight from everywhere<br/>
Still downward to the bottom of the world,<br/>
Nor aught could happen under cope of sky,<br/>
Nor could there be a sky at all or sun&mdash;<br/>
Indeed, where matter all one heap would lie,<br/>
By having settled during infinite time.<br/>
But in reality, repose is given<br/>
Unto no bodies 'mongst the elements,<br/>
Because there is no bottom whereunto<br/>
They might, as 'twere, together flow, and where<br/>
They might take up their undisturbed abodes.<br/>
In endless motion everything goes on<br/>
Forevermore; out of all regions, even<br/>
Out of the pit below, from forth the vast,<br/>
Are hurtled bodies evermore supplied.<br/>
The nature of room, the space of the abyss<br/>
Is such that even the flashing thunderbolts<br/>
Can neither speed upon their courses through,<br/>
Gliding across eternal tracts of time,<br/>
Nor, further, bring to pass, as on they run,<br/>
That they may bate their journeying one whit:<br/>
Such huge abundance spreads for things around&mdash;<br/>
Room off to every quarter, without end.<br/>
Lastly, before our very eyes is seen<br/>
Thing to bound thing: air hedges hill from hill,<br/>
And mountain walls hedge air; land ends the sea,<br/>
And sea in turn all lands; but for the All<br/>
Truly is nothing which outside may bound.<br/>
That, too, the sum of things itself may not<br/>
Have power to fix a measure of its own,<br/>
Great nature guards, she who compels the void<br/>
To bound all body, as body all the void,<br/>
Thus rendering by these alternates the whole<br/>
An infinite; or else the one or other,<br/>
Being unbounded by the other, spreads,<br/>
Even by its single nature, ne'ertheless<br/>
Immeasurably forth....<br/>
Nor sea, nor earth, nor shining vaults of sky,<br/>
Nor breed of mortals, nor holy limbs of gods<br/>
Could keep their place least portion of an hour:<br/>
For, driven apart from out its meetings fit,<br/>
The stock of stuff, dissolved, would be borne<br/>
Along the illimitable inane afar,<br/>
Or rather, in fact, would ne'er have once combined<br/>
And given a birth to aught, since, scattered wide,<br/>
It could not be united. For of truth<br/>
Neither by counsel did the primal germs<br/>
'Stablish themselves, as by keen act of mind,<br/>
Each in its proper place; nor did they make,<br/>
Forsooth, a compact how each germ should move;<br/>
But since, being many and changed in many modes<br/>
Along the All, they're driven abroad and vexed<br/>
By blow on blow, even from all time of old,<br/>
They thus at last, after attempting all<br/>
The kinds of motion and conjoining, come<br/>
Into those great arrangements out of which<br/>
This sum of things established is create,<br/>
By which, moreover, through the mighty years,<br/>
It is preserved, when once it has been thrown<br/>
Into the proper motions, bringing to pass<br/>
That ever the streams refresh the greedy main<br/>
With river-waves abounding, and that earth,<br/>
Lapped in warm exhalations of the sun,<br/>
Renews her broods, and that the lusty race<br/>
Of breathing creatures bears and blooms, and that<br/>
The gliding fires of ether are alive&mdash;<br/>
What still the primal germs nowise could do,<br/>
Unless from out the infinite of space<br/>
Could come supply of matter, whence in season<br/>
They're wont whatever losses to repair.<br/>
For as the nature of breathing creatures wastes,<br/>
Losing its body, when deprived of food:<br/>
So all things have to be dissolved as soon<br/>
As matter, diverted by what means soever<br/>
From off its course, shall fail to be on hand.<br/>
Nor can the blows from outward still conserve,<br/>
On every side, whatever sum of a world<br/>
Has been united in a whole. They can<br/>
Indeed, by frequent beating, check a part,<br/>
Till others arriving may fulfil the sum;<br/>
But meanwhile often are they forced to spring<br/>
Rebounding back, and, as they spring, to yield,<br/>
Unto those elements whence a world derives,<br/>
Room and a time for flight, permitting them<br/>
To be from off the massy union borne<br/>
Free and afar. Wherefore, again, again:<br/>
Needs must there come a many for supply;<br/>
And also, that the blows themselves shall be<br/>
Unfailing ever, must there ever be<br/>
An infinite force of matter all sides round.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And in these problems, shrink, my Memmius, far<br/>
From yielding faith to that notorious talk:<br/>
That all things inward to the centre press;<br/>
And thus the nature of the world stands firm<br/>
With never blows from outward, nor can be<br/>
Nowhere disparted&mdash;since all height and depth<br/>
Have always inward to the centre pressed<br/>
(If thou art ready to believe that aught<br/>
Itself can rest upon itself ); or that<br/>
The ponderous bodies which be under earth<br/>
Do all press upwards and do come to rest<br/>
Upon the earth, in some way upside down,<br/>
Like to those images of things we see<br/>
At present through the waters. They contend,<br/>
With like procedure, that all breathing things<br/>
Head downward roam about, and yet cannot<br/>
Tumble from earth to realms of sky below,<br/>
No more than these our bodies wing away<br/>
Spontaneously to vaults of sky above;<br/>
That, when those creatures look upon the sun,<br/>
We view the constellations of the night;<br/>
And that with us the seasons of the sky<br/>
They thus alternately divide, and thus<br/>
Do pass the night coequal to our days,<br/>
But a vain error has given these dreams to fools,<br/>
Which they've embraced with reasoning perverse<br/>
For centre none can be where world is still<br/>
Boundless, nor yet, if now a centre were,<br/>
Could aught take there a fixed position more<br/>
Than for some other cause 'tmight be dislodged.<br/>
For all of room and space we call the void<br/>
Must both through centre and non-centre yield<br/>
Alike to weights where'er their motions tend.<br/>
Nor is there any place, where, when they've come,<br/>
Bodies can be at standstill in the void,<br/>
Deprived of force of weight; nor yet may void<br/>
Furnish support to any,&mdash;nay, it must,<br/>
True to its bent of nature, still give way.<br/>
Thus in such manner not at all can things<br/>
Be held in union, as if overcome<br/>
By craving for a centre.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But besides,<br/>
Seeing they feign that not all bodies press<br/>
To centre inward, rather only those<br/>
Of earth and water (liquid of the sea,<br/>
And the big billows from the mountain slopes,<br/>
And whatsoever are encased, as 'twere,<br/>
In earthen body), contrariwise, they teach<br/>
How the thin air, and with it the hot fire,<br/>
Is borne asunder from the centre, and how,<br/>
For this all ether quivers with bright stars,<br/>
And the sun's flame along the blue is fed<br/>
(Because the heat, from out the centre flying,<br/>
All gathers there), and how, again, the boughs<br/>
Upon the tree-tops could not sprout their leaves,<br/>
Unless, little by little, from out the earth<br/>
For each were nutriment...<br/>
</p>
<p>
Lest, after the manner of the winged flames,<br/>
The ramparts of the world should flee away,<br/>
Dissolved amain throughout the mighty void,<br/>
And lest all else should likewise follow after,<br/>
Aye, lest the thundering vaults of heaven should burst<br/>
And splinter upward, and the earth forthwith<br/>
Withdraw from under our feet, and all its bulk,<br/>
Among its mingled wrecks and those of heaven,<br/>
With slipping asunder of the primal seeds,<br/>
Should pass, along the immeasurable inane,<br/>
Away forever, and, that instant, naught<br/>
Of wrack and remnant would be left, beside<br/>
The desolate space, and germs invisible.<br/>
For on whatever side thou deemest first<br/>
The primal bodies lacking, lo, that side<br/>
Will be for things the very door of death:<br/>
Wherethrough the throng of matter all will dash,<br/>
Out and abroad.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These points, if thou wilt ponder,<br/>
Then, with but paltry trouble led along...<br/>
</p>
<p>
For one thing after other will grow clear,<br/>
Nor shall the blind night rob thee of the road,<br/>
To hinder thy gaze on nature's Farthest-forth.<br/>
Thus things for things shall kindle torches new.<br/>

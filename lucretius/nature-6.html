<h1>The Nature of Things</h1>
<h2>by Lucretius</h2>
<h3>Book VI</h3>
'Twas Athens first, the glorious in name,<br/>
That whilom gave to hapless sons of men<br/>
The sheaves of harvest, and re-ordered life,<br/>
And decreed laws; and she the first that gave<br/>
Life its sweet solaces, when she begat<br/>
A man of heart so wise, who whilom poured<br/>
All wisdom forth from his truth-speaking mouth;<br/>
The glory of whom, though dead, is yet to-day,<br/>
Because of those discoveries divine<br/>
Renowned of old, exalted to the sky.<br/>
For when saw he that well-nigh everything<br/>
Which needs of man most urgently require<br/>
Was ready to hand for mortals, and that life,<br/>
As far as might be, was established safe,<br/>
That men were lords in riches, honour, praise,<br/>
And eminent in goodly fame of sons,<br/>
And that they yet, O yet, within the home,<br/>
Still had the anxious heart which vexed life<br/>
Unpausingly with torments of the mind,<br/>
And raved perforce with angry plaints, then he,<br/>
Then he, the master, did perceive that 'twas<br/>
The vessel itself which worked the bane, and all,<br/>
However wholesome, which from here or there<br/>
Was gathered into it, was by that bane<br/>
Spoilt from within,&mdash;in part, because he saw<br/>
The vessel so cracked and leaky that nowise<br/>
'T could ever be filled to brim; in part because<br/>
He marked how it polluted with foul taste<br/>
Whate'er it got within itself. So he,<br/>
The master, then by his truth-speaking words,<br/>
Purged the breasts of men, and set the bounds<br/>
Of lust and terror, and exhibited<br/>
The supreme good whither we all endeavour,<br/>
And showed the path whereby we might arrive<br/>
Thereunto by a little cross-cut straight,<br/>
And what of ills in all affairs of mortals<br/>
Upsprang and flitted deviously about<br/>
(Whether by chance or force), since nature thus<br/>
Had destined; and from out what gates a man<br/>
Should sally to each combat. And he proved<br/>
That mostly vainly doth the human race<br/>
Roll in its bosom the grim waves of care.<br/>
For just as children tremble and fear all<br/>
In the viewless dark, so even we at times<br/>
Dread in the light so many things that be<br/>
No whit more fearsome than what children feign,<br/>
Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark.<br/>
This terror then, this darkness of the mind,<br/>
Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,<br/>
Nor glittering arrows of morning can disperse,<br/>
But only nature's aspect and her law.<br/>
Wherefore the more will I go on to weave<br/>
In verses this my undertaken task.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And since I've taught thee that the world's great vaults<br/>
Are mortal and that sky is fashioned<br/>
Of frame e'en born in time, and whatsoe'er<br/>
Therein go on and must perforce go on<br/>
</p>
<p>
The most I have unravelled; what remains<br/>
Do thou take in, besides; since once for all<br/>
To climb into that chariot renowned<br/>
Of winds arise; and they appeased are<br/>
So that all things again...<br/>
</p>
<p>
Which were, are changed now, with fury stilled;<br/>
All other movements through the earth and sky<br/>
Which mortals gaze upon (O anxious oft<br/>
In quaking thoughts!), and which abase their minds<br/>
With dread of deities and press them crushed<br/>
Down to the earth, because their ignorance<br/>
Of cosmic causes forces them to yield<br/>
All things unto the empery of gods<br/>
And to concede the kingly rule to them.<br/>
For even those men who have learned full well<br/>
That godheads lead a long life free of care,<br/>
If yet meanwhile they wonder by what plan<br/>
Things can go on (and chiefly yon high things<br/>
Observed o'erhead on the ethereal coasts),<br/>
Again are hurried back unto the fears<br/>
Of old religion and adopt again<br/>
Harsh masters, deemed almighty,&mdash;wretched men,<br/>
Unwitting what can be and what cannot,<br/>
And by what law to each its scope prescribed,<br/>
Its boundary stone that clings so deep in Time.<br/>
Wherefore the more are they borne wandering on<br/>
By blindfold reason. And, Memmius, unless<br/>
From out thy mind thou spuest all of this<br/>
And casteth far from thee all thoughts which be<br/>
Unworthy gods and alien to their peace,<br/>
Then often will the holy majesties<br/>
Of the high gods be harmful unto thee,<br/>
As by thy thought degraded,&mdash;not, indeed,<br/>
That essence supreme of gods could be by this<br/>
So outraged as in wrath to thirst to seek<br/>
Revenges keen; but even because thyself<br/>
Thou plaguest with the notion that the gods,<br/>
Even they, the Calm Ones in serene repose,<br/>
Do roll the mighty waves of wrath on wrath;<br/>
Nor wilt thou enter with a serene breast<br/>
Shrines of the gods; nor wilt thou able be<br/>
In tranquil peace of mind to take and know<br/>
Those images which from their holy bodies<br/>
Are carried into intellects of men,<br/>
As the announcers of their form divine.<br/>
What sort of life will follow after this<br/>
'Tis thine to see. But that afar from us<br/>
Veriest reason may drive such life away,<br/>
Much yet remains to be embellished yet<br/>
In polished verses, albeit hath issued forth<br/>
So much from me already; lo, there is<br/>
The law and aspect of the sky to be<br/>
By reason grasped; there are the tempest times<br/>
And the bright lightnings to be hymned now&mdash;<br/>
Even what they do and from what cause soe'er<br/>
They're borne along&mdash;that thou mayst tremble not,<br/>
Marking off regions of prophetic skies<br/>
For auguries, O foolishly distraught<br/>
Even as to whence the flying flame hath come,<br/>
Or to which half of heaven it turns, or how<br/>
Through walled places it hath wound its way,<br/>
Or, after proving its dominion there,<br/>
How it hath speeded forth from thence amain&mdash;<br/>
Whereof nowise the causes do men know,<br/>
And think divinities are working there.<br/>
Do thou, Calliope, ingenious Muse,<br/>
Solace of mortals and delight of gods,<br/>
Point out the course before me, as I race<br/>
On to the white line of the utmost goal,<br/>
That I may get with signal praise the crown,<br/>
With thee my guide!<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so in first place, then,<br/>
With thunder are shaken the blue deeps of heaven,<br/>
Because the ethereal clouds, scudding aloft,<br/>
Together clash, what time 'gainst one another<br/>
The winds are battling. For never a sound there comes<br/>
From out the serene regions of the sky;<br/>
But wheresoever in a host more dense<br/>
The clouds foregather, thence more often comes<br/>
A crash with mighty rumbling. And, again,<br/>
Clouds cannot be of so condensed a frame<br/>
As stones and timbers, nor again so fine<br/>
As mists and flying smoke; for then perforce<br/>
They'd either fall, borne down by their brute weight,<br/>
Like stones, or, like the smoke, they'd powerless be<br/>
To keep their mass, or to retain within<br/>
Frore snows and storms of hail. And they give forth<br/>
O'er skiey levels of the spreading world<br/>
A sound on high, as linen-awning, stretched<br/>
O'er mighty theatres, gives forth at times<br/>
A cracking roar, when much 'tis beaten about<br/>
Betwixt the poles and cross-beams. Sometimes, too,<br/>
Asunder rent by wanton gusts, it raves<br/>
And imitates the tearing sound of sheets<br/>
Of paper&mdash;even this kind of noise thou mayst<br/>
In thunder hear&mdash;or sound as when winds whirl<br/>
With lashings and do buffet about in air<br/>
A hanging cloth and flying paper-sheets.<br/>
For sometimes, too, it chances that the clouds<br/>
Cannot together crash head-on, but rather<br/>
Move side-wise and with motions contrary<br/>
Graze each the other's body without speed,<br/>
From whence that dry sound grateth on our ears,<br/>
So long drawn-out, until the clouds have passed<br/>
From out their close positions.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, again,<br/>
In following wise all things seem oft to quake<br/>
At shock of heavy thunder, and mightiest walls<br/>
Of the wide reaches of the upper world<br/>
There on the instant to have sprung apart,<br/>
Riven asunder, what time a gathered blast<br/>
Of the fierce hurricane hath all at once<br/>
Twisted its way into a mass of clouds,<br/>
And, there enclosed, ever more and more<br/>
Compelleth by its spinning whirl the cloud<br/>
To grow all hollow with a thickened crust<br/>
Surrounding; for thereafter, when the force<br/>
And the keen onset of the wind have weakened<br/>
That crust, lo, then the cloud, to-split in twain,<br/>
Gives forth a hideous crash with bang and boom.<br/>
No marvel this; since oft a bladder small,<br/>
Filled up with air, will, when of sudden burst,<br/>
Give forth a like large sound.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's reason, too,<br/>
Why clouds make sounds, as through them blow the winds:<br/>
We see, borne down the sky, oft shapes of clouds<br/>
Rough-edged or branched many forky ways;<br/>
And 'tis the same, as when the sudden flaws<br/>
Of north-west wind through the dense forest blow,<br/>
Making the leaves to sough and limbs to crash.<br/>
It happens too at times that roused force<br/>
Of the fierce hurricane to-rends the cloud,<br/>
Breaking right through it by a front assault;<br/>
For what a blast of wind may do up there<br/>
Is manifest from facts when here on earth<br/>
A blast more gentle yet uptwists tall trees<br/>
And sucks them madly from their deepest roots.<br/>
Besides, among the clouds are waves, and these<br/>
Give, as they roughly break, a rumbling roar;<br/>
As when along deep streams or the great sea<br/>
Breaks the loud surf. It happens, too, whenever<br/>
Out from one cloud into another falls<br/>
The fiery energy of thunderbolt,<br/>
That straightaway the cloud, if full of wet,<br/>
Extinguishes the fire with mighty noise;<br/>
As iron, white from the hot furnaces,<br/>
Sizzles, when speedily we've plunged its glow<br/>
Down the cold water. Further, if a cloud<br/>
More dry receive the fire, 'twill suddenly<br/>
Kindle to flame and burn with monstrous sound,<br/>
As if a flame with whirl of winds should range<br/>
Along the laurel-tressed mountains far,<br/>
Upburning with its vast assault those trees;<br/>
Nor is there aught that in the crackling flame<br/>
Consumes with sound more terrible to man<br/>
Than Delphic laurel of Apollo lord.<br/>
Oft, too, the multitudinous crash of ice<br/>
And down-pour of swift hail gives forth a sound<br/>
Among the mighty clouds on high; for when<br/>
The wind hath packed them close, each mountain mass<br/>
Of rain-cloud, there congealed utterly<br/>
And mixed with hail-stones, breaks and booms...<br/>
</p>
<p>
Likewise, it lightens, when the clouds have struck,<br/>
By their collision, forth the seeds of fire:<br/>
As if a stone should smite a stone or steel,<br/>
For light then too leaps forth and fire then scatters<br/>
The shining sparks. But with our ears we get<br/>
The thunder after eyes behold the flash,<br/>
Because forever things arrive the ears<br/>
More tardily than the eyes&mdash;as thou mayst see<br/>
From this example too: when markest thou<br/>
Some man far yonder felling a great tree<br/>
With double-edged ax, it comes to pass<br/>
Thine eye beholds the swinging stroke before<br/>
The blow gives forth a sound athrough thine ears:<br/>
Thus also we behold the flashing ere<br/>
We hear the thunder, which discharged is<br/>
At same time with the fire and by same cause,<br/>
Born of the same collision.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In following wise<br/>
The clouds suffuse with leaping light the lands,<br/>
And the storm flashes with tremulous elan:<br/>
When the wind hath invaded a cloud, and, whirling there,<br/>
Hath wrought (as I have shown above) the cloud<br/>
Into a hollow with a thickened crust,<br/>
It becomes hot of own velocity:<br/>
Just as thou seest how motion will o'erheat<br/>
And set ablaze all objects,&mdash;verily<br/>
A leaden ball, hurtling through length of space,<br/>
Even melts. Therefore, when this same wind a-fire<br/>
Hath split black cloud, it scatters the fire-seeds,<br/>
Which, so to say, have been pressed out by force<br/>
Of sudden from the cloud;&mdash;and these do make<br/>
The pulsing flashes of flame; thence followeth<br/>
The detonation which attacks our ears<br/>
More tardily than aught which comes along<br/>
Unto the sight of eyeballs. This takes place&mdash;<br/>
As know thou mayst&mdash;at times when clouds are dense<br/>
And one upon the other piled aloft<br/>
With wonderful upheavings&mdash;nor be thou<br/>
Deceived because we see how broad their base<br/>
From underneath, and not how high they tower.<br/>
For make thine observations at a time<br/>
When winds shall bear athwart the horizon's blue<br/>
Clouds like to mountain-ranges moving on,<br/>
Or when about the sides of mighty peaks<br/>
Thou seest them one upon the other massed<br/>
And burdening downward, anchored in high repose,<br/>
With the winds sepulchred on all sides round:<br/>
Then canst thou know their mighty masses, then<br/>
Canst view their caverns, as if builded there<br/>
Of beetling crags; which, when the hurricanes<br/>
In gathered storm have filled utterly,<br/>
Then, prisoned in clouds, they rave around<br/>
With mighty roarings, and within those dens<br/>
Bluster like savage beasts, and now from here,<br/>
And now from there, send growlings through the clouds,<br/>
And seeking an outlet, whirl themselves about,<br/>
And roll from 'mid the clouds the seeds of fire,<br/>
And heap them multitudinously there,<br/>
And in the hollow furnaces within<br/>
Wheel flame around, until from bursted cloud<br/>
In forky flashes they have gleamed forth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Again, from following cause it comes to pass<br/>
That yon swift golden hue of liquid fire<br/>
Darts downward to the earth: because the clouds<br/>
Themselves must hold abundant seeds of fire;<br/>
For, when they be without all moisture, then<br/>
They be for most part of a flamy hue<br/>
And a resplendent. And, indeed, they must<br/>
Even from the light of sun unto themselves<br/>
Take multitudinous seeds, and so perforce<br/>
Redden and pour their bright fires all abroad.<br/>
And therefore, when the wind hath driven and thrust,<br/>
Hath forced and squeezed into one spot these clouds,<br/>
They pour abroad the seeds of fire pressed out,<br/>
Which make to flash these colours of the flame.<br/>
Likewise, it lightens also when the clouds<br/>
Grow rare and thin along the sky; for, when<br/>
The wind with gentle touch unravels them<br/>
And breaketh asunder as they move, those seeds<br/>
Which make the lightnings must by nature fall;<br/>
At such an hour the horizon lightens round<br/>
Without the hideous terror of dread noise<br/>
And skiey uproar.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To proceed apace,<br/>
What sort of nature thunderbolts possess<br/>
Is by their strokes made manifest and by<br/>
The brand-marks of their searing heat on things,<br/>
And by the scorched scars exhaling round<br/>
The heavy fumes of sulphur. For all these<br/>
Are marks, O not of wind or rain, but fire.<br/>
Again, they often enkindle even the roofs<br/>
Of houses and inside the very rooms<br/>
With swift flame hold a fierce dominion.<br/>
Know thou that nature fashioned this fire<br/>
Subtler than fires all other, with minute<br/>
And dartling bodies,&mdash;a fire 'gainst which there's naught<br/>
Can in the least hold out: the thunderbolt,<br/>
The mighty, passes through the hedging walls<br/>
Of houses, like to voices or a shout,&mdash;<br/>
Through stones, through bronze it passes, and it melts<br/>
Upon the instant bronze and gold; and makes,<br/>
Likewise, the wines sudden to vanish forth,<br/>
The wine-jars intact,&mdash;because, ye see,<br/>
Its heat arriving renders loose and porous<br/>
Readily all the wine&mdash;jar's earthen sides,<br/>
And winding its way within, it scattereth<br/>
The elements primordial of the wine<br/>
With speedy dissolution&mdash;process which<br/>
Even in an age the fiery steam of sun<br/>
Could not accomplish, however puissant he<br/>
With his hot coruscations: so much more<br/>
Agile and overpowering is this force.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now in what manner engendered are these things,<br/>
How fashioned of such impetuous strength<br/>
As to cleave towers asunder, and houses all<br/>
To overtopple, and to wrench apart<br/>
Timbers and beams, and heroes' monuments<br/>
To pile in ruins and upheave amain,<br/>
And to take breath forever out of men,<br/>
And to o'erthrow the cattle everywhere,&mdash;<br/>
Yes, by what force the lightnings do all this,<br/>
All this and more, I will unfold to thee,<br/>
Nor longer keep thee in mere promises.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The bolts of thunder, then, must be conceived<br/>
As all begotten in those crasser clouds<br/>
Up-piled aloft; for, from the sky serene<br/>
And from the clouds of lighter density,<br/>
None are sent forth forever. That 'tis so<br/>
Beyond a doubt, fact plain to sense declares:<br/>
To wit, at such a time the densed clouds<br/>
So mass themselves through all the upper air<br/>
That we might think that round about all murk<br/>
Had parted forth from Acheron and filled<br/>
The mighty vaults of sky&mdash;so grievously,<br/>
As gathers thus the storm-clouds' gruesome might,<br/>
Do faces of black horror hang on high&mdash;<br/>
When tempest begins its thunderbolts to forge.<br/>
Besides, full often also out at sea<br/>
A blackest thunderhead, like cataract<br/>
Of pitch hurled down from heaven, and far away<br/>
Bulging with murkiness, down on the waves<br/>
Falls with vast uproar, and draws on amain<br/>
The darkling tempests big with thunderbolts<br/>
And hurricanes, itself the while so crammed<br/>
Tremendously with fires and winds, that even<br/>
Back on the lands the people shudder round<br/>
And seek for cover. Therefore, as I said,<br/>
The storm must be conceived as o'er our head<br/>
Towering most high; for never would the clouds<br/>
O'erwhelm the lands with such a massy dark,<br/>
Unless up-builded heap on lofty heap,<br/>
To shut the round sun off. Nor could the clouds,<br/>
As on they come, engulf with rain so vast<br/>
As thus to make the rivers overflow<br/>
And fields to float, if ether were not thus<br/>
Furnished with lofty-piled clouds. Lo, then,<br/>
Here be all things fulfilled with winds and fires&mdash;<br/>
Hence the long lightnings and the thunders loud.<br/>
For, verily, I've taught thee even now<br/>
How cavernous clouds hold seeds innumerable<br/>
Of fiery exhalations, and they must<br/>
From off the sunbeams and the heat of these<br/>
Take many still. And so, when that same wind<br/>
(Which, haply, into one region of the sky<br/>
Collects those clouds) hath pressed from out the same<br/>
The many fiery seeds, and with that fire<br/>
Hath at the same time inter-mixed itself,<br/>
O then and there that wind, a whirlwind now,<br/>
Deep in the belly of the cloud spins round<br/>
In narrow confines, and sharpens there inside<br/>
In glowing furnaces the thunderbolt.<br/>
For in a two-fold manner is that wind<br/>
Enkindled all: it trembles into heat<br/>
Both by its own velocity and by<br/>
Repeated touch of fire. Thereafter, when<br/>
The energy of wind is heated through<br/>
And the fierce impulse of the fire hath sped<br/>
Deeply within, O then the thunderbolt,<br/>
Now ripened, so to say, doth suddenly<br/>
Splinter the cloud, and the aroused flash<br/>
Leaps onward, lumining with forky light<br/>
All places round. And followeth anon<br/>
A clap so heavy that the skiey vaults,<br/>
As if asunder burst, seem from on high<br/>
To engulf the earth. Then fearfully a quake<br/>
Pervades the lands, and 'long the lofty skies<br/>
Run the far rumblings. For at such a time<br/>
Nigh the whole tempest quakes, shook through and through,<br/>
And roused are the roarings,&mdash;from which shock<br/>
Comes such resounding and abounding rain,<br/>
That all the murky ether seems to turn<br/>
Now into rain, and, as it tumbles down,<br/>
To summon the fields back to primeval floods:<br/>
So big the rains that be sent down on men<br/>
By burst of cloud and by the hurricane,<br/>
What time the thunder-clap, from burning bolt<br/>
That cracks the cloud, flies forth along. At times<br/>
The force of wind, excited from without,<br/>
Smiteth into a cloud already hot<br/>
With a ripe thunderbolt. And when that wind<br/>
Hath splintered that cloud, then down there cleaves forthwith<br/>
Yon fiery coil of flame which still we call,<br/>
Even with our fathers' word, a thunderbolt.<br/>
The same thing haps toward every other side<br/>
Whither that force hath swept. It happens, too,<br/>
That sometimes force of wind, though hurtled forth<br/>
Without all fire, yet in its voyage through space<br/>
Igniteth, whilst it comes along, along,&mdash;<br/>
Losing some larger bodies which cannot<br/>
Pass, like the others, through the bulks of air,&mdash;<br/>
And, scraping together out of air itself<br/>
Some smaller bodies, carries them along,<br/>
And these, commingling, by their flight make fire:<br/>
Much in the manner as oft a leaden ball<br/>
Grows hot upon its aery course, the while<br/>
It loseth many bodies of stark cold<br/>
And taketh into itself along the air<br/>
New particles of fire. It happens, too,<br/>
That force of blow itself arouses fire,<br/>
When force of wind, a-cold and hurtled forth<br/>
Without all fire, hath strook somewhere amain&mdash;<br/>
No marvel, because, when with terrific stroke<br/>
'Thas smitten, the elements of fiery-stuff<br/>
Can stream together from out the very wind<br/>
And, simultaneously, from out that thing<br/>
Which then and there receives the stroke: as flies<br/>
The fire when with the steel we hack the stone;<br/>
Nor yet, because the force of steel's a-cold,<br/>
Rush the less speedily together there<br/>
Under the stroke its seeds of radiance hot.<br/>
And therefore, thuswise must an object too<br/>
Be kindled by a thunderbolt, if haply<br/>
'Thas been adapt and suited to the flames.<br/>
Yet force of wind must not be rashly deemed<br/>
As altogether and entirely cold&mdash;<br/>
That force which is discharged from on high<br/>
With such stupendous power; but if 'tis not<br/>
Upon its course already kindled with fire,<br/>
It yet arriveth warmed and mixed with heat.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And, now, the speed and stroke of thunderbolt<br/>
Is so tremendous, and with glide so swift<br/>
Those thunderbolts rush on and down, because<br/>
Their roused force itself collects itself<br/>
First always in the clouds, and then prepares<br/>
For the huge effort of their going-forth;<br/>
Next, when the cloud no longer can retain<br/>
The increment of their fierce impetus,<br/>
Their force is pressed out, and therefore flies<br/>
With impetus so wondrous, like to shots<br/>
Hurled from the powerful Roman catapults.<br/>
Note, too, this force consists of elements<br/>
Both small and smooth, nor is there aught that can<br/>
With ease resist such nature. For it darts<br/>
Between and enters through the pores of things;<br/>
And so it never falters in delay<br/>
Despite innumerable collisions, but<br/>
Flies shooting onward with a swift elan.<br/>
Next, since by nature always every weight<br/>
Bears downward, doubled is the swiftness then<br/>
And that elan is still more wild and dread,<br/>
When, verily, to weight are added blows,<br/>
So that more madly and more fiercely then<br/>
The thunderbolt shakes into shivers all<br/>
That blocks its path, following on its way.<br/>
Then, too, because it comes along, along<br/>
With one continuing elan, it must<br/>
Take on velocity anew, anew,<br/>
Which still increases as it goes, and ever<br/>
Augments the bolt's vast powers and to the blow<br/>
Gives larger vigour; for it forces all,<br/>
All of the thunder's seeds of fire, to sweep<br/>
In a straight line unto one place, as 'twere,&mdash;<br/>
Casting them one by other, as they roll,<br/>
Into that onward course. Again, perchance,<br/>
In coming along, it pulls from out the air<br/>
Some certain bodies, which by their own blows<br/>
Enkindle its velocity. And, lo,<br/>
It comes through objects leaving them unharmed,<br/>
It goes through many things and leaves them whole,<br/>
Because the liquid fire flieth along<br/>
Athrough their pores. And much it does transfix,<br/>
When these primordial atoms of the bolt<br/>
Have fallen upon the atoms of these things<br/>
Precisely where the intertwined atoms<br/>
Are held together. And, further, easily<br/>
Brass it unbinds and quickly fuseth gold,<br/>
Because its force is so minutely made<br/>
Of tiny parts and elements so smooth<br/>
That easily they wind their way within,<br/>
And, when once in, quickly unbind all knots<br/>
And loosen all the bonds of union there.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And most in autumn is shaken the house of heaven,<br/>
The house so studded with the glittering stars,<br/>
And the whole earth around&mdash;most too in spring<br/>
When flowery times unfold themselves: for, lo,<br/>
In the cold season is there lack of fire,<br/>
And winds are scanty in the hot, and clouds<br/>
Have not so dense a bulk. But when, indeed,<br/>
The seasons of heaven are betwixt these twain,<br/>
The divers causes of the thunderbolt<br/>
Then all concur; for then both cold and heat<br/>
Are mixed in the cross-seas of the year,<br/>
So that a discord rises among things<br/>
And air in vast tumultuosity<br/>
Billows, infuriate with the fires and winds&mdash;<br/>
Of which the both are needed by the cloud<br/>
For fabrication of the thunderbolt.<br/>
For the first part of heat and last of cold<br/>
Is the time of spring; wherefore must things unlike<br/>
Do battle one with other, and, when mixed,<br/>
Tumultuously rage. And when rolls round<br/>
The latest heat mixed with the earliest chill&mdash;<br/>
The time which bears the name of autumn&mdash;then<br/>
Likewise fierce cold-spells wrestle with fierce heats.<br/>
On this account these seasons of the year<br/>
Are nominated "cross-seas."&mdash;And no marvel<br/>
If in those times the thunderbolts prevail<br/>
And storms are roused turbulent in heaven,<br/>
Since then both sides in dubious warfare rage<br/>
Tumultuously, the one with flames, the other<br/>
With winds and with waters mixed with winds.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This, this it is, O Memmius, to see through<br/>
The very nature of fire-fraught thunderbolt;<br/>
O this it is to mark by what blind force<br/>
It maketh each effect, and not, O not<br/>
To unwind Etrurian scrolls oracular,<br/>
Inquiring tokens of occult will of gods,<br/>
Even as to whence the flying flame hath come,<br/>
Or to which half of heaven it turns, or how<br/>
Through walled places it hath wound its way,<br/>
Or, after proving its dominion there,<br/>
How it hath speeded forth from thence amain,<br/>
Or what the thunderstroke portends of ill<br/>
From out high heaven. But if Jupiter<br/>
And other gods shake those refulgent vaults<br/>
With dread reverberations and hurl fire<br/>
Whither it pleases each, why smite they not<br/>
Mortals of reckless and revolting crimes,<br/>
That such may pant from a transpierced breast<br/>
Forth flames of the red levin&mdash;unto men<br/>
A drastic lesson?&mdash;why is rather he&mdash;<br/>
O he self-conscious of no foul offence&mdash;<br/>
Involved in flames, though innocent, and clasped<br/>
Up-caught in skiey whirlwind and in fire?<br/>
Nay, why, then, aim they at eternal wastes,<br/>
And spend themselves in vain?&mdash;perchance, even so<br/>
To exercise their arms and strengthen shoulders?<br/>
Why suffer they the Father's javelin<br/>
To be so blunted on the earth? And why<br/>
Doth he himself allow it, nor spare the same<br/>
Even for his enemies? O why most oft<br/>
Aims he at lofty places? Why behold we<br/>
Marks of his lightnings most on mountain tops?<br/>
Then for what reason shoots he at the sea?&mdash;<br/>
What sacrilege have waves and bulk of brine<br/>
And floating fields of foam been guilty of?<br/>
Besides, if 'tis his will that we beware<br/>
Against the lightning-stroke, why feareth he<br/>
To grant us power for to behold the shot?<br/>
And, contrariwise, if wills he to o'erwhelm us,<br/>
Quite off our guard, with fire, why thunders he<br/>
Off in yon quarter, so that we may shun?<br/>
Why rouseth he beforehand darkling air<br/>
And the far din and rumblings? And O how<br/>
Canst thou believe he shoots at one same time<br/>
Into diverse directions? Or darest thou<br/>
Contend that never hath it come to pass<br/>
That divers strokes have happened at one time?<br/>
But oft and often hath it come to pass,<br/>
And often still it must, that, even as showers<br/>
And rains o'er many regions fall, so too<br/>
Dart many thunderbolts at one same time.<br/>
Again, why never hurtles Jupiter<br/>
A bolt upon the lands nor pours abroad<br/>
Clap upon clap, when skies are cloudless all?<br/>
Or, say, doth he, so soon as ever the clouds<br/>
Have come thereunder, then into the same<br/>
Descend in person, that from thence he may<br/>
Near-by decide upon the stroke of shaft?<br/>
And, lastly, why, with devastating bolt<br/>
Shakes he asunder holy shrines of gods<br/>
And his own thrones of splendour, and to-breaks<br/>
The well-wrought idols of divinities,<br/>
And robs of glory his own images<br/>
By wound of violence?<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to return apace,<br/>
Easy it is from these same facts to know<br/>
In just what wise those things (which from their sort<br/>
The Greeks have named "bellows") do come down,<br/>
Discharged from on high, upon the seas.<br/>
For it haps that sometimes from the sky descends<br/>
Upon the seas a column, as if pushed,<br/>
Round which the surges seethe, tremendously<br/>
Aroused by puffing gusts; and whatso'er<br/>
Of ships are caught within that tumult then<br/>
Come into extreme peril, dashed along.<br/>
This haps when sometimes wind's aroused force<br/>
Can't burst the cloud it tries to, but down-weighs<br/>
That cloud, until 'tis like a column from sky<br/>
Upon the seas pushed downward&mdash;gradually,<br/>
As if a Somewhat from on high were shoved<br/>
By fist and nether thrust of arm, and lengthened<br/>
Far to the waves. And when the force of wind<br/>
Hath rived this cloud, from out the cloud it rushes<br/>
Down on the seas, and starts among the waves<br/>
A wondrous seething, for the eddying whirl<br/>
Descends and downward draws along with it<br/>
That cloud of ductile body. And soon as ever<br/>
'Thas shoved unto the levels of the main<br/>
That laden cloud, the whirl suddenly then<br/>
Plunges its whole self into the waters there<br/>
And rouses all the sea with monstrous roar,<br/>
Constraining it to seethe. It happens too<br/>
That very vortex of the wind involves<br/>
Itself in clouds, scraping from out the air<br/>
The seeds of cloud, and counterfeits, as 'twere,<br/>
The "bellows" pushed from heaven. And when this shape<br/>
Hath dropped upon the lands and burst apart,<br/>
It belches forth immeasurable might<br/>
Of whirlwind and of blast. Yet since 'tis formed<br/>
At most but rarely, and on land the hills<br/>
Must block its way, 'tis seen more oft out there<br/>
On the broad prospect of the level main<br/>
Along the free horizons.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into being<br/>
The clouds condense, when in this upper space<br/>
Of the high heaven have gathered suddenly,<br/>
As round they flew, unnumbered particles&mdash;<br/>
World's rougher ones, which can, though interlinked<br/>
With scanty couplings, yet be fastened firm,<br/>
The one on other caught. These particles<br/>
First cause small clouds to form; and, thereupon,<br/>
These catch the one on other and swarm in a flock<br/>
And grow by their conjoining, and by winds<br/>
Are borne along, along, until collects<br/>
The tempest fury. Happens, too, the nearer<br/>
The mountain summits neighbour to the sky,<br/>
The more unceasingly their far crags smoke<br/>
With the thick darkness of swart cloud, because<br/>
When first the mists do form, ere ever the eyes<br/>
Can there behold them (tenuous as they be),<br/>
The carrier-winds will drive them up and on<br/>
Unto the topmost summits of the mountain;<br/>
And then at last it happens, when they be<br/>
In vaster throng upgathered, that they can<br/>
By this very condensation lie revealed,<br/>
And that at same time they are seen to surge<br/>
From very vertex of the mountain up<br/>
Into far ether. For very fact and feeling,<br/>
As we up-climb high mountains, proveth clear<br/>
That windy are those upward regions free.<br/>
Besides, the clothes hung-out along the shore,<br/>
When in they take the clinging moisture, prove<br/>
That nature lifts from over all the sea<br/>
Unnumbered particles. Whereby the more<br/>
'Tis manifest that many particles<br/>
Even from the salt upheavings of the main<br/>
Can rise together to augment the bulk<br/>
Of massed clouds. For moistures in these twain<br/>
Are near akin. Besides, from out all rivers,<br/>
As well as from the land itself, we see<br/>
Up-rising mists and steam, which like a breath<br/>
Are forced out from them and borne aloft,<br/>
To curtain heaven with their murk, and make,<br/>
By slow foregathering, the skiey clouds.<br/>
For, in addition, lo, the heat on high<br/>
Of constellated ether burdens down<br/>
Upon them, and by sort of condensation<br/>
Weaveth beneath the azure firmament<br/>
The reek of darkling cloud. It happens, too,<br/>
That hither to the skies from the Beyond<br/>
Do come those particles which make the clouds<br/>
And flying thunderheads. For I have taught<br/>
That this their number is innumerable<br/>
And infinite the sum of the Abyss,<br/>
And I have shown with what stupendous speed<br/>
Those bodies fly and how they're wont to pass<br/>
Amain through incommunicable space.<br/>
Therefore, 'tis not exceeding strange, if oft<br/>
In little time tempest and darkness cover<br/>
With bulking thunderheads hanging on high<br/>
The oceans and the lands, since everywhere<br/>
Through all the narrow tubes of yonder ether,<br/>
Yea, so to speak, through all the breathing-holes<br/>
Of the great upper-world encompassing,<br/>
There be for the primordial elements<br/>
Exits and entrances.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now come, and how<br/>
The rainy moisture thickens into being<br/>
In the lofty clouds, and how upon the lands<br/>
'Tis then discharged in down-pour of large showers,<br/>
I will unfold. And first triumphantly<br/>
Will I persuade thee that up-rise together,<br/>
With clouds themselves, full many seeds of water<br/>
From out all things, and that they both increase&mdash;<br/>
Both clouds and water which is in the clouds&mdash;<br/>
In like proportion, as our frames increase<br/>
In like proportion with our blood, as well<br/>
As sweat or any moisture in our members.<br/>
Besides, the clouds take in from time to time<br/>
Much moisture risen from the broad marine,&mdash;<br/>
Whilst the winds bear them o'er the mighty sea,<br/>
Like hanging fleeces of white wool. Thuswise,<br/>
Even from all rivers is there lifted up<br/>
Moisture into the clouds. And when therein<br/>
The seeds of water so many in many ways<br/>
Have come together, augmented from all sides,<br/>
The close-jammed clouds then struggle to discharge<br/>
Their rain-storms for a two-fold reason: lo,<br/>
The wind's force crowds them, and the very excess<br/>
Of storm-clouds (massed in a vaster throng)<br/>
Giveth an urge and pressure from above<br/>
And makes the rains out-pour. Besides when, too,<br/>
The clouds are winnowed by the winds, or scattered<br/>
Smitten on top by heat of sun, they send<br/>
Their rainy moisture, and distil their drops,<br/>
Even as the wax, by fiery warmth on top,<br/>
Wasteth and liquefies abundantly.<br/>
But comes the violence of the bigger rains<br/>
When violently the clouds are weighted down<br/>
Both by their cumulated mass and by<br/>
The onset of the wind. And rains are wont<br/>
To endure awhile and to abide for long,<br/>
When many seeds of waters are aroused,<br/>
And clouds on clouds and racks on racks outstream<br/>
In piled layers and are borne along<br/>
From every quarter, and when all the earth<br/>
Smoking exhales her moisture. At such a time<br/>
When sun with beams amid the tempest-murk<br/>
Hath shone against the showers of black rains,<br/>
Then in the swart clouds there emerges bright<br/>
The radiance of the bow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as to things<br/>
Not mentioned here which of themselves do grow<br/>
Or of themselves are gendered, and all things<br/>
Which in the clouds condense to being&mdash;all,<br/>
Snow and the winds, hail and the hoar-frosts chill,<br/>
And freezing, mighty force&mdash;of lakes and pools<br/>
The mighty hardener, and mighty check<br/>
Which in the winter curbeth everywhere<br/>
The rivers as they go&mdash;'tis easy still,<br/>
Soon to discover and with mind to see<br/>
How they all happen, whereby gendered,<br/>
When once thou well hast understood just what<br/>
Functions have been vouchsafed from of old<br/>
Unto the procreant atoms of the world.<br/>
Now come, and what the law of earthquakes is<br/>
Hearken, and first of all take care to know<br/>
That the under-earth, like to the earth around us,<br/>
Is full of windy caverns all about;<br/>
And many a pool and many a grim abyss<br/>
She bears within her bosom, ay, and cliffs<br/>
And jagged scarps; and many a river, hid<br/>
Beneath her chine, rolls rapidly along<br/>
Its billows and plunging boulders. For clear fact<br/>
Requires that earth must be in every part<br/>
Alike in constitution. Therefore, earth,<br/>
With these things underneath affixed and set,<br/>
Trembleth above, jarred by big down-tumblings,<br/>
When time hath undermined the huge caves,<br/>
The subterranean. Yea, whole mountains fall,<br/>
And instantly from spot of that big jar<br/>
There quiver the tremors far and wide abroad.<br/>
And with good reason: since houses on the street<br/>
Begin to quake throughout, when jarred by a cart<br/>
Of no large weight; and, too, the furniture<br/>
Within the house up-bounds, when a paving-block<br/>
Gives either iron rim of the wheels a jolt.<br/>
It happens, too, when some prodigious bulk<br/>
Of age-worn soil is rolled from mountain slopes<br/>
Into tremendous pools of water dark,<br/>
That the reeling land itself is rocked about<br/>
By the water's undulations; as a basin<br/>
Sometimes won't come to rest until the fluid<br/>
Within it ceases to be rocked about<br/>
In random undulations.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And besides,<br/>
When subterranean winds, up-gathered there<br/>
In the hollow deeps, bulk forward from one spot,<br/>
And press with the big urge of mighty powers<br/>
Against the lofty grottos, then the earth<br/>
Bulks to that quarter whither push amain<br/>
The headlong winds. Then all the builded houses<br/>
Above ground&mdash;and the more, the higher up-reared<br/>
Unto the sky&mdash;lean ominously, careening<br/>
Into the same direction; and the beams,<br/>
Wrenched forward, over-hang, ready to go.<br/>
Yet dread men to believe that there awaits<br/>
The nature of the mighty world a time<br/>
Of doom and cataclysm, albeit they see<br/>
So great a bulk of lands to bulge and break!<br/>
And lest the winds blew back again, no force<br/>
Could rein things in nor hold from sure career<br/>
On to disaster. But now because those winds<br/>
Blow back and forth in alternation strong,<br/>
And, so to say, rallying charge again,<br/>
And then repulsed retreat, on this account<br/>
Earth oftener threatens than she brings to pass<br/>
Collapses dire. For to one side she leans,<br/>
Then back she sways; and after tottering<br/>
Forward, recovers then her seats of poise.<br/>
Thus, this is why whole houses rock, the roofs<br/>
More than the middle stories, middle more<br/>
Than lowest, and the lowest least of all.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Arises, too, this same great earth-quaking,<br/>
When wind and some prodigious force of air,<br/>
Collected from without or down within<br/>
The old telluric deeps, have hurled themselves<br/>
Amain into those caverns sub-terrene,<br/>
And there at first tumultuously chafe<br/>
Among the vasty grottos, borne about<br/>
In mad rotations, till their lashed force<br/>
Aroused out-bursts abroad, and then and there,<br/>
Riving the deep earth, makes a mighty chasm&mdash;<br/>
What once in Syrian Sidon did befall,<br/>
And once in Peloponnesian Aegium,<br/>
Twain cities which such out-break of wild air<br/>
And earth's convulsion, following hard upon,<br/>
O'erthrew of old. And many a walled town,<br/>
Besides, hath fall'n by such omnipotent<br/>
Convulsions on the land, and in the sea<br/>
Engulfed hath sunken many a city down<br/>
With all its populace. But if, indeed,<br/>
They burst not forth, yet is the very rush<br/>
Of the wild air and fury-force of wind<br/>
Then dissipated, like an ague-fit,<br/>
Through the innumerable pores of earth,<br/>
To set her all a-shake&mdash;even as a chill,<br/>
When it hath gone into our marrow-bones,<br/>
Sets us convulsively, despite ourselves,<br/>
A-shivering and a-shaking. Therefore, men<br/>
With two-fold terror bustle in alarm<br/>
Through cities to and fro: they fear the roofs<br/>
Above the head; and underfoot they dread<br/>
The caverns, lest the nature of the earth<br/>
Suddenly rend them open, and she gape,<br/>
Herself asunder, with tremendous maw,<br/>
And, all confounded, seek to chock it full<br/>
With her own ruins. Let men, then, go on<br/>
Feigning at will that heaven and earth shall be<br/>
Inviolable, entrusted evermore<br/>
To an eternal weal: and yet at times<br/>
The very force of danger here at hand<br/>
Prods them on some side with this goad of fear&mdash;<br/>
This among others&mdash;that the earth, withdrawn<br/>
Abruptly from under their feet, be hurried down,<br/>
Down into the abyss, and the Sum-of-Things<br/>
Be following after, utterly fordone,<br/>
Till be but wrack and wreckage of a world.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In chief, men marvel nature renders not<br/>
Bigger and bigger the bulk of ocean, since<br/>
So vast the down-rush of the waters be,<br/>
And every river out of every realm<br/>
Cometh thereto; and add the random rains<br/>
And flying tempests, which spatter every sea<br/>
And every land bedew; add their own springs:<br/>
Yet all of these unto the ocean's sum<br/>
Shall be but as the increase of a drop.<br/>
Wherefore 'tis less a marvel that the sea,<br/>
The mighty ocean, increaseth not. Besides,<br/>
Sun with his heat draws off a mighty part:<br/>
Yea, we behold that sun with burning beams<br/>
To dry our garments dripping all with wet;<br/>
And many a sea, and far out-spread beneath,<br/>
Do we behold. Therefore, however slight<br/>
The portion of wet that sun on any spot<br/>
Culls from the level main, he still will take<br/>
From off the waves in such a wide expanse<br/>
Abundantly. Then, further, also winds,<br/>
Sweeping the level waters, can bear off<br/>
A mighty part of wet, since we behold<br/>
Oft in a single night the highways dried<br/>
By winds, and soft mud crusted o'er at dawn.<br/>
Again, I've taught thee that the clouds bear off<br/>
Much moisture too, up-taken from the reaches<br/>
Of the mighty main, and sprinkle it about<br/>
O'er all the zones, when rain is on the lands<br/>
And winds convey the aery racks of vapour.<br/>
Lastly, since earth is porous through her frame,<br/>
And neighbours on the seas, girdling their shores,<br/>
The water's wet must seep into the lands<br/>
From briny ocean, as from lands it comes<br/>
Into the seas. For brine is filtered off,<br/>
And then the liquid stuff seeps back again<br/>
And all re-poureth at the river-heads,<br/>
Whence in fresh-water currents it returns<br/>
Over the lands, adown the channels which<br/>
Were cleft erstwhile and erstwhile bore along<br/>
The liquid-footed floods.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the cause<br/>
Whereby athrough the throat of Aetna's Mount<br/>
Such vast tornado-fires out-breathe at times,<br/>
I will unfold: for with no middling might<br/>
Of devastation the flamy tempest rose<br/>
And held dominion in Sicilian fields:<br/>
Drawing upon itself the upturned faces<br/>
Of neighbouring clans, what time they saw afar<br/>
The skiey vaults a-fume and sparkling all,<br/>
And filled their bosoms with dread anxiety<br/>
Of what new thing nature were travailing at.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In these affairs it much behooveth thee<br/>
To look both wide and deep, and far abroad<br/>
To peer to every quarter, that thou mayst<br/>
Remember how boundless is the Sum-of-Things,<br/>
And mark how infinitely small a part<br/>
Of the whole Sum is this one sky of ours&mdash;<br/>
O not so large a part as is one man<br/>
Of the whole earth. And plainly if thou viewest<br/>
This cosmic fact, placing it square in front,<br/>
And plainly understandest, thou wilt leave<br/>
Wondering at many things. For who of us<br/>
Wondereth if some one gets into his joints<br/>
A fever, gathering head with fiery heat,<br/>
Or any other dolorous disease<br/>
Along his members? For anon the foot<br/>
Grows blue and bulbous; often the sharp twinge<br/>
Seizes the teeth, attacks the very eyes;<br/>
Out-breaks the sacred fire, and, crawling on<br/>
Over the body, burneth every part<br/>
It seizeth on, and works its hideous way<br/>
Along the frame. No marvel this, since, lo,<br/>
Of things innumerable be seeds enough,<br/>
And this our earth and sky do bring to us<br/>
Enough of bane from whence can grow the strength<br/>
Of maladies uncounted. Thuswise, then,<br/>
We must suppose to all the sky and earth<br/>
Are ever supplied from out the infinite<br/>
All things, O all in stores enough whereby<br/>
The shaken earth can of a sudden move,<br/>
And fierce typhoons can over sea and lands<br/>
Go tearing on, and Aetna's fires o'erflow,<br/>
And heaven become a flame-burst. For that, too,<br/>
Happens at times, and the celestial vaults<br/>
Glow into fire, and rainy tempests rise<br/>
In heavier congregation, when, percase,<br/>
The seeds of water have foregathered thus<br/>
From out the infinite. "Aye, but passing huge<br/>
The fiery turmoil of that conflagration!"<br/>
So sayst thou; well, huge many a river seems<br/>
To him that erstwhile ne'er a larger saw;<br/>
Thus, huge seems tree or man; and everything<br/>
Which mortal sees the biggest of each class,<br/>
That he imagines to be "huge"; though yet<br/>
All these, with sky and land and sea to boot,<br/>
Are all as nothing to the sum entire<br/>
Of the all-Sum.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now I will unfold<br/>
At last how yonder suddenly angered flame<br/>
Out-blows abroad from vasty furnaces<br/>
Aetnaean. First, the mountain's nature is<br/>
All under-hollow, propped about, about<br/>
With caverns of basaltic piers. And, lo,<br/>
In all its grottos be there wind and air&mdash;<br/>
For wind is made when air hath been uproused<br/>
By violent agitation. When this air<br/>
Is heated through and through, and, raging round,<br/>
Hath made the earth and all the rocks it touches<br/>
Horribly hot, and hath struck off from them<br/>
Fierce fire of swiftest flame, it lifts itself<br/>
And hurtles thus straight upwards through its throat<br/>
Into high heav'n, and thus bears on afar<br/>
Its burning blasts and scattereth afar<br/>
Its ashes, and rolls a smoke of pitchy murk<br/>
And heaveth the while boulders of wondrous weight&mdash;<br/>
Leaving no doubt in thee that 'tis the air's<br/>
Tumultuous power. Besides, in mighty part,<br/>
The sea there at the roots of that same mount<br/>
Breaks its old billows and sucks back its surf.<br/>
And grottos from the sea pass in below<br/>
Even to the bottom of the mountain's throat.<br/>
Herethrough thou must admit there go...<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the conditions force [the water and air]<br/>
Deeply to penetrate from the open sea,<br/>
And to out-blow abroad, and to up-bear<br/>
Thereby the flame, and to up-cast from deeps<br/>
The boulders, and to rear the clouds of sand.<br/>
For at the top be "bowls," as people there<br/>
Are wont to name what we at Rome do call<br/>
The throats and mouths.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There be, besides, some thing<br/>
Of which 'tis not enough one only cause<br/>
To state&mdash;but rather several, whereof one<br/>
Will be the true: lo, if thou shouldst espy<br/>
Lying afar some fellow's lifeless corse,<br/>
'Twere meet to name all causes of a death,<br/>
That cause of his death might thereby be named:<br/>
For prove thou mayst he perished not by steel,<br/>
By cold, nor even by poison nor disease,<br/>
Yet somewhat of this sort hath come to him<br/>
We know&mdash;And thus we have to say the same<br/>
In divers cases.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the summer, Nile<br/>
Waxeth and overfloweth the champaign,<br/>
Unique in all the landscape, river sole<br/>
Of the Aegyptians. In mid-season heats<br/>
Often and oft he waters Aegypt o'er,<br/>
Either because in summer against his mouths<br/>
Come those northwinds which at that time of year<br/>
Men name the Etesian blasts, and, blowing thus<br/>
Upstream, retard, and, forcing back his waves,<br/>
Fill him o'erfull and force his flow to stop.<br/>
For out of doubt these blasts which driven be<br/>
From icy constellations of the pole<br/>
Are borne straight up the river. Comes that river<br/>
From forth the sultry places down the south,<br/>
Rising far up in midmost realm of day,<br/>
Among black generations of strong men<br/>
With sun-baked skins. 'Tis possible, besides,<br/>
That a big bulk of piled sand may bar<br/>
His mouths against his onward waves, when sea,<br/>
Wild in the winds, tumbles the sand to inland;<br/>
Whereby the river's outlet were less free,<br/>
Likewise less headlong his descending floods.<br/>
It may be, too, that in this season rains<br/>
Are more abundant at its fountain head,<br/>
Because the Etesian blasts of those northwinds<br/>
Then urge all clouds into those inland parts.<br/>
And, soothly, when they're thus foregathered there,<br/>
Urged yonder into midmost realm of day,<br/>
Then, crowded against the lofty mountain sides,<br/>
They're massed and powerfully pressed. Again,<br/>
Perchance, his waters wax, O far away,<br/>
Among the Aethiopians' lofty mountains,<br/>
When the all-beholding sun with thawing beams<br/>
Drives the white snows to flow into the vales.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now come; and unto thee I will unfold,<br/>
As to the Birdless spots and Birdless tarns,<br/>
What sort of nature they are furnished with.<br/>
First, as to name of "birdless,"&mdash;that derives<br/>
From very fact, because they noxious be<br/>
Unto all birds. For when above those spots<br/>
In horizontal flight the birds have come,<br/>
Forgetting to oar with wings, they furl their sails,<br/>
And, with down-drooping of their delicate necks,<br/>
Fall headlong into earth, if haply such<br/>
The nature of the spots, or into water,<br/>
If haply spreads thereunder Birdless tarn.<br/>
Such spot's at Cumae, where the mountains smoke,<br/>
Charged with the pungent sulphur, and increased<br/>
With steaming springs. And such a spot there is<br/>
Within the walls of Athens, even there<br/>
On summit of Acropolis, beside<br/>
Fane of Tritonian Pallas bountiful,<br/>
Where never cawing crows can wing their course,<br/>
Not even when smoke the altars with good gifts,&mdash;<br/>
But evermore they flee&mdash;yet not from wrath<br/>
Of Pallas, grieved at that espial old,<br/>
As poets of the Greeks have sung the tale;<br/>
But very nature of the place compels.<br/>
In Syria also&mdash;as men say&mdash;a spot<br/>
Is to be seen, where also four-foot kinds,<br/>
As soon as ever they've set their steps within,<br/>
Collapse, o'ercome by its essential power,<br/>
As if there slaughtered to the under-gods.<br/>
Lo, all these wonders work by natural law,<br/>
And from what causes they are brought to pass<br/>
The origin is manifest; so, haply,<br/>
Let none believe that in these regions stands<br/>
The gate of Orcus, nor us then suppose,<br/>
Haply, that thence the under-gods draw down<br/>
Souls to dark shores of Acheron&mdash;as stags,<br/>
The wing-footed, are thought to draw to light,<br/>
By sniffing nostrils, from their dusky lairs<br/>
The wriggling generations of wild snakes.<br/>
How far removed from true reason is this,<br/>
Perceive thou straight; for now I'll try to say<br/>
Somewhat about the very fact.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, first,<br/>
This do I say, as oft I've said before:<br/>
In earth are atoms of things of every sort;<br/>
And know, these all thus rise from out the earth&mdash;<br/>
Many life-giving which be good for food,<br/>
And many which can generate disease<br/>
And hasten death, O many primal seeds<br/>
Of many things in many modes&mdash;since earth<br/>
Contains them mingled and gives forth discrete.<br/>
And we have shown before that certain things<br/>
Be unto certain creatures suited more<br/>
For ends of life, by virtue of a nature,<br/>
A texture, and primordial shapes, unlike<br/>
For kinds alike. Then too 'tis thine to see<br/>
How many things oppressive be and foul<br/>
To man, and to sensation most malign:<br/>
Many meander miserably through ears;<br/>
Many in-wind athrough the nostrils too,<br/>
Malign and harsh when mortal draws a breath;<br/>
Of not a few must one avoid the touch;<br/>
Of not a few must one escape the sight;<br/>
And some there be all loathsome to the taste;<br/>
And many, besides, relax the languid limbs<br/>
Along the frame, and undermine the soul<br/>
In its abodes within. To certain trees<br/>
There hath been given so dolorous a shade<br/>
That often they gender achings of the head,<br/>
If one but be beneath, outstretched on the sward.<br/>
There is, again, on Helicon's high hills<br/>
A tree that's wont to kill a man outright<br/>
By fetid odour of its very flower.<br/>
And when the pungent stench of the night-lamp,<br/>
Extinguished but a moment since, assails<br/>
The nostrils, then and there it puts to sleep<br/>
A man afflicted with the falling sickness<br/>
And foamings at the mouth. A woman, too,<br/>
At the heavy castor drowses back in chair,<br/>
And from her delicate fingers slips away<br/>
Her gaudy handiwork, if haply she<br/>
Hath got the whiff at menstruation-time.<br/>
Once more, if thou delayest in hot baths,<br/>
When thou art over-full, how readily<br/>
From stool in middle of the steaming water<br/>
Thou tumblest in a fit! How readily<br/>
The heavy fumes of charcoal wind their way<br/>
Into the brain, unless beforehand we<br/>
Of water 've drunk. But when a burning fever,<br/>
O'ermastering man, hath seized upon his limbs,<br/>
Then odour of wine is like a hammer-blow.<br/>
And seest thou not how in the very earth<br/>
Sulphur is gendered and bitumen thickens<br/>
With noisome stench?&mdash;What direful stenches, too,<br/>
Scaptensula out-breathes from down below,<br/>
When men pursue the veins of silver and gold,<br/>
With pick-axe probing round the hidden realms<br/>
Deep in the earth?&mdash;Or what of deadly bane<br/>
The mines of gold exhale? O what a look,<br/>
And what a ghastly hue they give to men!<br/>
And seest thou not, or hearest, how they're wont<br/>
In little time to perish, and how fail<br/>
The life-stores in those folk whom mighty power<br/>
Of grim necessity confineth there<br/>
In such a task? Thus, this telluric earth<br/>
Out-streams with all these dread effluvia<br/>
And breathes them out into the open world<br/>
And into the visible regions under heaven.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus, too, those Birdless places must up-send<br/>
An essence bearing death to winged things,<br/>
Which from the earth rises into the breezes<br/>
To poison part of skiey space, and when<br/>
Thither the winged is on pennons borne,<br/>
There, seized by the unseen poison, 'tis ensnared,<br/>
And from the horizontal of its flight<br/>
Drops to the spot whence sprang the effluvium.<br/>
And when 'thas there collapsed, then the same power<br/>
Of that effluvium takes from all its limbs<br/>
The relics of its life. That power first strikes<br/>
The creatures with a wildering dizziness,<br/>
And then thereafter, when they're once down-fallen<br/>
Into the poison's very fountains, then<br/>
Life, too, they vomit out perforce, because<br/>
So thick the stores of bane around them fume.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Again, at times it happens that this power,<br/>
This exhalation of the Birdless places,<br/>
Dispels the air betwixt the ground and birds,<br/>
Leaving well-nigh a void. And thither when<br/>
In horizontal flight the birds have come,<br/>
Forthwith their buoyancy of pennons limps,<br/>
All useless, and each effort of both wings<br/>
Falls out in vain. Here, when without all power<br/>
To buoy themselves and on their wings to lean,<br/>
Lo, nature constrains them by their weight to slip<br/>
Down to the earth, and lying prostrate there<br/>
Along the well-nigh empty void, they spend<br/>
Their souls through all the openings of their frame.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Further, the water of wells is colder then<br/>
At summer time, because the earth by heat<br/>
Is rarefied, and sends abroad in air<br/>
Whatever seeds it peradventure have<br/>
Of its own fiery exhalations.<br/>
The more, then, the telluric ground is drained<br/>
Of heat, the colder grows the water hid<br/>
Within the earth. Further, when all the earth<br/>
Is by the cold compressed, and thus contracts<br/>
And, so to say, concretes, it happens, lo,<br/>
That by contracting it expresses then<br/>
Into the wells what heat it bears itself.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Tis said at Hammon's fane a fountain is,<br/>
In daylight cold and hot in time of night.<br/>
This fountain men be-wonder over-much,<br/>
And think that suddenly it seethes in heat<br/>
By intense sun, the subterranean, when<br/>
Night with her terrible murk hath cloaked the lands&mdash;<br/>
What's not true reasoning by a long remove:<br/>
I' faith when sun o'erhead, touching with beams<br/>
An open body of water, had no power<br/>
To render it hot upon its upper side,<br/>
Though his high light possess such burning glare,<br/>
How, then, can he, when under the gross earth,<br/>
Make water boil and glut with fiery heat?&mdash;<br/>
And, specially, since scarcely potent he<br/>
Through hedging walls of houses to inject<br/>
His exhalations hot, with ardent rays.<br/>
What, then's, the principle? Why, this, indeed:<br/>
The earth about that spring is porous more<br/>
Than elsewhere the telluric ground, and be<br/>
Many the seeds of fire hard by the water;<br/>
On this account, when night with dew-fraught shades<br/>
Hath whelmed the earth, anon the earth deep down<br/>
Grows chill, contracts; and thuswise squeezes out<br/>
Into the spring what seeds she holds of fire<br/>
(As one might squeeze with fist), which render hot<br/>
The touch and steam of the fluid. Next, when sun,<br/>
Up-risen, with his rays has split the soil<br/>
And rarefied the earth with waxing heat,<br/>
Again into their ancient abodes return<br/>
The seeds of fire, and all the Hot of water<br/>
Into the earth retires; and this is why<br/>
The fountain in the daylight gets so cold.<br/>
Besides, the water's wet is beat upon<br/>
By rays of sun, and, with the dawn, becomes<br/>
Rarer in texture under his pulsing blaze;<br/>
And, therefore, whatso seeds it holds of fire<br/>
It renders up, even as it renders oft<br/>
The frost that it contains within itself<br/>
And thaws its ice and looseneth the knots.<br/>
There is, moreover, a fountain cold in kind<br/>
That makes a bit of tow (above it held)<br/>
Take fire forthwith and shoot a flame; so, too,<br/>
A pitch-pine torch will kindle and flare round<br/>
Along its waves, wherever 'tis impelled<br/>
Afloat before the breeze. No marvel, this:<br/>
Because full many seeds of heat there be<br/>
Within the water; and, from earth itself<br/>
Out of the deeps must particles of fire<br/>
Athrough the entire fountain surge aloft,<br/>
And speed in exhalations into air<br/>
Forth and abroad (yet not in numbers enow<br/>
As to make hot the fountain). And, moreo'er,<br/>
Some force constrains them, scattered through the water,<br/>
Forthwith to burst abroad, and to combine<br/>
In flame above. Even as a fountain far<br/>
There is at Aradus amid the sea,<br/>
Which bubbles out sweet water and disparts<br/>
From round itself the salt waves; and, behold,<br/>
In many another region the broad main<br/>
Yields to the thirsty mariners timely help,<br/>
Belching sweet waters forth amid salt waves.<br/>
Just so, then, can those seeds of fire burst forth<br/>
Athrough that other fount, and bubble out<br/>
Abroad against the bit of tow; and when<br/>
They there collect or cleave unto the torch,<br/>
Forthwith they readily flash aflame, because<br/>
The tow and torches, also, in themselves<br/>
Have many seeds of latent fire. Indeed,<br/>
And seest thou not, when near the nightly lamps<br/>
Thou bringest a flaxen wick, extinguished<br/>
A moment since, it catches fire before<br/>
'Thas touched the flame, and in same wise a torch?<br/>
And many another object flashes aflame<br/>
When at a distance, touched by heat alone,<br/>
Before 'tis steeped in veritable fire.<br/>
This, then, we must suppose to come to pass<br/>
In that spring also.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to other things!<br/>
And I'll begin to treat by what decree<br/>
Of nature it came to pass that iron can be<br/>
By that stone drawn which Greeks the magnet call<br/>
After the country's name (its origin<br/>
Being in country of Magnesian folk).<br/>
This stone men marvel at; and sure it oft<br/>
Maketh a chain of rings, depending, lo,<br/>
From off itself! Nay, thou mayest see at times<br/>
Five or yet more in order dangling down<br/>
And swaying in the delicate winds, whilst one<br/>
Depends from other, cleaving to under-side,<br/>
And ilk one feels the stone's own power and bonds&mdash;<br/>
So over-masteringly its power flows down.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In things of this sort, much must be made sure<br/>
Ere thou account of the thing itself canst give,<br/>
And the approaches roundabout must be;<br/>
Wherefore the more do I exact of thee<br/>
A mind and ears attent.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, from all things<br/>
We see soever, evermore must flow,<br/>
Must be discharged and strewn about, about,<br/>
Bodies that strike the eyes, awaking sight.<br/>
From certain things flow odours evermore,<br/>
As cold from rivers, heat from sun, and spray<br/>
From waves of ocean, eater-out of walls<br/>
Along the coasts. Nor ever cease to seep<br/>
The varied echoings athrough the air.<br/>
Then, too, there comes into the mouth at times<br/>
The wet of a salt taste, when by the sea<br/>
We roam about; and so, whene'er we watch<br/>
The wormwood being mixed, its bitter stings.<br/>
To such degree from all things is each thing<br/>
Borne streamingly along, and sent about<br/>
To every region round; and nature grants<br/>
Nor rest nor respite of the onward flow,<br/>
Since 'tis incessantly we feeling have,<br/>
And all the time are suffered to descry<br/>
And smell all things at hand, and hear them sound.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now will I seek again to bring to mind<br/>
How porous a body all things have&mdash;a fact<br/>
Made manifest in my first canto, too.<br/>
For, truly, though to know this doth import<br/>
For many things, yet for this very thing<br/>
On which straightway I'm going to discourse,<br/>
'Tis needful most of all to make it sure<br/>
That naught's at hand but body mixed with void.<br/>
A first ensample: in grottos, rocks o'erhead<br/>
Sweat moisture and distil the oozy drops;<br/>
Likewise, from all our body seeps the sweat;<br/>
There grows the beard, and along our members all<br/>
And along our frame the hairs. Through all our veins<br/>
Disseminates the foods, and gives increase<br/>
And aliment down to the extreme parts,<br/>
Even to the tiniest finger-nails. Likewise,<br/>
Through solid bronze the cold and fiery heat<br/>
We feel to pass; likewise, we feel them pass<br/>
Through gold, through silver, when we clasp in hand<br/>
The brimming goblets. And, again, there flit<br/>
Voices through houses' hedging walls of stone;<br/>
Odour seeps through, and cold, and heat of fire<br/>
That's wont to penetrate even strength of iron.<br/>
Again, where corselet of the sky girds round<br/>
</p>
<p>
And at same time, some Influence of bane,<br/>
When from Beyond 'thas stolen into [our world].<br/>
And tempests, gathering from the earth and sky,<br/>
Back to the sky and earth absorbed retire&mdash;<br/>
With reason, since there's naught that's fashioned not<br/>
With body porous.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, not all<br/>
The particles which be from things thrown off<br/>
Are furnished with same qualities for sense,<br/>
Nor be for all things equally adapt.<br/>
A first ensample: the sun doth bake and parch<br/>
The earth; but ice he thaws, and with his beams<br/>
Compels the lofty snows, up-reared white<br/>
Upon the lofty hills, to waste away;<br/>
Then, wax, if set beneath the heat of him,<br/>
Melts to a liquid. And the fire, likewise,<br/>
Will melt the copper and will fuse the gold,<br/>
But hides and flesh it shrivels up and shrinks.<br/>
The water hardens the iron just off the fire,<br/>
But hides and flesh (made hard by heat) it softens.<br/>
The oleaster-tree as much delights<br/>
The bearded she-goats, verily as though<br/>
'Twere nectar-steeped and shed ambrosia;<br/>
Than which is naught that burgeons into leaf<br/>
More bitter food for man. A hog draws back<br/>
For marjoram oil, and every unguent fears<br/>
Fierce poison these unto the bristled hogs,<br/>
Yet unto us from time to time they seem,<br/>
As 'twere, to give new life. But, contrariwise,<br/>
Though unto us the mire be filth most foul,<br/>
To hogs that mire doth so delightsome seem<br/>
That they with wallowing from belly to back<br/>
Are never cloyed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point remains, besides,<br/>
Which best it seems to tell of, ere I go<br/>
To telling of the fact at hand itself.<br/>
Since to the varied things assigned be<br/>
The many pores, those pores must be diverse<br/>
In nature one from other, and each have<br/>
Its very shape, its own direction fixed.<br/>
And so, indeed, in breathing creatures be<br/>
The several senses, of which each takes in<br/>
Unto itself, in its own fashion ever,<br/>
Its own peculiar object. For we mark<br/>
How sounds do into one place penetrate,<br/>
Into another flavours of all juice,<br/>
And savour of smell into a third. Moreover,<br/>
One sort through rocks we see to seep, and, lo,<br/>
One sort to pass through wood, another still<br/>
Through gold, and others to go out and off<br/>
Through silver and through glass. For we do see<br/>
Through some pores form-and-look of things to flow,<br/>
Through others heat to go, and some things still<br/>
To speedier pass than others through same pores.<br/>
Of verity, the nature of these same paths,<br/>
Varying in many modes (as aforesaid)<br/>
Because of unlike nature and warp and woof<br/>
Of cosmic things, constrains it so to be.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Wherefore, since all these matters now have been<br/>
Established and settled well for us<br/>
As premises prepared, for what remains<br/>
'Twill not be hard to render clear account<br/>
By means of these, and the whole cause reveal<br/>
Whereby the magnet lures the strength of iron.<br/>
First, stream there must from off the lode-stone seeds<br/>
Innumerable, a very tide, which smites<br/>
By blows that air asunder lying betwixt<br/>
The stone and iron. And when is emptied out<br/>
This space, and a large place between the two<br/>
Is made a void, forthwith the primal germs<br/>
Of iron, headlong slipping, fall conjoined<br/>
Into the vacuum, and the ring itself<br/>
By reason thereof doth follow after and go<br/>
Thuswise with all its body. And naught there is<br/>
That of its own primordial elements<br/>
More thoroughly knit or tighter linked coheres<br/>
Than nature and cold roughness of stout iron.<br/>
Wherefore, 'tis less a marvel what I said,<br/>
That from such elements no bodies can<br/>
From out the iron collect in larger throng<br/>
And be into the vacuum borne along,<br/>
Without the ring itself do follow after.<br/>
And this it does, and followeth on until<br/>
'Thath reached the stone itself and cleaved to it<br/>
By links invisible. Moreover, likewise,<br/>
The motion's assisted by a thing of aid<br/>
(Whereby the process easier becomes),&mdash;<br/>
Namely, by this: as soon as rarer grows<br/>
That air in front of the ring, and space between<br/>
Is emptied more and made a void, forthwith<br/>
It happens all the air that lies behind<br/>
Conveys it onward, pushing from the rear.<br/>
For ever doth the circumambient air<br/>
Drub things unmoved, but here it pushes forth<br/>
The iron, because upon one side the space<br/>
Lies void and thus receives the iron in.<br/>
This air, whereof I am reminding thee,<br/>
Winding athrough the iron's abundant pores<br/>
So subtly into the tiny parts thereof,<br/>
Shoves it and pushes, as wind the ship and sails.<br/>
The same doth happen in all directions forth:<br/>
From whatso side a space is made a void,<br/>
Whether from crosswise or above, forthwith<br/>
The neighbour particles are borne along<br/>
Into the vacuum; for of verity,<br/>
They're set a-going by poundings from elsewhere,<br/>
Nor by themselves of own accord can they<br/>
Rise upwards into the air. Again, all things<br/>
Must in their framework hold some air, because<br/>
They are of framework porous, and the air<br/>
Encompasses and borders on all things.<br/>
Thus, then, this air in iron so deeply stored<br/>
Is tossed evermore in vexed motion,<br/>
And therefore drubs upon the ring sans doubt<br/>
And shakes it up inside....<br/>
</p>
<p>
In sooth, that ring is thither borne along<br/>
To where 'thas once plunged headlong&mdash;thither, lo,<br/>
Unto the void whereto it took its start.<br/>
</p>
<p>
It happens, too, at times that nature of iron<br/>
Shrinks from this stone away, accustomed<br/>
By turns to flee and follow. Yea, I've seen<br/>
Those Samothracian iron rings leap up,<br/>
And iron filings in the brazen bowls<br/>
Seethe furiously, when underneath was set<br/>
The magnet stone. So strongly iron seems<br/>
To crave to flee that rock. Such discord great<br/>
Is gendered by the interposed brass,<br/>
Because, forsooth, when first the tide of brass<br/>
Hath seized upon and held possession of<br/>
The iron's open passage-ways, thereafter<br/>
Cometh the tide of the stone, and in that iron<br/>
Findeth all spaces full, nor now hath holes<br/>
To swim through, as before. 'Tis thus constrained<br/>
With its own current 'gainst the iron's fabric<br/>
To dash and beat; by means whereof it spues<br/>
Forth from itself&mdash;and through the brass stirs up&mdash;<br/>
The things which otherwise without the brass<br/>
It sucks into itself. In these affairs<br/>
Marvel thou not that from this stone the tide<br/>
Prevails not likewise other things to move<br/>
With its own blows: for some stand firm by weight,<br/>
As gold; and some cannot be moved forever,<br/>
Because so porous in their framework they<br/>
That there the tide streams through without a break,<br/>
Of which sort stuff of wood is seen to be.<br/>
Therefore, when iron (which lies between the two)<br/>
Hath taken in some atoms of the brass,<br/>
Then do the streams of that Magnesian rock<br/>
Move iron by their smitings.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet these things<br/>
Are not so alien from others, that I<br/>
Of this same sort am ill prepared to name<br/>
Ensamples still of things exclusively<br/>
To one another adapt. Thou seest, first,<br/>
How lime alone cementeth stones: how wood<br/>
Only by glue-of-bull with wood is joined&mdash;<br/>
So firmly too that oftener the boards<br/>
Crack open along the weakness of the grain<br/>
Ere ever those taurine bonds will lax their hold.<br/>
The vine-born juices with the water-springs<br/>
Are bold to mix, though not the heavy pitch<br/>
With the light oil-of-olive. And purple dye<br/>
Of shell-fish so uniteth with the wool's<br/>
Body alone that it cannot be ta'en<br/>
Away forever&mdash;nay, though thou gavest toil<br/>
To restore the same with the Neptunian flood,<br/>
Nay, though all ocean willed to wash it out<br/>
With all its waves. Again, gold unto gold<br/>
Doth not one substance bind, and only one?<br/>
And is not brass by tin joined unto brass?<br/>
And other ensamples how many might one find!<br/>
What then? Nor is there unto thee a need<br/>
Of such long ways and roundabout, nor boots it<br/>
For me much toil on this to spend. More fit<br/>
It is in few words briefly to embrace<br/>
Things many: things whose textures fall together<br/>
So mutually adapt, that cavities<br/>
To solids correspond, these cavities<br/>
Of this thing to the solid parts of that,<br/>
And those of that to solid parts of this&mdash;<br/>
Such joinings are the best. Again, some things<br/>
Can be the one with other coupled and held,<br/>
Linked by hooks and eyes, as 'twere; and this<br/>
Seems more the fact with iron and this stone.<br/>
Now, of diseases what the law, and whence<br/>
The Influence of bane upgathering can<br/>
Upon the race of man and herds of cattle<br/>
Kindle a devastation fraught with death,<br/>
I will unfold. And, first, I've taught above<br/>
That seeds there be of many things to us<br/>
Life-giving, and that, contrariwise, there must<br/>
Fly many round bringing disease and death.<br/>
When these have, haply, chanced to collect<br/>
And to derange the atmosphere of earth,<br/>
The air becometh baneful. And, lo, all<br/>
That Influence of bane, that pestilence,<br/>
Or from Beyond down through our atmosphere,<br/>
Like clouds and mists, descends, or else collects<br/>
From earth herself and rises, when, a-soak<br/>
And beat by rains unseasonable and suns,<br/>
Our earth hath then contracted stench and rot.<br/>
Seest thou not, also, that whoso arrive<br/>
In region far from fatherland and home<br/>
Are by the strangeness of the clime and waters<br/>
Distempered?&mdash;since conditions vary much.<br/>
For in what else may we suppose the clime<br/>
Among the Britons to differ from Aegypt's own<br/>
(Where totters awry the axis of the world),<br/>
Or in what else to differ Pontic clime<br/>
From Gades' and from climes adown the south,<br/>
On to black generations of strong men<br/>
With sun-baked skins? Even as we thus do see<br/>
Four climes diverse under the four main-winds<br/>
And under the four main-regions of the sky,<br/>
So, too, are seen the colour and face of men<br/>
Vastly to disagree, and fixed diseases<br/>
To seize the generations, kind by kind:<br/>
There is the elephant-disease which down<br/>
In midmost Aegypt, hard by streams of Nile,<br/>
Engendered is&mdash;and never otherwhere.<br/>
In Attica the feet are oft attacked,<br/>
And in Achaean lands the eyes. And so<br/>
The divers spots to divers parts and limbs<br/>
Are noxious; 'tis a variable air<br/>
That causes this. Thus when an atmosphere,<br/>
Alien by chance to us, begins to heave,<br/>
And noxious airs begin to crawl along,<br/>
They creep and wind like unto mist and cloud,<br/>
Slowly, and everything upon their way<br/>
They disarrange and force to change its state.<br/>
It happens, too, that when they've come at last<br/>
Into this atmosphere of ours, they taint<br/>
And make it like themselves and alien.<br/>
Therefore, asudden this devastation strange,<br/>
This pestilence, upon the waters falls,<br/>
Or settles on the very crops of grain<br/>
Or other meat of men and feed of flocks.<br/>
Or it remains a subtle force, suspense<br/>
In the atmosphere itself; and when therefrom<br/>
We draw our inhalations of mixed air,<br/>
Into our body equally its bane<br/>
Also we must suck in. In manner like,<br/>
Oft comes the pestilence upon the kine,<br/>
And sickness, too, upon the sluggish sheep.<br/>
Nor aught it matters whether journey we<br/>
To regions adverse to ourselves and change<br/>
The atmospheric cloak, or whether nature<br/>
Herself import a tainted atmosphere<br/>
To us or something strange to our own use<br/>
Which can attack us soon as ever it come.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Twas such a manner of disease, 'twas such<br/>
Mortal miasma in Cecropian lands<br/>
Whilom reduced the plains to dead men's bones,<br/>
Unpeopled the highways, drained of citizens<br/>
The Athenian town. For coming from afar,<br/>
Rising in lands of Aegypt, traversing<br/>
Reaches of air and floating fields of foam,<br/>
At last on all Pandion's folk it swooped;<br/>
Whereat by troops unto disease and death<br/>
Were they o'er-given. At first, they'd bear about<br/>
A skull on fire with heat, and eyeballs twain<br/>
Red with suffusion of blank glare. Their throats,<br/>
Black on the inside, sweated oozy blood;<br/>
And the walled pathway of the voice of man<br/>
Was clogged with ulcers; and the very tongue,<br/>
The mind's interpreter, would trickle gore,<br/>
Weakened by torments, tardy, rough to touch.<br/>
Next when that Influence of bane had chocked,<br/>
Down through the throat, the breast, and streamed had<br/>
E'en into sullen heart of those sick folk,<br/>
Then, verily, all the fences of man's life<br/>
Began to topple. From the mouth the breath<br/>
Would roll a noisome stink, as stink to heaven<br/>
Rotting cadavers flung unburied out.<br/>
And, lo, thereafter, all the body's strength<br/>
And every power of mind would languish, now<br/>
In very doorway of destruction.<br/>
And anxious anguish and ululation (mixed<br/>
With many a groan) companioned alway<br/>
The intolerable torments. Night and day,<br/>
Recurrent spasms of vomiting would rack<br/>
Alway their thews and members, breaking down<br/>
With sheer exhaustion men already spent.<br/>
And yet on no one's body couldst thou mark<br/>
The skin with o'er-much heat to burn aglow,<br/>
But rather the body unto touch of hands<br/>
Would offer a warmish feeling, and thereby<br/>
Show red all over, with ulcers, so to say,<br/>
Inbranded, like the "sacred fires" o'erspread<br/>
Along the members. The inward parts of men,<br/>
In truth, would blaze unto the very bones;<br/>
A flame, like flame in furnaces, would blaze<br/>
Within the stomach. Nor couldst aught apply<br/>
Unto their members light enough and thin<br/>
For shift of aid&mdash;but coolness and a breeze<br/>
Ever and ever. Some would plunge those limbs<br/>
On fire with bane into the icy streams,<br/>
Hurling the body naked into the waves;<br/>
Many would headlong fling them deeply down<br/>
The water-pits, tumbling with eager mouth<br/>
Already agape. The insatiable thirst<br/>
That whelmed their parched bodies, lo, would make<br/>
A goodly shower seem like to scanty drops.<br/>
Respite of torment was there none. Their frames<br/>
Forspent lay prone. With silent lips of fear<br/>
Would Medicine mumble low, the while she saw<br/>
So many a time men roll their eyeballs round,<br/>
Staring wide-open, unvisited of sleep,<br/>
The heralds of old death. And in those months<br/>
Was given many another sign of death:<br/>
The intellect of mind by sorrow and dread<br/>
Deranged, the sad brow, the countenance<br/>
Fierce and delirious, the tormented ears<br/>
Beset with ringings, the breath quick and short<br/>
Or huge and intermittent, soaking sweat<br/>
A-glisten on neck, the spittle in fine gouts<br/>
Tainted with colour of crocus and so salt,<br/>
The cough scarce wheezing through the rattling throat.<br/>
Aye, and the sinews in the fingered hands<br/>
Were sure to contract, and sure the jointed frame<br/>
To shiver, and up from feet the cold to mount<br/>
Inch after inch: and toward the supreme hour<br/>
At last the pinched nostrils, nose's tip<br/>
A very point, eyes sunken, temples hollow,<br/>
Skin cold and hard, the shuddering grimace,<br/>
The pulled and puffy flesh above the brows!&mdash;<br/>
O not long after would their frames lie prone<br/>
In rigid death. And by about the eighth<br/>
Resplendent light of sun, or at the most<br/>
On the ninth flaming of his flambeau, they<br/>
Would render up the life. If any then<br/>
Had 'scaped the doom of that destruction, yet<br/>
Him there awaited in the after days<br/>
A wasting and a death from ulcers vile<br/>
And black discharges of the belly, or else<br/>
Through the clogged nostrils would there ooze along<br/>
Much fouled blood, oft with an aching head:<br/>
Hither would stream a man's whole strength and flesh.<br/>
And whoso had survived that virulent flow<br/>
Of the vile blood, yet into thews of him<br/>
And into his joints and very genitals<br/>
Would pass the old disease. And some there were,<br/>
Dreading the doorways of destruction<br/>
So much, lived on, deprived by the knife<br/>
Of the male member; not a few, though lopped<br/>
Of hands and feet, would yet persist in life,<br/>
And some there were who lost their eyeballs: O<br/>
So fierce a fear of death had fallen on them!<br/>
And some, besides, were by oblivion<br/>
Of all things seized, that even themselves they knew<br/>
No longer. And though corpse on corpse lay piled<br/>
Unburied on ground, the race of birds and beasts<br/>
Would or spring back, scurrying to escape<br/>
The virulent stench, or, if they'd tasted there,<br/>
Would languish in approaching death. But yet<br/>
Hardly at all during those many suns<br/>
Appeared a fowl, nor from the woods went forth<br/>
The sullen generations of wild beasts&mdash;<br/>
They languished with disease and died and died.<br/>
In chief, the faithful dogs, in all the streets<br/>
Outstretched, would yield their breath distressfully<br/>
For so that Influence of bane would twist<br/>
Life from their members. Nor was found one sure<br/>
And universal principle of cure:<br/>
For what to one had given the power to take<br/>
The vital winds of air into his mouth,<br/>
And to gaze upward at the vaults of sky,<br/>
The same to others was their death and doom.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In those affairs, O awfullest of all,<br/>
O pitiable most was this, was this:<br/>
Whoso once saw himself in that disease<br/>
Entangled, ay, as damned unto death,<br/>
Would lie in wanhope, with a sullen heart,<br/>
Would, in fore-vision of his funeral,<br/>
Give up the ghost, O then and there. For, lo,<br/>
At no time did they cease one from another<br/>
To catch contagion of the greedy plague,&mdash;<br/>
As though but woolly flocks and horned herds;<br/>
And this in chief would heap the dead on dead:<br/>
For who forbore to look to their own sick,<br/>
O these (too eager of life, of death afeard)<br/>
Would then, soon after, slaughtering Neglect<br/>
Visit with vengeance of evil death and base&mdash;<br/>
Themselves deserted and forlorn of help.<br/>
But who had stayed at hand would perish there<br/>
By that contagion and the toil which then<br/>
A sense of honour and the pleading voice<br/>
Of weary watchers, mixed with voice of wail<br/>
Of dying folk, forced them to undergo.<br/>
This kind of death each nobler soul would meet.<br/>
The funerals, uncompanioned, forsaken,<br/>
Like rivals contended to be hurried through.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And men contending to ensepulchre<br/>
Pile upon pile the throng of their own dead:<br/>
And weary with woe and weeping wandered home;<br/>
And then the most would take to bed from grief.<br/>
Nor could be found not one, whom nor disease<br/>
Nor death, nor woe had not in those dread times<br/>
Attacked.<br/>
</p>
<p>
By now the shepherds and neatherds all,<br/>
Yea, even the sturdy guiders of curved ploughs,<br/>
Began to sicken, and their bodies would lie<br/>
Huddled within back-corners of their huts,<br/>
Delivered by squalor and disease to death.<br/>
O often and often couldst thou then have seen<br/>
On lifeless children lifeless parents prone,<br/>
Or offspring on their fathers', mothers' corpse<br/>
Yielding the life. And into the city poured<br/>
O not in least part from the countryside<br/>
That tribulation, which the peasantry<br/>
Sick, sick, brought thither, thronging from every quarter,<br/>
Plague-stricken mob. All places would they crowd,<br/>
All buildings too; whereby the more would death<br/>
Up-pile a-heap the folk so crammed in town.<br/>
Ah, many a body thirst had dragged and rolled<br/>
Along the highways there was lying strewn<br/>
Besides Silenus-headed water-fountains,&mdash;<br/>
The life-breath choked from that too dear desire<br/>
Of pleasant waters. Ah, everywhere along<br/>
The open places of the populace,<br/>
And along the highways, O thou mightest see<br/>
Of many a half-dead body the sagged limbs,<br/>
Rough with squalor, wrapped around with rags,<br/>
Perish from very nastiness, with naught<br/>
But skin upon the bones, well-nigh already<br/>
Buried&mdash;in ulcers vile and obscene filth.<br/>
All holy temples, too, of deities<br/>
Had Death becrammed with the carcasses;<br/>
And stood each fane of the Celestial Ones<br/>
Laden with stark cadavers everywhere&mdash;<br/>
Places which warders of the shrines had crowded<br/>
With many a guest. For now no longer men<br/>
Did mightily esteem the old Divine,<br/>
The worship of the gods: the woe at hand<br/>
Did over-master. Nor in the city then<br/>
Remained those rites of sepulture, with which<br/>
That pious folk had evermore been wont<br/>
To buried be. For it was wildered all<br/>
In wild alarms, and each and every one<br/>
With sullen sorrow would bury his own dead,<br/>
As present shift allowed. And sudden stress<br/>
And poverty to many an awful act<br/>
Impelled; and with a monstrous screaming they<br/>
Would, on the frames of alien funeral pyres,<br/>
Place their own kin, and thrust the torch beneath<br/>
Oft brawling with much bloodshed round about<br/>
Rather than quit dead bodies loved in life.<br/>

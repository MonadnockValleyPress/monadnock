<h1>The Nature of Things</h1>
<h2>by Lucretius</h2>
<h3>Book II</h3>
<p>
'Tis sweet, when, down the mighty main, the winds<br/>
Roll up its waste of waters, from the land<br/>
To watch another's labouring anguish far,<br/>
Not that we joyously delight that man<br/>
Should thus be smitten, but because 'tis sweet<br/>
To mark what evils we ourselves be spared;<br/>
'Tis sweet, again, to view the mighty strife<br/>
Of armies embattled yonder o'er the plains,<br/>
Ourselves no sharers in the peril; but naught<br/>
There is more goodly than to hold the high<br/>
Serene plateaus, well fortressed by the wise,<br/>
Whence thou may'st look below on other men<br/>
And see them ev'rywhere wand'ring, all dispersed<br/>
In their lone seeking for the road of life;<br/>
Rivals in genius, or emulous in rank,<br/>
Pressing through days and nights with hugest toil<br/>
For summits of power and mastery of the world.<br/>
O wretched minds of men! O blinded hearts!<br/>
In how great perils, in what darks of life<br/>
Are spent the human years, however brief!&mdash;<br/>
O not to see that nature for herself<br/>
Barks after nothing, save that pain keep off,<br/>
Disjoined from the body, and that mind enjoy<br/>
Delightsome feeling, far from care and fear!<br/>
Therefore we see that our corporeal life<br/>
Needs little, altogether, and only such<br/>
As takes the pain away, and can besides<br/>
Strew underneath some number of delights.<br/>
More grateful 'tis at times (for nature craves<br/>
No artifice nor luxury), if forsooth<br/>
There be no golden images of boys<br/>
Along the halls, with right hands holding out<br/>
The lamps ablaze, the lights for evening feasts,<br/>
And if the house doth glitter not with gold<br/>
Nor gleam with silver, and to the lyre resound<br/>
No fretted and gilded ceilings overhead,<br/>
Yet still to lounge with friends in the soft grass<br/>
Beside a river of water, underneath<br/>
A big tree's boughs, and merrily to refresh<br/>
Our frames, with no vast outlay&mdash;most of all<br/>
If the weather is laughing and the times of the year<br/>
Besprinkle the green of the grass around with flowers.<br/>
Nor yet the quicker will hot fevers go,<br/>
If on a pictured tapestry thou toss,<br/>
Or purple robe, than if 'tis thine to lie<br/>
Upon the poor man's bedding. Wherefore, since<br/>
Treasure, nor rank, nor glory of a reign<br/>
Avail us naught for this our body, thus<br/>
Reckon them likewise nothing for the mind:<br/>
Save then perchance, when thou beholdest forth<br/>
Thy legions swarming round the Field of Mars,<br/>
Rousing a mimic warfare&mdash;either side<br/>
Strengthened with large auxiliaries and horse,<br/>
Alike equipped with arms, alike inspired;<br/>
Or save when also thou beholdest forth<br/>
Thy fleets to swarm, deploying down the sea:<br/>
For then, by such bright circumstance abashed,<br/>
Religion pales and flees thy mind; O then<br/>
The fears of death leave heart so free of care.<br/>
But if we note how all this pomp at last<br/>
Is but a drollery and a mocking sport,<br/>
And of a truth man's dread, with cares at heels,<br/>
Dreads not these sounds of arms, these savage swords<br/>
But among kings and lords of all the world<br/>
Mingles undaunted, nor is overawed<br/>
By gleam of gold nor by the splendour bright<br/>
Of purple robe, canst thou then doubt that this<br/>
Is aught, but power of thinking?&mdash;when, besides<br/>
The whole of life but labours in the dark.<br/>
For just as children tremble and fear all<br/>
In the viewless dark, so even we at times<br/>
Dread in the light so many things that be<br/>
No whit more fearsome than what children feign,<br/>
Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark.<br/>
This terror then, this darkness of the mind,<br/>
Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,<br/>
Nor glittering arrows of morning can disperse,<br/>
But only nature's aspect and her law.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now come: I will untangle for thy steps<br/>
Now by what motions the begetting bodies<br/>
Of the world-stuff beget the varied world,<br/>
And then forever resolve it when begot,<br/>
And by what force they are constrained to this,<br/>
And what the speed appointed unto them<br/>
Wherewith to travel down the vast inane:<br/>
Do thou remember to yield thee to my words.<br/>
For truly matter coheres not, crowds not tight,<br/>
Since we behold each thing to wane away,<br/>
And we observe how all flows on and off,<br/>
As 'twere, with age-old time, and from our eyes<br/>
How eld withdraws each object at the end,<br/>
Albeit the sum is seen to bide the same,<br/>
Unharmed, because these motes that leave each thing<br/>
Diminish what they part from, but endow<br/>
With increase those to which in turn they come,<br/>
Constraining these to wither in old age,<br/>
And those to flower at the prime (and yet<br/>
Biding not long among them). Thus the sum<br/>
Forever is replenished, and we live<br/>
As mortals by eternal give and take.<br/>
The nations wax, the nations wane away;<br/>
In a brief space the generations pass,<br/>
And like to runners hand the lamp of life<br/>
One unto other.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if thou believe<br/>
That the primordial germs of things can stop,<br/>
And in their stopping give new motions birth,<br/>
Afar thou wanderest from the road of truth.<br/>
For since they wander through the void inane,<br/>
All the primordial germs of things must needs<br/>
Be borne along, either by weight their own,<br/>
Or haply by another's blow without.<br/>
For, when, in their incessancy so oft<br/>
They meet and clash, it comes to pass amain<br/>
They leap asunder, face to face: not strange&mdash;<br/>
Being most hard, and solid in their weights,<br/>
And naught opposing motion, from behind.<br/>
And that more clearly thou perceive how all<br/>
These mites of matter are darted round about,<br/>
Recall to mind how nowhere in the sum<br/>
Of All exists a bottom,&mdash;nowhere is<br/>
A realm of rest for primal bodies; since<br/>
(As amply shown and proved by reason sure)<br/>
Space has no bound nor measure, and extends<br/>
Unmetered forth in all directions round.<br/>
Since this stands certain, thus 'tis out of doubt<br/>
No rest is rendered to the primal bodies<br/>
Along the unfathomable inane; but rather,<br/>
Inveterately plied by motions mixed,<br/>
Some, at their jamming, bound aback and leave<br/>
Huge gaps between, and some from off the blow<br/>
Are hurried about with spaces small between.<br/>
And all which, brought together with slight gaps,<br/>
In more condensed union bound aback,<br/>
Linked by their own all inter-tangled shapes,&mdash;<br/>
These form the irrefragable roots of rocks<br/>
And the brute bulks of iron, and what else<br/>
Is of their kind...<br/>
The rest leap far asunder, far recoil,<br/>
Leaving huge gaps between: and these supply<br/>
For us thin air and splendour-lights of the sun.<br/>
And many besides wander the mighty void&mdash;<br/>
Cast back from unions of existing things,<br/>
Nowhere accepted in the universe,<br/>
And nowise linked in motions to the rest.<br/>
And of this fact (as I record it here)<br/>
An image, a type goes on before our eyes<br/>
Present each moment; for behold whenever<br/>
The sun's light and the rays, let in, pour down<br/>
Across dark halls of houses: thou wilt see<br/>
The many mites in many a manner mixed<br/>
Amid a void in the very light of the rays,<br/>
And battling on, as in eternal strife,<br/>
And in battalions contending without halt,<br/>
In meetings, partings, harried up and down.<br/>
From this thou mayest conjecture of what sort<br/>
The ceaseless tossing of primordial seeds<br/>
Amid the mightier void&mdash;at least so far<br/>
As small affair can for a vaster serve,<br/>
And by example put thee on the spoor<br/>
Of knowledge. For this reason too 'tis fit<br/>
Thou turn thy mind the more unto these bodies<br/>
Which here are witnessed tumbling in the light:<br/>
Namely, because such tumblings are a sign<br/>
That motions also of the primal stuff<br/>
Secret and viewless lurk beneath, behind.<br/>
For thou wilt mark here many a speck, impelled<br/>
By viewless blows, to change its little course,<br/>
And beaten backwards to return again,<br/>
Hither and thither in all directions round.<br/>
Lo, all their shifting movement is of old,<br/>
From the primeval atoms; for the same<br/>
Primordial seeds of things first move of self,<br/>
And then those bodies built of unions small<br/>
And nearest, as it were, unto the powers<br/>
Of the primeval atoms, are stirred up<br/>
By impulse of those atoms' unseen blows,<br/>
And these thereafter goad the next in size:<br/>
Thus motion ascends from the primevals on,<br/>
And stage by stage emerges to our sense,<br/>
Until those objects also move which we<br/>
Can mark in sunbeams, though it not appears<br/>
What blows do urge them.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein wonder not<br/>
How 'tis that, while the seeds of things are all<br/>
Moving forever, the sum yet seems to stand<br/>
Supremely still, except in cases where<br/>
A thing shows motion of its frame as whole.<br/>
For far beneath the ken of senses lies<br/>
The nature of those ultimates of the world;<br/>
And so, since those themselves thou canst not see,<br/>
Their motion also must they veil from men&mdash;<br/>
For mark, indeed, how things we can see, oft<br/>
Yet hide their motions, when afar from us<br/>
Along the distant landscape. Often thus,<br/>
Upon a hillside will the woolly flocks<br/>
Be cropping their goodly food and creeping about<br/>
Whither the summons of the grass, begemmed<br/>
With the fresh dew, is calling, and the lambs,<br/>
Well filled, are frisking, locking horns in sport:<br/>
Yet all for us seem blurred and blent afar&mdash;<br/>
A glint of white at rest on a green hill.<br/>
Again, when mighty legions, marching round,<br/>
Fill all the quarters of the plains below,<br/>
Rousing a mimic warfare, there the sheen<br/>
Shoots up the sky, and all the fields about<br/>
Glitter with brass, and from beneath, a sound<br/>
Goes forth from feet of stalwart soldiery,<br/>
And mountain walls, smote by the shouting, send<br/>
The voices onward to the stars of heaven,<br/>
And hither and thither darts the cavalry,<br/>
And of a sudden down the midmost fields<br/>
Charges with onset stout enough to rock<br/>
The solid earth: and yet some post there is<br/>
Up the high mountains, viewed from which they seem<br/>
To stand&mdash;a gleam at rest along the plains.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now what the speed to matter's atoms given<br/>
Thou mayest in few, my Memmius, learn from this:<br/>
When first the dawn is sprinkling with new light<br/>
The lands, and all the breed of birds abroad<br/>
Flit round the trackless forests, with liquid notes<br/>
Filling the regions along the mellow air,<br/>
We see 'tis forthwith manifest to man<br/>
How suddenly the risen sun is wont<br/>
At such an hour to overspread and clothe<br/>
The whole with its own splendour; but the sun's<br/>
Warm exhalations and this serene light<br/>
Travel not down an empty void; and thus<br/>
They are compelled more slowly to advance,<br/>
Whilst, as it were, they cleave the waves of air;<br/>
Nor one by one travel these particles<br/>
Of the warm exhalations, but are all<br/>
Entangled and enmassed, whereby at once<br/>
Each is restrained by each, and from without<br/>
Checked, till compelled more slowly to advance.<br/>
But the primordial atoms with their old<br/>
Simple solidity, when forth they travel<br/>
Along the empty void, all undelayed<br/>
By aught outside them there, and they, each one<br/>
Being one unit from nature of its parts,<br/>
Are borne to that one place on which they strive<br/>
Still to lay hold, must then, beyond a doubt,<br/>
Outstrip in speed, and be more swiftly borne<br/>
Than light of sun, and over regions rush,<br/>
Of space much vaster, in the self-same time<br/>
The sun's effulgence widens round the sky.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor to pursue the atoms one by one,<br/>
To see the law whereby each thing goes on.<br/>
But some men, ignorant of matter, think,<br/>
Opposing this, that not without the gods,<br/>
In such adjustment to our human ways,<br/>
Can nature change the seasons of the years,<br/>
And bring to birth the grains and all of else<br/>
To which divine Delight, the guide of life,<br/>
Persuades mortality and leads it on,<br/>
That, through her artful blandishments of love,<br/>
It propagate the generations still,<br/>
Lest humankind should perish. When they feign<br/>
That gods have stablished all things but for man,<br/>
They seem in all ways mightily to lapse<br/>
From reason's truth: for ev'n if ne'er I knew<br/>
What seeds primordial are, yet would I dare<br/>
This to affirm, ev'n from deep judgment based<br/>
Upon the ways and conduct of the skies&mdash;<br/>
This to maintain by many a fact besides&mdash;<br/>
That in no wise the nature of the world<br/>
For us was builded by a power divine&mdash;<br/>
So great the faults it stands encumbered with:<br/>
The which, my Memmius, later on, for thee<br/>
We will clear up. Now as to what remains<br/>
Concerning motions we'll unfold our thought.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now is the place, meseems, in these affairs<br/>
To prove for thee this too: nothing corporeal<br/>
Of its own force can e'er be upward borne,<br/>
Or upward go&mdash;nor let the bodies of flames<br/>
Deceive thee here: for they engendered are<br/>
With urge to upwards, taking thus increase,<br/>
Whereby grow upwards shining grains and trees,<br/>
Though all the weight within them downward bears.<br/>
Nor, when the fires will leap from under round<br/>
The roofs of houses, and swift flame laps up<br/>
Timber and beam, 'tis then to be supposed<br/>
They act of own accord, no force beneath<br/>
To urge them up. 'Tis thus that blood, discharged<br/>
From out our bodies, spurts its jets aloft<br/>
And spatters gore. And hast thou never marked<br/>
With what a force the water will disgorge<br/>
Timber and beam? The deeper, straight and down,<br/>
We push them in, and, many though we be,<br/>
The more we press with main and toil, the more<br/>
The water vomits up and flings them back,<br/>
That, more than half their length, they there emerge,<br/>
Rebounding. Yet we never doubt, meseems,<br/>
That all the weight within them downward bears<br/>
Through empty void. Well, in like manner, flames<br/>
Ought also to be able, when pressed out,<br/>
Through winds of air to rise aloft, even though<br/>
The weight within them strive to draw them down.<br/>
Hast thou not seen, sweeping so far and high,<br/>
The meteors, midnight flambeaus of the sky,<br/>
How after them they draw long trails of flame<br/>
Wherever Nature gives a thoroughfare?<br/>
How stars and constellations drop to earth,<br/>
Seest not? Nay, too, the sun from peak of heaven<br/>
Sheds round to every quarter its large heat,<br/>
And sows the new-ploughed intervales with light:<br/>
Thus also sun's heat downward tends to earth.<br/>
Athwart the rain thou seest the lightning fly;<br/>
Now here, now there, bursting from out the clouds,<br/>
The fires dash zig-zag&mdash;and that flaming power<br/>
Falls likewise down to earth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these affairs<br/>
We wish thee also well aware of this:<br/>
The atoms, as their own weight bears them down<br/>
Plumb through the void, at scarce determined times,<br/>
In scarce determined places, from their course<br/>
Decline a little&mdash;call it, so to speak,<br/>
Mere changed trend. For were it not their wont<br/>
Thuswise to swerve, down would they fall, each one,<br/>
Like drops of rain, through the unbottomed void;<br/>
And then collisions ne'er could be nor blows<br/>
Among the primal elements; and thus<br/>
Nature would never have created aught.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But, if perchance be any that believe<br/>
The heavier bodies, as more swiftly borne<br/>
Plumb down the void, are able from above<br/>
To strike the lighter, thus engendering blows<br/>
Able to cause those procreant motions, far<br/>
From highways of true reason they retire.<br/>
For whatsoever through the waters fall,<br/>
Or through thin air, must quicken their descent,<br/>
Each after its weight&mdash;on this account, because<br/>
Both bulk of water and the subtle air<br/>
By no means can retard each thing alike,<br/>
But give more quick before the heavier weight;<br/>
But contrariwise the empty void cannot,<br/>
On any side, at any time, to aught<br/>
Oppose resistance, but will ever yield,<br/>
True to its bent of nature. Wherefore all,<br/>
With equal speed, though equal not in weight,<br/>
Must rush, borne downward through the still inane.<br/>
Thus ne'er at all have heavier from above<br/>
Been swift to strike the lighter, gendering strokes<br/>
Which cause those divers motions, by whose means<br/>
Nature transacts her work. And so I say,<br/>
The atoms must a little swerve at times&mdash;<br/>
But only the least, lest we should seem to feign<br/>
Motions oblique, and fact refute us there.<br/>
For this we see forthwith is manifest:<br/>
Whatever the weight, it can't obliquely go,<br/>
Down on its headlong journey from above,<br/>
At least so far as thou canst mark; but who<br/>
Is there can mark by sense that naught can swerve<br/>
At all aside from off its road's straight line?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Again, if ev'r all motions are co-linked,<br/>
And from the old ever arise the new<br/>
In fixed order, and primordial seeds<br/>
Produce not by their swerving some new start<br/>
Of motion to sunder the covenants of fate,<br/>
That cause succeed not cause from everlasting,<br/>
Whence this free will for creatures o'er the lands,<br/>
Whence is it wrested from the fates,&mdash;this will<br/>
Whereby we step right forward where desire<br/>
Leads each man on, whereby the same we swerve<br/>
In motions, not as at some fixed time,<br/>
Nor at some fixed line of space, but where<br/>
The mind itself has urged? For out of doubt<br/>
In these affairs 'tis each man's will itself<br/>
That gives the start, and hence throughout our limbs<br/>
Incipient motions are diffused. Again,<br/>
Dost thou not see, when, at a point of time,<br/>
The bars are opened, how the eager strength<br/>
Of horses cannot forward break as soon<br/>
As pants their mind to do? For it behooves<br/>
That all the stock of matter, through the frame,<br/>
Be roused, in order that, through every joint,<br/>
Aroused, it press and follow mind's desire;<br/>
So thus thou seest initial motion's gendered<br/>
From out the heart, aye, verily, proceeds<br/>
First from the spirit's will, whence at the last<br/>
'Tis given forth through joints and body entire.<br/>
Quite otherwise it is, when forth we move,<br/>
Impelled by a blow of another's mighty powers<br/>
And mighty urge; for then 'tis clear enough<br/>
All matter of our total body goes,<br/>
Hurried along, against our own desire&mdash;<br/>
Until the will has pulled upon the reins<br/>
And checked it back, throughout our members all;<br/>
At whose arbitrament indeed sometimes<br/>
The stock of matter's forced to change its path,<br/>
Throughout our members and throughout our joints,<br/>
And, after being forward cast, to be<br/>
Reined up, whereat it settles back again.<br/>
So seest thou not, how, though external force<br/>
Drive men before, and often make them move,<br/>
Onward against desire, and headlong snatched,<br/>
Yet is there something in these breasts of ours<br/>
Strong to combat, strong to withstand the same?&mdash;<br/>
Wherefore no less within the primal seeds<br/>
Thou must admit, besides all blows and weight,<br/>
Some other cause of motion, whence derives<br/>
This power in us inborn, of some free act.&mdash;<br/>
Since naught from nothing can become, we see.<br/>
For weight prevents all things should come to pass<br/>
Through blows, as 'twere, by some external force;<br/>
But that man's mind itself in all it does<br/>
Hath not a fixed necessity within,<br/>
Nor is not, like a conquered thing, compelled<br/>
To bear and suffer,&mdash;this state comes to man<br/>
From that slight swervement of the elements<br/>
In no fixed line of space, in no fixed time.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor ever was the stock of stuff more crammed,<br/>
Nor ever, again, sundered by bigger gaps:<br/>
For naught gives increase and naught takes away;<br/>
On which account, just as they move to-day,<br/>
The elemental bodies moved of old<br/>
And shall the same hereafter evermore.<br/>
And what was wont to be begot of old<br/>
Shall be begotten under selfsame terms<br/>
And grow and thrive in power, so far as given<br/>
To each by Nature's changeless, old decrees.<br/>
The sum of things there is no power can change,<br/>
For naught exists outside, to which can flee<br/>
Out of the world matter of any kind,<br/>
Nor forth from which a fresh supply can spring,<br/>
Break in upon the founded world, and change<br/>
Whole nature of things, and turn their motions about.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now come, and next hereafter apprehend<br/>
What sorts, how vastly different in form,<br/>
How varied in multitudinous shapes they are&mdash;<br/>
These old beginnings of the universe;<br/>
Not in the sense that only few are furnished<br/>
With one like form, but rather not at all<br/>
In general have they likeness each with each,<br/>
No marvel: since the stock of them's so great<br/>
That there's no end (as I have taught) nor sum,<br/>
They must indeed not one and all be marked<br/>
By equal outline and by shape the same.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Moreover, humankind, and the mute flocks<br/>
Of scaly creatures swimming in the streams,<br/>
And joyous herds around, and all the wild,<br/>
And all the breeds of birds&mdash;both those that teem<br/>
In gladsome regions of the water-haunts,<br/>
About the river-banks and springs and pools,<br/>
And those that throng, flitting from tree to tree,<br/>
Through trackless woods&mdash;Go, take which one thou wilt,<br/>
In any kind: thou wilt discover still<br/>
Each from the other still unlike in shape.<br/>
Nor in no other wise could offspring know<br/>
Mother, nor mother offspring&mdash;which we see<br/>
They yet can do, distinguished one from other,<br/>
No less than human beings, by clear signs.<br/>
Thus oft before fair temples of the gods,<br/>
Beside the incense-burning altars slain,<br/>
Drops down the yearling calf, from out its breast<br/>
Breathing warm streams of blood; the orphaned mother,<br/>
Ranging meanwhile green woodland pastures round,<br/>
Knows well the footprints, pressed by cloven hoofs,<br/>
With eyes regarding every spot about,<br/>
For sight somewhere of youngling gone from her;<br/>
And, stopping short, filleth the leafy lanes<br/>
With her complaints; and oft she seeks again<br/>
Within the stall, pierced by her yearning still.<br/>
Nor tender willows, nor dew-quickened grass,<br/>
Nor the loved streams that glide along low banks,<br/>
Can lure her mind and turn the sudden pain;<br/>
Nor other shapes of calves that graze thereby<br/>
Distract her mind or lighten pain the least&mdash;<br/>
So keen her search for something known and hers.<br/>
Moreover, tender kids with bleating throats<br/>
Do know their horned dams, and butting lambs<br/>
The flocks of sheep, and thus they patter on,<br/>
Unfailingly each to its proper teat,<br/>
As nature intends. Lastly, with any grain,<br/>
Thou'lt see that no one kernel in one kind<br/>
Is so far like another, that there still<br/>
Is not in shapes some difference running through.<br/>
By a like law we see how earth is pied<br/>
With shells and conchs, where, with soft waves, the sea<br/>
Beats on the thirsty sands of curving shores.<br/>
Wherefore again, again, since seeds of things<br/>
Exist by nature, nor were wrought with hands<br/>
After a fixed pattern of one other,<br/>
They needs must flitter to and fro with shapes<br/>
In types dissimilar to one another.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Easy enough by thought of mind to solve<br/>
Why fires of lightning more can penetrate<br/>
Than these of ours from pitch-pine born on earth.<br/>
For thou canst say lightning's celestial fire,<br/>
So subtle, is formed of figures finer far,<br/>
And passes thus through holes which this our fire,<br/>
Born from the wood, created from the pine,<br/>
Cannot. Again, light passes through the horn<br/>
On the lantern's side, while rain is dashed away.<br/>
And why?&mdash;unless those bodies of light should be<br/>
Finer than those of water's genial showers.<br/>
We see how quickly through a colander<br/>
The wines will flow; how, on the other hand,<br/>
The sluggish olive-oil delays: no doubt,<br/>
Because 'tis wrought of elements more large,<br/>
Or else more crook'd and intertangled. Thus<br/>
It comes that the primordials cannot be<br/>
So suddenly sundered one from other, and seep,<br/>
One through each several hole of anything.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And note, besides, that liquor of honey or milk<br/>
Yields in the mouth agreeable taste to tongue,<br/>
Whilst nauseous wormwood, pungent centaury,<br/>
With their foul flavour set the lips awry;<br/>
Thus simple 'tis to see that whatsoever<br/>
Can touch the senses pleasingly are made<br/>
Of smooth and rounded elements, whilst those<br/>
Which seem the bitter and the sharp, are held<br/>
Entwined by elements more crook'd, and so<br/>
Are wont to tear their ways into our senses,<br/>
And rend our body as they enter in.<br/>
In short all good to sense, all bad to touch,<br/>
Being up-built of figures so unlike,<br/>
Are mutually at strife&mdash;lest thou suppose<br/>
That the shrill rasping of a squeaking saw<br/>
Consists of elements as smooth as song<br/>
Which, waked by nimble fingers, on the strings<br/>
The sweet musicians fashion; or suppose<br/>
That same-shaped atoms through men's nostrils pierce<br/>
When foul cadavers burn, as when the stage<br/>
Is with Cilician saffron sprinkled fresh,<br/>
And the altar near exhales Panchaean scent;<br/>
Or hold as of like seed the goodly hues<br/>
Of things which feast our eyes, as those which sting<br/>
Against the smarting pupil and draw tears,<br/>
Or show, with gruesome aspect, grim and vile.<br/>
For never a shape which charms our sense was made<br/>
Without some elemental smoothness; whilst<br/>
Whate'er is harsh and irksome has been framed<br/>
Still with some roughness in its elements.<br/>
Some, too, there are which justly are supposed<br/>
To be nor smooth nor altogether hooked,<br/>
With bended barbs, but slightly angled-out,<br/>
To tickle rather than to wound the sense&mdash;<br/>
And of which sort is the salt tartar of wine<br/>
And flavours of the gummed elecampane.<br/>
Again, that glowing fire and icy rime<br/>
Are fanged with teeth unlike whereby to sting<br/>
Our body's sense, the touch of each gives proof.<br/>
For touch&mdash;by sacred majesties of Gods!&mdash;<br/>
Touch is indeed the body's only sense&mdash;<br/>
Be't that something in-from-outward works,<br/>
Be't that something in the body born<br/>
Wounds, or delighteth as it passes out<br/>
Along the procreant paths of Aphrodite;<br/>
Or be't the seeds by some collision whirl<br/>
Disordered in the body and confound<br/>
By tumult and confusion all the sense&mdash;<br/>
As thou mayst find, if haply with the hand<br/>
Thyself thou strike thy body's any part.<br/>
On which account, the elemental forms<br/>
Must differ widely, as enabled thus<br/>
To cause diverse sensations.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, again,<br/>
What seems to us the hardened and condensed<br/>
Must be of atoms among themselves more hooked,<br/>
Be held compacted deep within, as 'twere<br/>
By branch-like atoms&mdash;of which sort the chief<br/>
Are diamond stones, despisers of all blows,<br/>
And stalwart flint and strength of solid iron,<br/>
And brazen bars, which, budging hard in locks,<br/>
Do grate and scream. But what are liquid, formed<br/>
Of fluid body, they indeed must be<br/>
Of elements more smooth and round&mdash;because<br/>
Their globules severally will not cohere:<br/>
To suck the poppy-seeds from palm of hand<br/>
Is quite as easy as drinking water down,<br/>
And they, once struck, roll like unto the same.<br/>
But that thou seest among the things that flow<br/>
Some bitter, as the brine of ocean is,<br/>
Is not the least a marvel...<br/>
For since 'tis fluid, smooth its atoms are<br/>
And round, with painful rough ones mixed therein;<br/>
Yet need not these be held together hooked:<br/>
In fact, though rough, they're globular besides,<br/>
Able at once to roll, and rasp the sense.<br/>
And that the more thou mayst believe me here,<br/>
That with smooth elements are mixed the rough<br/>
(Whence Neptune's salt astringent body comes),<br/>
There is a means to separate the twain,<br/>
And thereupon dividedly to see<br/>
How the sweet water, after filtering through<br/>
So often underground, flows freshened forth<br/>
Into some hollow; for it leaves above<br/>
The primal germs of nauseating brine,<br/>
Since cling the rough more readily in earth.<br/>
Lastly, whatso thou markest to disperse<br/>
Upon the instant&mdash;smoke, and cloud, and flame&mdash;<br/>
Must not (even though not all of smooth and round)<br/>
Be yet co-linked with atoms intertwined,<br/>
That thus they can, without together cleaving,<br/>
So pierce our body and so bore the rocks.<br/>
Whatever we see...<br/>
Given to senses, that thou must perceive<br/>
They're not from linked but pointed elements.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The which now having taught, I will go on<br/>
To bind thereto a fact to this allied<br/>
And drawing from this its proof: these primal germs<br/>
Vary, yet only with finite tale of shapes.<br/>
For were these shapes quite infinite, some seeds<br/>
Would have a body of infinite increase.<br/>
For in one seed, in one small frame of any,<br/>
The shapes can't vary from one another much.<br/>
Assume, we'll say, that of three minim parts<br/>
Consist the primal bodies, or add a few:<br/>
When, now, by placing all these parts of one<br/>
At top and bottom, changing lefts and rights,<br/>
Thou hast with every kind of shift found out<br/>
What the aspect of shape of its whole body<br/>
Each new arrangement gives, for what remains,<br/>
If thou percase wouldst vary its old shapes,<br/>
New parts must then be added; follows next,<br/>
If thou percase wouldst vary still its shapes,<br/>
That by like logic each arrangement still<br/>
Requires its increment of other parts.<br/>
Ergo, an augmentation of its frame<br/>
Follows upon each novelty of forms.<br/>
Wherefore, it cannot be thou'lt undertake<br/>
That seeds have infinite differences in form,<br/>
Lest thus thou forcest some indeed to be<br/>
Of an immeasurable immensity&mdash;<br/>
Which I have taught above cannot be proved.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now for thee barbaric robes, and gleam<br/>
Of Meliboean purple, touched with dye<br/>
Of the Thessalian shell...<br/>
The peacock's golden generations, stained<br/>
With spotted gaieties, would lie o'erthrown<br/>
By some new colour of new things more bright;<br/>
The odour of myrrh and savours of honey despised;<br/>
The swan's old lyric, and Apollo's hymns,<br/>
Once modulated on the many chords,<br/>
Would likewise sink o'ermastered and be mute:<br/>
For, lo, a somewhat, finer than the rest,<br/>
Would be arising evermore. So, too,<br/>
Into some baser part might all retire,<br/>
Even as we said to better might they come:<br/>
For, lo, a somewhat, loathlier than the rest<br/>
To nostrils, ears, and eyes, and taste of tongue,<br/>
Would then, by reasoning reversed, be there.<br/>
Since 'tis not so, but unto things are given<br/>
Their fixed limitations which do bound<br/>
Their sum on either side, 'tmust be confessed<br/>
That matter, too, by finite tale of shapes<br/>
Does differ. Again, from earth's midsummer heats<br/>
Unto the icy hoar-frosts of the year<br/>
The forward path is fixed, and by like law<br/>
O'ertravelled backwards at the dawn of spring.<br/>
For each degree of hot, and each of cold,<br/>
And the half-warm, all filling up the sum<br/>
In due progression, lie, my Memmius, there<br/>
Betwixt the two extremes: the things create<br/>
Must differ, therefore, by a finite change,<br/>
Since at each end marked off they ever are<br/>
By fixed point&mdash;on one side plagued by flames<br/>
And on the other by congealing frosts.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The which now having taught, I will go on<br/>
To bind thereto a fact to this allied<br/>
And drawing from this its proof: those primal germs<br/>
Which have been fashioned all of one like shape<br/>
Are infinite in tale; for, since the forms<br/>
Themselves are finite in divergences,<br/>
Then those which are alike will have to be<br/>
Infinite, else the sum of stuff remains<br/>
A finite&mdash;what I've proved is not the fact,<br/>
Showing in verse how corpuscles of stuff,<br/>
From everlasting and to-day the same,<br/>
Uphold the sum of things, all sides around<br/>
By old succession of unending blows.<br/>
For though thou view'st some beasts to be more rare,<br/>
And mark'st in them a less prolific stock,<br/>
Yet in another region, in lands remote,<br/>
That kind abounding may make up the count;<br/>
Even as we mark among the four-foot kind<br/>
Snake-handed elephants, whose thousands wall<br/>
With ivory ramparts India about,<br/>
That her interiors cannot entered be&mdash;<br/>
So big her count of brutes of which we see<br/>
Such few examples. Or suppose, besides,<br/>
We feign some thing, one of its kind and sole<br/>
With body born, to which is nothing like<br/>
In all the lands: yet now unless shall be<br/>
An infinite count of matter out of which<br/>
Thus to conceive and bring it forth to life,<br/>
It cannot be created and&mdash;what's more&mdash;<br/>
It cannot take its food and get increase.<br/>
Yea, if through all the world in finite tale<br/>
Be tossed the procreant bodies of one thing,<br/>
Whence, then, and where in what mode, by what power,<br/>
Shall they to meeting come together there,<br/>
In such vast ocean of matter and tumult strange?&mdash;<br/>
No means they have of joining into one.<br/>
But, just as, after mighty ship-wrecks piled,<br/>
The mighty main is wont to scatter wide<br/>
The rowers' banks, the ribs, the yards, the prow,<br/>
The masts and swimming oars, so that afar<br/>
Along all shores of lands are seen afloat<br/>
The carven fragments of the rended poop,<br/>
Giving a lesson to mortality<br/>
To shun the ambush of the faithless main,<br/>
The violence and the guile, and trust it not<br/>
At any hour, however much may smile<br/>
The crafty enticements of the placid deep:<br/>
Exactly thus, if once thou holdest true<br/>
That certain seeds are finite in their tale,<br/>
The various tides of matter, then, must needs<br/>
Scatter them flung throughout the ages all,<br/>
So that not ever can they join, as driven<br/>
Together into union, nor remain<br/>
In union, nor with increment can grow&mdash;<br/>
But facts in proof are manifest for each:<br/>
Things can be both begotten and increase.<br/>
'Tis therefore manifest that primal germs,<br/>
Are infinite in any class thou wilt&mdash;<br/>
From whence is furnished matter for all things.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor can those motions that bring death prevail<br/>
Forever, nor eternally entomb<br/>
The welfare of the world; nor, further, can<br/>
Those motions that give birth to things and growth<br/>
Keep them forever when created there.<br/>
Thus the long war, from everlasting waged,<br/>
With equal strife among the elements<br/>
Goes on and on. Now here, now there, prevail<br/>
The vital forces of the world&mdash;or fall.<br/>
Mixed with the funeral is the wildered wail<br/>
Of infants coming to the shores of light:<br/>
No night a day, no dawn a night hath followed<br/>
That heard not, mingling with the small birth-cries,<br/>
The wild laments, companions old of death<br/>
And the black rites.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, too, in these affairs<br/>
'Tis fit thou hold well sealed, and keep consigned<br/>
With no forgetting brain: nothing there is<br/>
Whose nature is apparent out of hand<br/>
That of one kind of elements consists&mdash;<br/>
Nothing there is that's not of mixed seed.<br/>
And whatsoe'er possesses in itself<br/>
More largely many powers and properties<br/>
Shows thus that here within itself there are<br/>
The largest number of kinds and differing shapes<br/>
Of elements. And, chief of all, the earth<br/>
Hath in herself first bodies whence the springs,<br/>
Rolling chill waters, renew forevermore<br/>
The unmeasured main; hath whence the fires arise&mdash;<br/>
For burns in many a spot her flamed crust,<br/>
Whilst the impetuous Aetna raves indeed<br/>
From more profounder fires&mdash;and she, again,<br/>
Hath in herself the seed whence she can raise<br/>
The shining grains and gladsome trees for men;<br/>
Whence, also, rivers, fronds, and gladsome pastures<br/>
Can she supply for mountain-roaming beasts.<br/>
Wherefore great mother of gods, and mother of beasts,<br/>
And parent of man hath she alone been named.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Her hymned the old and learned bards of Greece<br/>
Seated in chariot o'er the realms of air<br/>
To drive her team of lions, teaching thus<br/>
That the great earth hangs poised and cannot lie<br/>
Resting on other earth. Unto her car<br/>
They've yoked the wild beasts, since a progeny,<br/>
However savage, must be tamed and chid<br/>
By care of parents. They have girt about<br/>
With turret-crown the summit of her head,<br/>
Since, fortressed in her goodly strongholds high,<br/>
'Tis she sustains the cities; now, adorned<br/>
With that same token, to-day is carried forth,<br/>
With solemn awe through many a mighty land,<br/>
The image of that mother, the divine.<br/>
Her the wide nations, after antique rite,<br/>
Do name Idaean Mother, giving her<br/>
Escort of Phrygian bands, since first, they say,<br/>
From out those regions 'twas that grain began<br/>
Through all the world. To her do they assign<br/>
The Galli, the emasculate, since thus<br/>
They wish to show that men who violate<br/>
The majesty of the mother and have proved<br/>
Ingrate to parents are to be adjudged<br/>
Unfit to give unto the shores of light<br/>
A living progeny. The Galli come:<br/>
And hollow cymbals, tight-skinned tambourines<br/>
Resound around to bangings of their hands;<br/>
The fierce horns threaten with a raucous bray;<br/>
The tubed pipe excites their maddened minds<br/>
In Phrygian measures; they bear before them knives,<br/>
Wild emblems of their frenzy, which have power<br/>
The rabble's ingrate heads and impious hearts<br/>
To panic with terror of the goddess' might.<br/>
And so, when through the mighty cities borne,<br/>
She blesses man with salutations mute,<br/>
They strew the highway of her journeyings<br/>
With coin of brass and silver, gifting her<br/>
With alms and largesse, and shower her and shade<br/>
With flowers of roses falling like the snow<br/>
Upon the Mother and her companion-bands.<br/>
Here is an armed troop, the which by Greeks<br/>
Are called the Phrygian Curetes. Since<br/>
Haply among themselves they use to play<br/>
In games of arms and leap in measure round<br/>
With bloody mirth and by their nodding shake<br/>
The terrorizing crests upon their heads,<br/>
This is the armed troop that represents<br/>
The arm'd Dictaean Curetes, who, in Crete,<br/>
As runs the story, whilom did out-drown<br/>
That infant cry of Zeus, what time their band,<br/>
Young boys, in a swift dance around the boy,<br/>
To measured step beat with the brass on brass,<br/>
That Saturn might not get him for his jaws,<br/>
And give its mother an eternal wound<br/>
Along her heart. And 'tis on this account<br/>
That armed they escort the mighty Mother,<br/>
Or else because they signify by this<br/>
That she, the goddess, teaches men to be<br/>
Eager with armed valour to defend<br/>
Their motherland, and ready to stand forth,<br/>
The guard and glory of their parents' years.<br/>
A tale, however beautifully wrought,<br/>
That's wide of reason by a long remove:<br/>
For all the gods must of themselves enjoy<br/>
Immortal aeons and supreme repose,<br/>
Withdrawn from our affairs, detached, afar:<br/>
Immune from peril and immune from pain,<br/>
Themselves abounding in riches of their own,<br/>
Needing not us, they are not touched by wrath<br/>
They are not taken by service or by gift.<br/>
Truly is earth insensate for all time;<br/>
But, by obtaining germs of many things,<br/>
In many a way she brings the many forth<br/>
Into the light of sun. And here, whoso<br/>
Decides to call the ocean Neptune, or<br/>
The grain-crop Ceres, and prefers to abuse<br/>
The name of Bacchus rather than pronounce<br/>
The liquor's proper designation, him<br/>
Let us permit to go on calling earth<br/>
Mother of Gods, if only he will spare<br/>
To taint his soul with foul religion.<br/>
So, too, the wooly flocks, and horned kine,<br/>
And brood of battle-eager horses, grazing<br/>
Often together along one grassy plain,<br/>
Under the cope of one blue sky, and slaking<br/>
From out one stream of water each its thirst,<br/>
All live their lives with face and form unlike,<br/>
Keeping the parents' nature, parents' habits,<br/>
Which, kind by kind, through ages they repeat.<br/>
So great in any sort of herb thou wilt,<br/>
So great again in any river of earth<br/>
Are the distinct diversities of matter.<br/>
Hence, further, every creature&mdash;any one<br/>
From out them all&mdash;compounded is the same<br/>
Of bones, blood, veins, heat, moisture, flesh, and thews&mdash;<br/>
All differing vastly in their forms, and built<br/>
Of elements dissimilar in shape.<br/>
Again, all things by fire consumed ablaze,<br/>
Within their frame lay up, if naught besides,<br/>
At least those atoms whence derives their power<br/>
To throw forth fire and send out light from under,<br/>
To shoot the sparks and scatter embers wide.<br/>
If, with like reasoning of mind, all else<br/>
Thou traverse through, thou wilt discover thus<br/>
That in their frame the seeds of many things<br/>
They hide, and divers shapes of seeds contain.<br/>
Further, thou markest much, to which are given<br/>
Along together colour and flavour and smell,<br/>
Among which, chief, are most burnt offerings.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus must they be of divers shapes composed.<br/>
A smell of scorching enters in our frame<br/>
Where the bright colour from the dye goes not;<br/>
And colour in one way, flavour in quite another<br/>
Works inward to our senses&mdash;so mayst see<br/>
They differ too in elemental shapes.<br/>
Thus unlike forms into one mass combine,<br/>
And things exist by intermixed seed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But still 'tmust not be thought that in all ways<br/>
All things can be conjoined; for then wouldst view<br/>
Portents begot about thee every side:<br/>
Hulks of mankind half brute astarting up,<br/>
At times big branches sprouting from man's trunk,<br/>
Limbs of a sea-beast to a land-beast knit,<br/>
And nature along the all-producing earth<br/>
Feeding those dire Chimaeras breathing flame<br/>
From hideous jaws&mdash;Of which 'tis simple fact<br/>
That none have been begot; because we see<br/>
All are from fixed seed and fixed dam<br/>
Engendered and so function as to keep<br/>
Throughout their growth their own ancestral type.<br/>
This happens surely by a fixed law:<br/>
For from all food-stuff, when once eaten down,<br/>
Go sundered atoms, suited to each creature,<br/>
Throughout their bodies, and, conjoining there,<br/>
Produce the proper motions; but we see<br/>
How, contrariwise, nature upon the ground<br/>
Throws off those foreign to their frame; and many<br/>
With viewless bodies from their bodies fly,<br/>
By blows impelled&mdash;those impotent to join<br/>
To any part, or, when inside, to accord<br/>
And to take on the vital motions there.<br/>
But think not, haply, living forms alone<br/>
Are bound by these laws: they distinguished all.<br/>
</p>
<p>
For just as all things of creation are,<br/>
In their whole nature, each to each unlike,<br/>
So must their atoms be in shape unlike&mdash;<br/>
Not since few only are fashioned of like form,<br/>
But since they all, as general rule, are not<br/>
The same as all. Nay, here in these our verses,<br/>
Elements many, common to many words,<br/>
Thou seest, though yet 'tis needful to confess<br/>
The words and verses differ, each from each,<br/>
Compounded out of different elements&mdash;<br/>
Not since few only, as common letters, run<br/>
Through all the words, or no two words are made,<br/>
One and the other, from all like elements,<br/>
But since they all, as general rule, are not<br/>
The same as all. Thus, too, in other things,<br/>
Whilst many germs common to many things<br/>
There are, yet they, combined among themselves,<br/>
Can form new wholes to others quite unlike.<br/>
Thus fairly one may say that humankind,<br/>
The grains, the gladsome trees, are all made up<br/>
Of different atoms. Further, since the seeds<br/>
Are different, difference must there also be<br/>
In intervening spaces, thoroughfares,<br/>
Connections, weights, blows, clashings, motions, all<br/>
Which not alone distinguish living forms,<br/>
But sunder earth's whole ocean from the lands,<br/>
And hold all heaven from the lands away.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now come, this wisdom by my sweet toil sought<br/>
Look thou perceive, lest haply thou shouldst guess<br/>
That the white objects shining to thine eyes<br/>
Are gendered of white atoms, or the black<br/>
Of a black seed; or yet believe that aught<br/>
That's steeped in any hue should take its dye<br/>
From bits of matter tinct with hue the same.<br/>
For matter's bodies own no hue the least&mdash;<br/>
Or like to objects or, again, unlike.<br/>
But, if percase it seem to thee that mind<br/>
Itself can dart no influence of its own<br/>
Into these bodies, wide thou wand'rest off.<br/>
For since the blind-born, who have ne'er surveyed<br/>
The light of sun, yet recognise by touch<br/>
Things that from birth had ne'er a hue for them,<br/>
'Tis thine to know that bodies can be brought<br/>
No less unto the ken of our minds too,<br/>
Though yet those bodies with no dye be smeared.<br/>
Again, ourselves whatever in the dark<br/>
We touch, the same we do not find to be<br/>
Tinctured with any colour.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that here<br/>
I win the argument, I next will teach.<br/>
Now, every colour changes, none except,<br/>
And every...<br/>
Which the primordials ought nowise to do.<br/>
Since an immutable somewhat must remain,<br/>
Lest all things utterly be brought to naught.<br/>
For change of anything from out its bounds<br/>
Means instant death of that which was before.<br/>
Wherefore be mindful not to stain with colour<br/>
The seeds of things, lest things return for thee<br/>
All utterly to naught.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, if seeds<br/>
Receive no property of colour, and yet<br/>
Be still endowed with variable forms<br/>
From which all kinds of colours they beget<br/>
And vary (by reason that ever it matters much<br/>
With what seeds, and in what positions joined,<br/>
And what the motions that they give and get),<br/>
Forthwith most easily thou mayst devise<br/>
Why what was black of hue an hour ago<br/>
Can of a sudden like the marble gleam,&mdash;<br/>
As ocean, when the high winds have upheaved<br/>
Its level plains, is changed to hoary waves<br/>
Of marble whiteness: for, thou mayst declare,<br/>
That, when the thing we often see as black<br/>
Is in its matter then commixed anew,<br/>
Some atoms rearranged, and some withdrawn,<br/>
And added some, 'tis seen forthwith to turn<br/>
Glowing and white. But if of azure seeds<br/>
Consist the level waters of the deep,<br/>
They could in nowise whiten: for however<br/>
Thou shakest azure seeds, the same can never<br/>
Pass into marble hue. But, if the seeds&mdash;<br/>
Which thus produce the ocean's one pure sheen&mdash;<br/>
Be now with one hue, now another dyed,<br/>
As oft from alien forms and divers shapes<br/>
A cube's produced all uniform in shape,<br/>
'Twould be but natural, even as in the cube<br/>
We see the forms to be dissimilar,<br/>
That thus we'd see in brightness of the deep<br/>
(Or in whatever one pure sheen thou wilt)<br/>
Colours diverse and all dissimilar.<br/>
Besides, the unlike shapes don't thwart the least<br/>
The whole in being externally a cube;<br/>
But differing hues of things do block and keep<br/>
The whole from being of one resultant hue.<br/>
Then, too, the reason which entices us<br/>
At times to attribute colours to the seeds<br/>
Falls quite to pieces, since white things are not<br/>
Create from white things, nor are black from black,<br/>
But evermore they are create from things<br/>
Of divers colours. Verily, the white<br/>
Will rise more readily, is sooner born<br/>
Out of no colour, than of black or aught<br/>
Which stands in hostile opposition thus.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Besides, since colours cannot be, sans light,<br/>
And the primordials come not forth to light,<br/>
'Tis thine to know they are not clothed with colour&mdash;<br/>
Truly, what kind of colour could there be<br/>
In the viewless dark? Nay, in the light itself<br/>
A colour changes, gleaming variedly,<br/>
When smote by vertical or slanting ray.<br/>
Thus in the sunlight shows the down of doves<br/>
That circles, garlanding, the nape and throat:<br/>
Now it is ruddy with a bright gold-bronze,<br/>
Now, by a strange sensation it becomes<br/>
Green-emerald blended with the coral-red.<br/>
The peacock's tail, filled with the copious light,<br/>
Changes its colours likewise, when it turns.<br/>
Wherefore, since by some blow of light begot,<br/>
Without such blow these colours can't become.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And since the pupil of the eye receives<br/>
Within itself one kind of blow, when said<br/>
To feel a white hue, then another kind,<br/>
When feeling a black or any other hue,<br/>
And since it matters nothing with what hue<br/>
The things thou touchest be perchance endowed,<br/>
But rather with what sort of shape equipped,<br/>
'Tis thine to know the atoms need not colour,<br/>
But render forth sensations, as of touch,<br/>
That vary with their varied forms.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides,<br/>
Since special shapes have not a special colour,<br/>
And all formations of the primal germs<br/>
Can be of any sheen thou wilt, why, then,<br/>
Are not those objects which are of them made<br/>
Suffused, each kind with colours of every kind?<br/>
For then 'twere meet that ravens, as they fly,<br/>
Should dartle from white pinions a white sheen,<br/>
Or swans turn black from seed of black, or be<br/>
Of any single varied dye thou wilt.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Again, the more an object's rent to bits,<br/>
The more thou see its colour fade away<br/>
Little by little till 'tis quite extinct;<br/>
As happens when the gaudy linen's picked<br/>
Shred after shred away: the purple there,<br/>
Phoenician red, most brilliant of all dyes,<br/>
Is lost asunder, ravelled thread by thread;<br/>
Hence canst perceive the fragments die away<br/>
From out their colour, long ere they depart<br/>
Back to the old primordials of things.<br/>
And, last, since thou concedest not all bodies<br/>
Send out a voice or smell, it happens thus<br/>
That not to all thou givest sounds and smells.<br/>
So, too, since we behold not all with eyes,<br/>
'Tis thine to know some things there are as much<br/>
Orphaned of colour, as others without smell,<br/>
And reft of sound; and those the mind alert<br/>
No less can apprehend than it can mark<br/>
The things that lack some other qualities.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But think not haply that the primal bodies<br/>
Remain despoiled alone of colour: so,<br/>
Are they from warmth dissevered and from cold<br/>
And from hot exhalations; and they move,<br/>
Both sterile of sound and dry of juice; and throw<br/>
Not any odour from their proper bodies.<br/>
Just as, when undertaking to prepare<br/>
A liquid balm of myrrh and marjoram,<br/>
And flower of nard, which to our nostrils breathes<br/>
Odour of nectar, first of all behooves<br/>
Thou seek, as far as find thou may and can,<br/>
The inodorous olive-oil (which never sends<br/>
One whiff of scent to nostrils), that it may<br/>
The least debauch and ruin with sharp tang<br/>
The odorous essence with its body mixed<br/>
And in it seethed. And on the same account<br/>
The primal germs of things must not be thought<br/>
To furnish colour in begetting things,<br/>
Nor sound, since pow'rless they to send forth aught<br/>
From out themselves, nor any flavour, too,<br/>
Nor cold, nor exhalation hot or warm.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The rest; yet since these things are mortal all&mdash;<br/>
The pliant mortal, with a body soft;<br/>
The brittle mortal, with a crumbling frame;<br/>
The hollow with a porous-all must be<br/>
Disjoined from the primal elements,<br/>
If still we wish under the world to lay<br/>
Immortal ground-works, whereupon may rest<br/>
The sum of weal and safety, lest for thee<br/>
All things return to nothing utterly.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now, too: whate'er we see possessing sense<br/>
Must yet confessedly be stablished all<br/>
From elements insensate. And those signs,<br/>
So clear to all and witnessed out of hand,<br/>
Do not refute this dictum nor oppose;<br/>
But rather themselves do lead us by the hand,<br/>
Compelling belief that living things are born<br/>
Of elements insensate, as I say.<br/>
Sooth, we may see from out the stinking dung<br/>
Live worms spring up, when, after soaking rains,<br/>
The drenched earth rots; and all things change the same:<br/>
Lo, change the rivers, the fronds, the gladsome pastures<br/>
Into the cattle, the cattle their nature change<br/>
Into our bodies, and from our body, oft<br/>
Grow strong the powers and bodies of wild beasts<br/>
And mighty-winged birds. Thus nature changes<br/>
All foods to living frames, and procreates<br/>
From them the senses of live creatures all,<br/>
In manner about as she uncoils in flames<br/>
Dry logs of wood and turns them all to fire.<br/>
And seest not, therefore, how it matters much<br/>
After what order are set the primal germs,<br/>
And with what other germs they all are mixed,<br/>
And what the motions that they give and get?<br/>
</p>
<p>
But now, what is't that strikes thy sceptic mind,<br/>
Constraining thee to sundry arguments<br/>
Against belief that from insensate germs<br/>
The sensible is gendered?&mdash;Verily,<br/>
'Tis this: that liquids, earth, and wood, though mixed,<br/>
Are yet unable to gender vital sense.<br/>
And, therefore, 'twill be well in these affairs<br/>
This to remember: that I have not said<br/>
Senses are born, under conditions all,<br/>
From all things absolutely which create<br/>
Objects that feel; but much it matters here<br/>
Firstly, how small the seeds which thus compose<br/>
The feeling thing, then, with what shapes endowed,<br/>
And lastly what they in positions be,<br/>
In motions, in arrangements. Of which facts<br/>
Naught we perceive in logs of wood and clods;<br/>
And yet even these, when sodden by the rains,<br/>
Give birth to wormy grubs, because the bodies<br/>
Of matter, from their old arrangements stirred<br/>
By the new factor, then combine anew<br/>
In such a way as genders living things.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Next, they who deem that feeling objects can<br/>
From feeling objects be create, and these,<br/>
In turn, from others that are wont to feel<br/>
When soft they make them; for all sense is linked<br/>
With flesh, and thews, and veins&mdash;and such, we see,<br/>
Are fashioned soft and of a mortal frame.<br/>
Yet be't that these can last forever on:<br/>
They'll have the sense that's proper to a part,<br/>
Or else be judged to have a sense the same<br/>
As that within live creatures as a whole.<br/>
But of themselves those parts can never feel,<br/>
For all the sense in every member back<br/>
To something else refers&mdash;a severed hand,<br/>
Or any other member of our frame,<br/>
Itself alone cannot support sensation.<br/>
It thus remains they must resemble, then,<br/>
Live creatures as a whole, to have the power<br/>
Of feeling sensation concordant in each part<br/>
With the vital sense; and so they're bound to feel<br/>
The things we feel exactly as do we.<br/>
If such the case, how, then, can they be named<br/>
The primal germs of things, and how avoid<br/>
The highways of destruction?&mdash;since they be<br/>
Mere living things and living things be all<br/>
One and the same with mortal. Grant they could,<br/>
Yet by their meetings and their unions all,<br/>
Naught would result, indeed, besides a throng<br/>
And hurly-burly all of living things&mdash;<br/>
Precisely as men, and cattle, and wild beasts,<br/>
By mere conglomeration each with each<br/>
Can still beget not anything of new.<br/>
But if by chance they lose, inside a body,<br/>
Their own sense and another sense take on,<br/>
What, then, avails it to assign them that<br/>
Which is withdrawn thereafter? And besides,<br/>
To touch on proof that we pronounced before,<br/>
Just as we see the eggs of feathered fowls<br/>
To change to living chicks, and swarming worms<br/>
To bubble forth when from the soaking rains<br/>
The earth is sodden, sure, sensations all<br/>
Can out of non-sensations be begot.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But if one say that sense can so far rise<br/>
From non-sense by mutation, or because<br/>
Brought forth as by a certain sort of birth,<br/>
'Twill serve to render plain to him and prove<br/>
There is no birth, unless there be before<br/>
Some formed union of the elements,<br/>
Nor any change, unless they be unite.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In first place, senses can't in body be<br/>
Before its living nature's been begot,&mdash;<br/>
Since all its stuff, in faith, is held dispersed<br/>
About through rivers, air, and earth, and all<br/>
That is from earth created, nor has met<br/>
In combination, and, in proper mode,<br/>
Conjoined into those vital motions which<br/>
Kindle the all-perceiving senses&mdash;they<br/>
That keep and guard each living thing soever.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Again, a blow beyond its nature's strength<br/>
Shatters forthwith each living thing soe'er,<br/>
And on it goes confounding all the sense<br/>
Of body and mind. For of the primal germs<br/>
Are loosed their old arrangements, and, throughout,<br/>
The vital motions blocked,&mdash;until the stuff,<br/>
Shaken profoundly through the frame entire,<br/>
Undoes the vital knots of soul from body<br/>
And throws that soul, to outward wide-dispersed,<br/>
Through all the pores. For what may we surmise<br/>
A blow inflicted can achieve besides<br/>
Shaking asunder and loosening all apart?<br/>
It happens also, when less sharp the blow,<br/>
The vital motions which are left are wont<br/>
Oft to win out&mdash;win out, and stop and still<br/>
The uncouth tumults gendered by the blow,<br/>
And call each part to its own courses back,<br/>
And shake away the motion of death which now<br/>
Begins its own dominion in the body,<br/>
And kindle anew the senses almost gone.<br/>
For by what other means could they the more<br/>
Collect their powers of thought and turn again<br/>
From very doorways of destruction<br/>
Back unto life, rather than pass whereto<br/>
They be already well-nigh sped and so<br/>
Pass quite away?<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, since pain is there<br/>
Where bodies of matter, by some force stirred up,<br/>
Through vitals and through joints, within their seats<br/>
Quiver and quake inside, but soft delight,<br/>
When they remove unto their place again:<br/>
'Tis thine to know the primal germs can be<br/>
Assaulted by no pain, nor from themselves<br/>
Take no delight; because indeed they are<br/>
Not made of any bodies of first things,<br/>
Under whose strange new motions they might ache<br/>
Or pluck the fruit of any dear new sweet.<br/>
And so they must be furnished with no sense.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Once more, if thus, that every living thing<br/>
May have sensation, needful 'tis to assign<br/>
Sense also to its elements, what then<br/>
Of those fixed elements from which mankind<br/>
Hath been, by their peculiar virtue, formed?<br/>
Of verity, they'll laugh aloud, like men,<br/>
Shaken asunder by a spasm of mirth,<br/>
Or sprinkle with dewy tear-drops cheeks and chins,<br/>
And have the cunning hardihood to say<br/>
Much on the composition of the world,<br/>
And in their turn inquire what elements<br/>
They have themselves,&mdash;since, thus the same in kind<br/>
As a whole mortal creature, even they<br/>
Must also be from other elements,<br/>
And then those others from others evermore&mdash;<br/>
So that thou darest nowhere make a stop.<br/>
Oho, I'll follow thee until thou grant<br/>
The seed (which here thou say'st speaks, laughs, and thinks)<br/>
Is yet derived out of other seeds<br/>
Which in their turn are doing just the same.<br/>
But if we see what raving nonsense this,<br/>
And that a man may laugh, though not, forsooth,<br/>
Compounded out of laughing elements,<br/>
And think and utter reason with learn'd speech,<br/>
Though not himself compounded, for a fact,<br/>
Of sapient seeds and eloquent, why, then,<br/>
Cannot those things which we perceive to have<br/>
Their own sensation be composed as well<br/>
Of intermixed seeds quite void of sense?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Once more, we all from seed celestial spring,<br/>
To all is that same father, from whom earth,<br/>
The fostering mother, as she takes the drops<br/>
Of liquid moisture, pregnant bears her broods&mdash;<br/>
The shining grains, and gladsome shrubs and trees,<br/>
And bears the human race and of the wild<br/>
The generations all, the while she yields<br/>
The foods wherewith all feed their frames and lead<br/>
The genial life and propagate their kind;<br/>
Wherefore she owneth that maternal name,<br/>
By old desert. What was before from earth,<br/>
The same in earth sinks back, and what was sent<br/>
From shores of ether, that, returning home,<br/>
The vaults of sky receive. Nor thus doth death<br/>
So far annihilate things that she destroys<br/>
The bodies of matter; but she dissipates<br/>
Their combinations, and conjoins anew<br/>
One element with others; and contrives<br/>
That all things vary forms and change their colours<br/>
And get sensations and straight give them o'er.<br/>
And thus may'st know it matters with what others<br/>
And in what structure the primordial germs<br/>
Are held together, and what motions they<br/>
Among themselves do give and get; nor think<br/>
That aught we see hither and thither afloat<br/>
Upon the crest of things, and now a birth<br/>
And straightway now a ruin, inheres at rest<br/>
Deep in the eternal atoms of the world.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Why, even in these our very verses here<br/>
It matters much with what and in what order<br/>
Each element is set: the same denote<br/>
Sky, and the ocean, lands, and streams, and sun;<br/>
The same, the grains, and trees, and living things.<br/>
And if not all alike, at least the most&mdash;<br/>
But what distinctions by positions wrought!<br/>
And thus no less in things themselves, when once<br/>
Around are changed the intervals between,<br/>
The paths of matter, its connections, weights,<br/>
Blows, clashings, motions, order, structure, shapes,<br/>
The things themselves must likewise changed be.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now to true reason give thy mind for us.<br/>
Since here strange truth is putting forth its might<br/>
To hit thee in thine ears, a new aspect<br/>
Of things to show its front. Yet naught there is<br/>
So easy that it standeth not at first<br/>
More hard to credit than it after is;<br/>
And naught soe'er that's great to such degree,<br/>
Nor wonderful so far, but all mankind<br/>
Little by little abandon their surprise.<br/>
Look upward yonder at the bright clear sky<br/>
And what it holds&mdash;the stars that wander o'er,<br/>
The moon, the radiance of the splendour-sun:<br/>
Yet all, if now they first for mortals were,<br/>
If unforeseen now first asudden shown,<br/>
What might there be more wonderful to tell,<br/>
What that the nations would before have dared<br/>
Less to believe might be?&mdash;I fancy, naught&mdash;<br/>
So strange had been the marvel of that sight.<br/>
The which o'erwearied to behold, to-day<br/>
None deigns look upward to those lucent realms.<br/>
Then, spew not reason from thy mind away,<br/>
Beside thyself because the matter's new,<br/>
But rather with keen judgment nicely weigh;<br/>
And if to thee it then appeareth true,<br/>
Render thy hands, or, if 'tis false at last,<br/>
Gird thee to combat. For my mind-of-man<br/>
Now seeks the nature of the vast Beyond<br/>
There on the other side, that boundless sum<br/>
Which lies without the ramparts of the world,<br/>
Toward which the spirit longs to peer afar,<br/>
Toward which indeed the swift elan of thought<br/>
Flies unencumbered forth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we find,<br/>
Off to all regions round, on either side,<br/>
Above, beneath, throughout the universe<br/>
End is there none&mdash;as I have taught, as too<br/>
The very thing of itself declares aloud,<br/>
And as from nature of the unbottomed deep<br/>
Shines clearly forth. Nor can we once suppose<br/>
In any way 'tis likely, (seeing that space<br/>
To all sides stretches infinite and free,<br/>
And seeds, innumerable in number, in sum<br/>
Bottomless, there in many a manner fly,<br/>
Bestirred in everlasting motion there),<br/>
That only this one earth and sky of ours<br/>
Hath been create and that those bodies of stuff,<br/>
So many, perform no work outside the same;<br/>
Seeing, moreover, this world too hath been<br/>
By nature fashioned, even as seeds of things<br/>
By innate motion chanced to clash and cling&mdash;<br/>
After they'd been in many a manner driven<br/>
Together at random, without design, in vain&mdash;<br/>
And as at last those seeds together dwelt,<br/>
Which, when together of a sudden thrown,<br/>
Should alway furnish the commencements fit<br/>
Of mighty things&mdash;the earth, the sea, the sky,<br/>
And race of living creatures. Thus, I say,<br/>
Again, again, 'tmust be confessed there are<br/>
Such congregations of matter otherwhere,<br/>
Like this our world which vasty ether holds<br/>
In huge embrace.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, when matter abundant<br/>
Is ready there, when space on hand, nor object<br/>
Nor any cause retards, no marvel 'tis<br/>
That things are carried on and made complete,<br/>
Perforce. And now, if store of seeds there is<br/>
So great that not whole life-times of the living<br/>
Can count the tale...<br/>
And if their force and nature abide the same,<br/>
Able to throw the seeds of things together<br/>
Into their places, even as here are thrown<br/>
The seeds together in this world of ours,<br/>
'Tmust be confessed in other realms there are<br/>
Still other worlds, still other breeds of men,<br/>
And other generations of the wild.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Hence too it happens in the sum there is<br/>
No one thing single of its kind in birth,<br/>
And single and sole in growth, but rather it is<br/>
One member of some generated race,<br/>
Among full many others of like kind.<br/>
First, cast thy mind abroad upon the living:<br/>
Thou'lt find the race of mountain-ranging wild<br/>
Even thus to be, and thus the scions of men<br/>
To be begot, and lastly the mute flocks<br/>
Of scaled fish, and winged frames of birds.<br/>
Wherefore confess we must on grounds the same<br/>
That earth, sun, moon, and ocean, and all else,<br/>
Exist not sole and single&mdash;rather in number<br/>
Exceeding number. Since that deeply set<br/>
Old boundary stone of life remains for them<br/>
No less, and theirs a body of mortal birth<br/>
No less, than every kind which here on earth<br/>
Is so abundant in its members found.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Which well perceived if thou hold in mind,<br/>
Then Nature, delivered from every haughty lord,<br/>
And forthwith free, is seen to do all things<br/>
Herself and through herself of own accord,<br/>
Rid of all gods. For&mdash;by their holy hearts<br/>
Which pass in long tranquillity of peace<br/>
Untroubled ages and a serene life!&mdash;<br/>
Who hath the power (I ask), who hath the power<br/>
To rule the sum of the immeasurable,<br/>
To hold with steady hand the giant reins<br/>
Of the unfathomed deep? Who hath the power<br/>
At once to roll a multitude of skies,<br/>
At once to heat with fires ethereal all<br/>
The fruitful lands of multitudes of worlds,<br/>
To be at all times in all places near,<br/>
To stablish darkness by his clouds, to shake<br/>
The serene spaces of the sky with sound,<br/>
And hurl his lightnings,&mdash;ha, and whelm how oft<br/>
In ruins his own temples, and to rave,<br/>
Retiring to the wildernesses, there<br/>
At practice with that thunderbolt of his,<br/>
Which yet how often shoots the guilty by,<br/>
And slays the honourable blameless ones!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Ere since the birth-time of the world, ere since<br/>
The risen first-born day of sea, earth, sun,<br/>
Have many germs been added from outside,<br/>
Have many seeds been added round about,<br/>
Which the great All, the while it flung them on,<br/>
Brought hither, that from them the sea and lands<br/>
Could grow more big, and that the house of heaven<br/>
Might get more room and raise its lofty roofs<br/>
Far over earth, and air arise around.<br/>
For bodies all, from out all regions, are<br/>
Divided by blows, each to its proper thing,<br/>
And all retire to their own proper kinds:<br/>
The moist to moist retires; earth gets increase<br/>
From earthy body; and fires, as on a forge,<br/>
Beat out new fire; and ether forges ether;<br/>
Till nature, author and ender of the world,<br/>
Hath led all things to extreme bound of growth:<br/>
As haps when that which hath been poured inside<br/>
The vital veins of life is now no more<br/>
Than that which ebbs within them and runs off.<br/>
This is the point where life for each thing ends;<br/>
This is the point where nature with her powers<br/>
Curbs all increase. For whatsoe'er thou seest<br/>
Grow big with glad increase, and step by step<br/>
Climb upward to ripe age, these to themselves<br/>
Take in more bodies than they send from selves,<br/>
Whilst still the food is easily infused<br/>
Through all the veins, and whilst the things are not<br/>
So far expanded that they cast away<br/>
Such numerous atoms as to cause a waste<br/>
Greater than nutriment whereby they wax.<br/>
For 'tmust be granted, truly, that from things<br/>
Many a body ebbeth and runs off;<br/>
But yet still more must come, until the things<br/>
Have touched development's top pinnacle;<br/>
Then old age breaks their powers and ripe strength<br/>
And falls away into a worser part.<br/>
For ever the ampler and more wide a thing,<br/>
As soon as ever its augmentation ends,<br/>
It scatters abroad forthwith to all sides round<br/>
More bodies, sending them from out itself.<br/>
Nor easily now is food disseminate<br/>
Through all its veins; nor is that food enough<br/>
To equal with a new supply on hand<br/>
Those plenteous exhalations it gives off.<br/>
Thus, fairly, all things perish, when with ebbing<br/>
They're made less dense and when from blows without<br/>
They are laid low; since food at last will fail<br/>
Extremest eld, and bodies from outside<br/>
Cease not with thumping to undo a thing<br/>
And overmaster by infesting blows.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus, too, the ramparts of the mighty world<br/>
On all sides round shall taken be by storm,<br/>
And tumble to wrack and shivered fragments down.<br/>
For food it is must keep things whole, renewing;<br/>
'Tis food must prop and give support to all,&mdash;<br/>
But to no purpose, since nor veins suffice<br/>
To hold enough, nor nature ministers<br/>
As much as needful. And even now 'tis thus:<br/>
Its age is broken and the earth, outworn<br/>
With many parturitions, scarce creates<br/>
The little lives&mdash;she who created erst<br/>
All generations and gave forth at birth<br/>
Enormous bodies of wild beasts of old.<br/>
For never, I fancy, did a golden cord<br/>
From off the firmament above let down<br/>
The mortal generations to the fields;<br/>
Nor sea, nor breakers pounding on the rocks<br/>
Created them; but earth it was who bore&mdash;<br/>
The same to-day who feeds them from herself.<br/>
Besides, herself of own accord, she first<br/>
The shining grains and vineyards of all joy<br/>
Created for mortality; herself<br/>
Gave the sweet fruitage and the pastures glad,<br/>
Which now to-day yet scarcely wax in size,<br/>
Even when aided by our toiling arms.<br/>
We break the ox, and wear away the strength<br/>
Of sturdy farm-hands; iron tools to-day<br/>
Barely avail for tilling of the fields,<br/>
So niggardly they grudge our harvestings,<br/>
So much increase our labour. Now to-day<br/>
The aged ploughman, shaking of his head,<br/>
Sighs o'er and o'er that labours of his hands<br/>
Have fallen out in vain, and, as he thinks<br/>
How present times are not as times of old,<br/>
Often he praises the fortunes of his sire,<br/>
And crackles, prating, how the ancient race,<br/>
Fulfilled with piety, supported life<br/>
With simple comfort in a narrow plot,<br/>
Since, man for man, the measure of each field<br/>
Was smaller far i' the old days. And, again,<br/>
The gloomy planter of the withered vine<br/>
Rails at the season's change and wearies heaven,<br/>
Nor grasps that all of things by sure degrees<br/>
Are wasting away and going to the tomb,<br/>
Outworn by venerable length of life.<br/>

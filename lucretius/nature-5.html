<h1>The Nature of Things</h1>
<h2>by Lucretius</h2>
<h3>Book V</h3>
<p>
O who can build with puissant breast a song<br/>
Worthy the majesty of these great finds?<br/>
Or who in words so strong that he can frame<br/>
The fit laudations for deserts of him<br/>
Who left us heritors of such vast prizes,<br/>
By his own breast discovered and sought out?&mdash;<br/>
There shall be none, methinks, of mortal stock.<br/>
For if must needs be named for him the name<br/>
Demanded by the now known majesty<br/>
Of these high matters, then a god was he,&mdash;<br/>
Hear me, illustrious Memmius&mdash;a god;<br/>
Who first and chief found out that plan of life<br/>
Which now is called philosophy, and who<br/>
By cunning craft, out of such mighty waves,<br/>
Out of such mighty darkness, moored life<br/>
In havens so serene, in light so clear.<br/>
Compare those old discoveries divine<br/>
Of others: lo, according to the tale,<br/>
Ceres established for mortality<br/>
The grain, and Bacchus juice of vine-born grape,<br/>
Though life might yet without these things abide,<br/>
Even as report saith now some peoples live.<br/>
But man's well-being was impossible<br/>
Without a breast all free. Wherefore the more<br/>
That man doth justly seem to us a god,<br/>
From whom sweet solaces of life, afar<br/>
Distributed o'er populous domains,<br/>
Now soothe the minds of men. But if thou thinkest<br/>
Labours of Hercules excel the same,<br/>
Much farther from true reasoning thou farest.<br/>
For what could hurt us now that mighty maw<br/>
Of Nemeaean Lion, or what the Boar<br/>
Who bristled in Arcadia? Or, again,<br/>
O what could Cretan Bull, or Hydra, pest<br/>
Of Lerna, fenced with vipers venomous?<br/>
Or what the triple-breasted power of her<br/>
The three-fold Geryon...<br/>
The sojourners in the Stymphalian fens<br/>
So dreadfully offend us, or the Steeds<br/>
Of Thracian Diomedes breathing fire<br/>
From out their nostrils off along the zones<br/>
Bistonian and Ismarian? And the Snake,<br/>
The dread fierce gazer, guardian of the golden<br/>
And gleaming apples of the Hesperides,<br/>
Coiled round the tree-trunk with tremendous bulk,<br/>
O what, again, could he inflict on us<br/>
Along the Atlantic shore and wastes of sea?&mdash;<br/>
Where neither one of us approacheth nigh<br/>
Nor no barbarian ventures. And the rest<br/>
Of all those monsters slain, even if alive,<br/>
Unconquered still, what injury could they do?<br/>
None, as I guess. For so the glutted earth<br/>
Swarms even now with savage beasts, even now<br/>
Is filled with anxious terrors through the woods<br/>
And mighty mountains and the forest deeps&mdash;<br/>
Quarters 'tis ours in general to avoid.<br/>
But lest the breast be purged, what conflicts then,<br/>
What perils, must bosom, in our own despite!<br/>
O then how great and keen the cares of lust<br/>
That split the man distraught! How great the fears!<br/>
And lo, the pride, grim greed, and wantonness&mdash;<br/>
How great the slaughters in their train! and lo,<br/>
Debaucheries and every breed of sloth!<br/>
Therefore that man who subjugated these,<br/>
And from the mind expelled, by words indeed,<br/>
Not arms, O shall it not be seemly him<br/>
To dignify by ranking with the gods?&mdash;<br/>
And all the more since he was wont to give,<br/>
Concerning the immortal gods themselves,<br/>
Many pronouncements with a tongue divine,<br/>
And to unfold by his pronouncements all<br/>
The nature of the world.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And walking now<br/>
In his own footprints, I do follow through<br/>
His reasonings, and with pronouncements teach<br/>
The covenant whereby all things are framed,<br/>
How under that covenant they must abide<br/>
Nor ever prevail to abrogate the aeons'<br/>
Inexorable decrees,&mdash;how (as we've found),<br/>
In class of mortal objects, o'er all else,<br/>
The mind exists of earth-born frame create<br/>
And impotent unscathed to abide<br/>
Across the mighty aeons, and how come<br/>
In sleep those idol-apparitions,<br/>
That so befool intelligence when we<br/>
Do seem to view a man whom life has left.<br/>
Thus far we've gone; the order of my plan<br/>
Hath brought me now unto the point where I<br/>
Must make report how, too, the universe<br/>
Consists of mortal body, born in time,<br/>
And in what modes that congregated stuff<br/>
Established itself as earth and sky,<br/>
Ocean, and stars, and sun, and ball of moon;<br/>
And then what living creatures rose from out<br/>
The old telluric places, and what ones<br/>
Were never born at all; and in what mode<br/>
The human race began to name its things<br/>
And use the varied speech from man to man;<br/>
And in what modes hath bosomed in their breasts<br/>
That awe of gods, which halloweth in all lands<br/>
Fanes, altars, groves, lakes, idols of the gods.<br/>
Also I shall untangle by what power<br/>
The steersman nature guides the sun's courses,<br/>
And the meanderings of the moon, lest we,<br/>
Percase, should fancy that of own free will<br/>
They circle their perennial courses round,<br/>
Timing their motions for increase of crops<br/>
And living creatures, or lest we should think<br/>
They roll along by any plan of gods.<br/>
For even those men who have learned full well<br/>
That godheads lead a long life free of care,<br/>
If yet meanwhile they wonder by what plan<br/>
Things can go on (and chiefly yon high things<br/>
Observed o'erhead on the ethereal coasts),<br/>
Again are hurried back unto the fears<br/>
Of old religion and adopt again<br/>
Harsh masters, deemed almighty,&mdash;wretched men,<br/>
Unwitting what can be and what cannot,<br/>
And by what law to each its scope prescribed,<br/>
Its boundary stone that clings so deep in Time.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But for the rest,&mdash;lest we delay thee here<br/>
Longer by empty promises&mdash;behold,<br/>
Before all else, the seas, the lands, the sky:<br/>
O Memmius, their threefold nature, lo,<br/>
Their bodies three, three aspects so unlike,<br/>
Three frames so vast, a single day shall give<br/>
Unto annihilation! Then shall crash<br/>
That massive form and fabric of the world<br/>
Sustained so many aeons! Nor do I<br/>
Fail to perceive how strange and marvellous<br/>
This fact must strike the intellect of man,&mdash;<br/>
Annihilation of the sky and earth<br/>
That is to be,&mdash;and with what toil of words<br/>
'Tis mine to prove the same; as happens oft<br/>
When once ye offer to man's listening ears<br/>
Something before unheard of, but may not<br/>
Subject it to the view of eyes for him<br/>
Nor put it into hand&mdash;the sight and touch,<br/>
Whereby the opened highways of belief<br/>
Lead most directly into human breast<br/>
And regions of intelligence. But yet<br/>
I will speak out. The fact itself, perchance,<br/>
Will force belief in these my words, and thou<br/>
Mayst see, in little time, tremendously<br/>
With risen commotions of the lands all things<br/>
Quaking to pieces&mdash;which afar from us<br/>
May she, the steersman Nature, guide: and may<br/>
Reason, O rather than the fact itself,<br/>
Persuade us that all things can be o'erthrown<br/>
And sink with awful-sounding breakage down!<br/>
</p>
<p>
But ere on this I take a step to utter<br/>
Oracles holier and soundlier based<br/>
Than ever the Pythian pronounced for men<br/>
From out the tripod and the Delphian laurel,<br/>
I will unfold for thee with learned words<br/>
Many a consolation, lest perchance,<br/>
Still bridled by religion, thou suppose<br/>
Lands, sun, and sky, sea, constellations, moon,<br/>
Must dure forever, as of frame divine&mdash;<br/>
And so conclude that it is just that those,<br/>
(After the manner of the Giants), should all<br/>
Pay the huge penalties for monstrous crime,<br/>
Who by their reasonings do overshake<br/>
The ramparts of the universe and wish<br/>
There to put out the splendid sun of heaven,<br/>
Branding with mortal talk immortal things&mdash;<br/>
Though these same things are even so far removed<br/>
From any touch of deity and seem<br/>
So far unworthy of numbering with the gods,<br/>
That well they may be thought to furnish rather<br/>
A goodly instance of the sort of things<br/>
That lack the living motion, living sense.<br/>
For sure 'tis quite beside the mark to think<br/>
That judgment and the nature of the mind<br/>
In any kind of body can exist&mdash;<br/>
Just as in ether can't exist a tree,<br/>
Nor clouds in the salt sea, nor in the fields<br/>
Can fishes live, nor blood in timber be,<br/>
Nor sap in boulders: fixed and arranged<br/>
Where everything may grow and have its place.<br/>
Thus nature of mind cannot arise alone<br/>
Without the body, nor have its being far<br/>
From thews and blood. Yet if 'twere possible?&mdash;<br/>
Much rather might this very power of mind<br/>
Be in the head, the shoulders, or the heels,<br/>
And, born in any part soever, yet<br/>
In the same man, in the same vessel abide<br/>
But since within this body even of ours<br/>
Stands fixed and appears arranged sure<br/>
Where soul and mind can each exist and grow,<br/>
Deny we must the more that they can dure<br/>
Outside the body and the breathing form<br/>
In rotting clods of earth, in the sun's fire,<br/>
In water, or in ether's skiey coasts.<br/>
Therefore these things no whit are furnished<br/>
With sense divine, since never can they be<br/>
With life-force quickened.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, thou canst ne'er<br/>
Believe the sacred seats of gods are here<br/>
In any regions of this mundane world;<br/>
Indeed, the nature of the gods, so subtle,<br/>
So far removed from these our senses, scarce<br/>
Is seen even by intelligence of mind.<br/>
And since they've ever eluded touch and thrust<br/>
Of human hands, they cannot reach to grasp<br/>
Aught tangible to us. For what may not<br/>
Itself be touched in turn can never touch.<br/>
Wherefore, besides, also their seats must be<br/>
Unlike these seats of ours,&mdash;even subtle too,<br/>
As meet for subtle essence&mdash;as I'll prove<br/>
Hereafter unto thee with large discourse.<br/>
Further, to say that for the sake of men<br/>
They willed to prepare this world's magnificence,<br/>
And that 'tis therefore duty and behoof<br/>
To praise the work of gods as worthy praise,<br/>
And that 'tis sacrilege for men to shake<br/>
Ever by any force from out their seats<br/>
What hath been stablished by the Forethought old<br/>
To everlasting for races of mankind,<br/>
And that 'tis sacrilege to assault by words<br/>
And overtopple all from base to beam,&mdash;<br/>
Memmius, such notions to concoct and pile,<br/>
Is verily&mdash;to dote. Our gratefulness,<br/>
O what emoluments could it confer<br/>
Upon Immortals and upon the Blessed<br/>
That they should take a step to manage aught<br/>
For sake of us? Or what new factor could,<br/>
After so long a time, inveigle them&mdash;<br/>
The hitherto reposeful&mdash;to desire<br/>
To change their former life? For rather he<br/>
Whom old things chafe seems likely to rejoice<br/>
At new; but one that in fore-passed time<br/>
Hath chanced upon no ill, through goodly years,<br/>
O what could ever enkindle in such an one<br/>
Passion for strange experiment? Or what<br/>
The evil for us, if we had ne'er been born?&mdash;<br/>
As though, forsooth, in darkling realms and woe<br/>
Our life were lying till should dawn at last<br/>
The day-spring of creation! Whosoever<br/>
Hath been begotten wills perforce to stay<br/>
In life, so long as fond delight detains;<br/>
But whoso ne'er hath tasted love of life,<br/>
And ne'er was in the count of living things,<br/>
What hurts it him that he was never born?<br/>
Whence, further, first was planted in the gods<br/>
The archetype for gendering the world<br/>
And the fore-notion of what man is like,<br/>
So that they knew and pre-conceived with mind<br/>
Just what they wished to make? Or how were known<br/>
Ever the energies of primal germs,<br/>
And what those germs, by interchange of place,<br/>
Could thus produce, if nature's self had not<br/>
Given example for creating all?<br/>
For in such wise primordials of things,<br/>
Many in many modes, astir by blows<br/>
From immemorial aeons, in motion too<br/>
By their own weights, have evermore been wont<br/>
To be so borne along and in all modes<br/>
To meet together and to try all sorts<br/>
Which, by combining one with other, they<br/>
Are powerful to create, that thus it is<br/>
No marvel now, if they have also fallen<br/>
Into arrangements such, and if they've passed<br/>
Into vibrations such, as those whereby<br/>
This sum of things is carried on to-day<br/>
By fixed renewal. But knew I never what<br/>
The seeds primordial were, yet would I dare<br/>
This to affirm, even from deep judgments based<br/>
Upon the ways and conduct of the skies&mdash;<br/>
This to maintain by many a fact besides&mdash;<br/>
That in no wise the nature of all things<br/>
For us was fashioned by a power divine&mdash;<br/>
So great the faults it stands encumbered with.<br/>
First, mark all regions which are overarched<br/>
By the prodigious reaches of the sky:<br/>
One yawning part thereof the mountain-chains<br/>
And forests of the beasts do have and hold;<br/>
And cliffs, and desert fens, and wastes of sea<br/>
(Which sunder afar the beaches of the lands)<br/>
Possess it merely; and, again, thereof<br/>
Well-nigh two-thirds intolerable heat<br/>
And a perpetual fall of frost doth rob<br/>
From mortal kind. And what is left to till,<br/>
Even that the force of nature would o'errun<br/>
With brambles, did not human force oppose,&mdash;<br/>
Long wont for livelihood to groan and sweat<br/>
Over the two-pronged mattock and to cleave<br/>
The soil in twain by pressing on the plough.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Unless, by the ploughshare turning the fruitful clods<br/>
And kneading the mould, we quicken into birth,<br/>
[The crops] spontaneously could not come up<br/>
Into the free bright air. Even then sometimes,<br/>
When things acquired by the sternest toil<br/>
Are now in leaf, are now in blossom all,<br/>
Either the skiey sun with baneful heats<br/>
Parches, or sudden rains or chilling rime<br/>
Destroys, or flaws of winds with furious whirl<br/>
Torment and twist. Beside these matters, why<br/>
Doth nature feed and foster on land and sea<br/>
The dreadful breed of savage beasts, the foes<br/>
Of the human clan? Why do the seasons bring<br/>
Distempers with them? Wherefore stalks at large<br/>
Death, so untimely? Then, again, the babe,<br/>
Like to the castaway of the raging surf,<br/>
Lies naked on the ground, speechless, in want<br/>
Of every help for life, when nature first<br/>
Hath poured him forth upon the shores of light<br/>
With birth-pangs from within the mother's womb,<br/>
And with a plaintive wail he fills the place,&mdash;<br/>
As well befitting one for whom remains<br/>
In life a journey through so many ills.<br/>
But all the flocks and herds and all wild beasts<br/>
Come forth and grow, nor need the little rattles,<br/>
Nor must be treated to the humouring nurse's<br/>
Dear, broken chatter; nor seek they divers clothes<br/>
To suit the changing skies; nor need, in fine,<br/>
Nor arms, nor lofty ramparts, wherewithal<br/>
Their own to guard&mdash;because the earth herself<br/>
And nature, artificer of the world, bring forth<br/>
Aboundingly all things for all.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And first,<br/>
Since body of earth and water, air's light breath,<br/>
And fiery exhalations (of which four<br/>
This sum of things is seen to be compact)<br/>
So all have birth and perishable frame,<br/>
Thus the whole nature of the world itself<br/>
Must be conceived as perishable too.<br/>
For, verily, those things of which we see<br/>
The parts and members to have birth in time<br/>
And perishable shapes, those same we mark<br/>
To be invariably born in time<br/>
And born to die. And therefore when I see<br/>
The mightiest members and the parts of this<br/>
Our world consumed and begot again,<br/>
'Tis mine to know that also sky above<br/>
And earth beneath began of old in time<br/>
And shall in time go under to disaster.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And lest in these affairs thou deemest me<br/>
To have seized upon this point by sleight to serve<br/>
My own caprice&mdash;because I have assumed<br/>
That earth and fire are mortal things indeed,<br/>
And have not doubted water and the air<br/>
Both perish too and have affirmed the same<br/>
To be again begotten and wax big&mdash;<br/>
Mark well the argument: in first place, lo,<br/>
Some certain parts of earth, grievously parched<br/>
By unremitting suns, and trampled on<br/>
By a vast throng of feet, exhale abroad<br/>
A powdery haze and flying clouds of dust,<br/>
Which the stout winds disperse in the whole air.<br/>
A part, moreover, of her sod and soil<br/>
Is summoned to inundation by the rains;<br/>
And rivers graze and gouge the banks away.<br/>
Besides, whatever takes a part its own<br/>
In fostering and increasing [aught]...<br/>
</p>
<p>
Is rendered back; and since, beyond a doubt,<br/>
Earth, the all-mother, is beheld to be<br/>
Likewise the common sepulchre of things,<br/>
Therefore thou seest her minished of her plenty,<br/>
And then again augmented with new growth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And for the rest, that sea, and streams, and springs<br/>
Forever with new waters overflow,<br/>
And that perennially the fluids well,<br/>
Needeth no words&mdash;the mighty flux itself<br/>
Of multitudinous waters round about<br/>
Declareth this. But whatso water first<br/>
Streams up is ever straightway carried off,<br/>
And thus it comes to pass that all in all<br/>
There is no overflow; in part because<br/>
The burly winds (that over-sweep amain)<br/>
And skiey sun (that with his rays dissolves)<br/>
Do minish the level seas; in part because<br/>
The water is diffused underground<br/>
Through all the lands. The brine is filtered off,<br/>
And then the liquid stuff seeps back again<br/>
And all regathers at the river-heads,<br/>
Whence in fresh-water currents on it flows<br/>
Over the lands, adown the channels which<br/>
Were cleft erstwhile and erstwhile bore along<br/>
The liquid-footed floods.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, then, of air<br/>
I'll speak, which hour by hour in all its body<br/>
Is changed innumerably. For whatso'er<br/>
Streams up in dust or vapour off of things,<br/>
The same is all and always borne along<br/>
Into the mighty ocean of the air;<br/>
And did not air in turn restore to things<br/>
Bodies, and thus recruit them as they stream,<br/>
All things by this time had resolved been<br/>
And changed into air. Therefore it never<br/>
Ceases to be engendered off of things<br/>
And to return to things, since verily<br/>
In constant flux do all things stream.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise,<br/>
The abounding well-spring of the liquid light,<br/>
The ethereal sun, doth flood the heaven o'er<br/>
With constant flux of radiance ever new,<br/>
And with fresh light supplies the place of light,<br/>
Upon the instant. For whatever effulgence<br/>
Hath first streamed off, no matter where it falls,<br/>
Is lost unto the sun. And this 'tis thine<br/>
To know from these examples: soon as clouds<br/>
Have first begun to under-pass the sun,<br/>
And, as it were, to rend the rays of light<br/>
In twain, at once the lower part of them<br/>
Is lost entire, and earth is overcast<br/>
Where'er the thunderheads are rolled along&mdash;<br/>
So know thou mayst that things forever need<br/>
A fresh replenishment of gleam and glow,<br/>
And each effulgence, foremost flashed forth,<br/>
Perisheth one by one. Nor otherwise<br/>
Can things be seen in sunlight, lest alway<br/>
The fountain-head of light supply new light.<br/>
Indeed your earthly beacons of the night,<br/>
The hanging lampions and the torches, bright<br/>
With darting gleams and dense with livid soot,<br/>
Do hurry in like manner to supply<br/>
With ministering heat new light amain;<br/>
Are all alive to quiver with their fires,&mdash;<br/>
Are so alive, that thus the light ne'er leaves<br/>
The spots it shines on, as if rent in twain:<br/>
So speedily is its destruction veiled<br/>
By the swift birth of flame from all the fires.<br/>
Thus, then, we must suppose that sun and moon<br/>
And stars dart forth their light from under-births<br/>
Ever and ever new, and whatso flames<br/>
First rise do perish always one by one&mdash;<br/>
Lest, haply, thou shouldst think they each endure<br/>
Inviolable.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, perceivest not<br/>
How stones are also conquered by Time?&mdash;<br/>
Not how the lofty towers ruin down,<br/>
And boulders crumble?&mdash;Not how shrines of gods<br/>
And idols crack outworn?&mdash;Nor how indeed<br/>
The holy Influence hath yet no power<br/>
There to postpone the Terminals of Fate,<br/>
Or headway make 'gainst Nature's fixed decrees?<br/>
Again, behold we not the monuments<br/>
Of heroes, now in ruins, asking us,<br/>
In their turn likewise, if we don't believe<br/>
They also age with eld? Behold we not<br/>
The rended basalt ruining amain<br/>
Down from the lofty mountains, powerless<br/>
To dure and dree the mighty forces there<br/>
Of finite time?&mdash;for they would never fall<br/>
Rended asudden, if from infinite Past<br/>
They had prevailed against all engin'ries<br/>
Of the assaulting aeons, with no crash.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Again, now look at This, which round, above,<br/>
Contains the whole earth in its one embrace:<br/>
If from itself it procreates all things&mdash;<br/>
As some men tell&mdash;and takes them to itself<br/>
When once destroyed, entirely must it be<br/>
Of mortal birth and body; for whate'er<br/>
From out itself giveth to other things<br/>
Increase and food, the same perforce must be<br/>
Minished, and then recruited when it takes<br/>
Things back into itself.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides all this,<br/>
If there had been no origin-in-birth<br/>
Of lands and sky, and they had ever been<br/>
The everlasting, why, ere Theban war<br/>
And obsequies of Troy, have other bards<br/>
Not also chanted other high affairs?<br/>
Whither have sunk so oft so many deeds<br/>
Of heroes? Why do those deeds live no more,<br/>
Ingrafted in eternal monuments<br/>
Of glory? Verily, I guess, because<br/>
The Sum is new, and of a recent date<br/>
The nature of our universe, and had<br/>
Not long ago its own exordium.<br/>
Wherefore, even now some arts are being still<br/>
Refined, still increased: now unto ships<br/>
Is being added many a new device;<br/>
And but the other day musician-folk<br/>
Gave birth to melic sounds of organing;<br/>
And, then, this nature, this account of things<br/>
Hath been discovered latterly, and I<br/>
Myself have been discovered only now,<br/>
As first among the first, able to turn<br/>
The same into ancestral Roman speech.<br/>
Yet if, percase, thou deemest that ere this<br/>
Existed all things even the same, but that<br/>
Perished the cycles of the human race<br/>
In fiery exhalations, or cities fell<br/>
By some tremendous quaking of the world,<br/>
Or rivers in fury, after constant rains,<br/>
Had plunged forth across the lands of earth<br/>
And whelmed the towns&mdash;then, all the more must thou<br/>
Confess, defeated by the argument,<br/>
That there shall be annihilation too<br/>
Of lands and sky. For at a time when things<br/>
Were being taxed by maladies so great,<br/>
And so great perils, if some cause more fell<br/>
Had then assailed them, far and wide they would<br/>
Have gone to disaster and supreme collapse.<br/>
And by no other reasoning are we<br/>
Seen to be mortal, save that all of us<br/>
Sicken in turn with those same maladies<br/>
With which have sickened in the past those men<br/>
Whom nature hath removed from life.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Whatever abides eternal must indeed<br/>
Either repel all strokes, because 'tis made<br/>
Of solid body, and permit no entrance<br/>
Of aught with power to sunder from within<br/>
The parts compact&mdash;as are those seeds of stuff<br/>
Whose nature we've exhibited before;<br/>
Or else be able to endure through time<br/>
For this: because they are from blows exempt,<br/>
As is the void, the which abides untouched,<br/>
Unsmit by any stroke; or else because<br/>
There is no room around, whereto things can,<br/>
As 'twere, depart in dissolution all,&mdash;<br/>
Even as the sum of sums eternal is,<br/>
Without or place beyond whereto things may<br/>
Asunder fly, or bodies which can smite,<br/>
And thus dissolve them by the blows of might.<br/>
But not of solid body, as I've shown,<br/>
Exists the nature of the world, because<br/>
In things is intermingled there a void;<br/>
Nor is the world yet as the void, nor are,<br/>
Moreover, bodies lacking which, percase,<br/>
Rising from out the infinite, can fell<br/>
With fury-whirlwinds all this sum of things,<br/>
Or bring upon them other cataclysm<br/>
Of peril strange; and yonder, too, abides<br/>
The infinite space and the profound abyss&mdash;<br/>
Whereinto, lo, the ramparts of the world<br/>
Can yet be shivered. Or some other power<br/>
Can pound upon them till they perish all.<br/>
Thus is the door of doom, O nowise barred<br/>
Against the sky, against the sun and earth<br/>
And deep-sea waters, but wide open stands<br/>
And gloats upon them, monstrous and agape.<br/>
Wherefore, again, 'tis needful to confess<br/>
That these same things are born in time; for things<br/>
Which are of mortal body could indeed<br/>
Never from infinite past until to-day<br/>
Have spurned the multitudinous assaults<br/>
Of the immeasurable aeons old.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Again, since battle so fiercely one with other<br/>
The four most mighty members the world,<br/>
Aroused in an all unholy war,<br/>
Seest not that there may be for them an end<br/>
Of the long strife?&mdash;Or when the skiey sun<br/>
And all the heat have won dominion o'er<br/>
The sucked-up waters all?&mdash;And this they try<br/>
Still to accomplish, though as yet they fail,&mdash;<br/>
For so aboundingly the streams supply<br/>
New store of waters that 'tis rather they<br/>
Who menace the world with inundations vast<br/>
From forth the unplumbed chasms of the sea.<br/>
But vain&mdash;since winds (that over-sweep amain)<br/>
And skiey sun (that with his rays dissolves)<br/>
Do minish the level seas and trust their power<br/>
To dry up all, before the waters can<br/>
Arrive at the end of their endeavouring.<br/>
Breathing such vasty warfare, they contend<br/>
In balanced strife the one with other still<br/>
Concerning mighty issues,&mdash;though indeed<br/>
The fire was once the more victorious,<br/>
And once&mdash;as goes the tale&mdash;the water won<br/>
A kingdom in the fields. For fire o'ermastered<br/>
And licked up many things and burnt away,<br/>
What time the impetuous horses of the Sun<br/>
Snatched Phaethon headlong from his skiey road<br/>
Down the whole ether and over all the lands.<br/>
But the omnipotent Father in keen wrath<br/>
Then with the sudden smite of thunderbolt<br/>
Did hurl the mighty-minded hero off<br/>
Those horses to the earth. And Sol, his sire,<br/>
Meeting him as he fell, caught up in hand<br/>
The ever-blazing lampion of the world,<br/>
And drave together the pell-mell horses there<br/>
And yoked them all a-tremble, and amain,<br/>
Steering them over along their own old road,<br/>
Restored the cosmos,&mdash;as forsooth we hear<br/>
From songs of ancient poets of the Greeks&mdash;<br/>
A tale too far away from truth, meseems.<br/>
For fire can win when from the infinite<br/>
Has risen a larger throng of particles<br/>
Of fiery stuff; and then its powers succumb,<br/>
Somehow subdued again, or else at last<br/>
It shrivels in torrid atmospheres the world.<br/>
And whilom water too began to win&mdash;<br/>
As goes the story&mdash;when it overwhelmed<br/>
The lives of men with billows; and thereafter,<br/>
When all that force of water-stuff which forth<br/>
From out the infinite had risen up<br/>
Did now retire, as somehow turned aside,<br/>
The rain-storms stopped, and streams their fury checked.<br/>
FORMATION OF THE WORLD AND<br/>
ASTRONOMICAL QUESTIONS<br/>
But in what modes that conflux of first-stuff<br/>
Did found the multitudinous universe<br/>
Of earth, and sky, and the unfathomed deeps<br/>
Of ocean, and courses of the sun and moon,<br/>
I'll now in order tell. For of a truth<br/>
Neither by counsel did the primal germs<br/>
'Stablish themselves, as by keen act of mind,<br/>
Each in its proper place; nor did they make,<br/>
Forsooth, a compact how each germ should move;<br/>
But, lo, because primordials of things,<br/>
Many in many modes, astir by blows<br/>
From immemorial aeons, in motion too<br/>
By their own weights, have evermore been wont<br/>
To be so borne along and in all modes<br/>
To meet together and to try all sorts<br/>
Which, by combining one with other, they<br/>
Are powerful to create: because of this<br/>
It comes to pass that those primordials,<br/>
Diffused far and wide through mighty aeons,<br/>
The while they unions try, and motions too,<br/>
Of every kind, meet at the last amain,<br/>
And so become oft the commencements fit<br/>
Of mighty things&mdash;earth, sea, and sky, and race<br/>
Of living creatures.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that long-ago<br/>
The wheel of the sun could nowhere be discerned<br/>
Flying far up with its abounding blaze,<br/>
Nor constellations of the mighty world,<br/>
Nor ocean, nor heaven, nor even earth nor air.<br/>
Nor aught of things like unto things of ours<br/>
Could then be seen&mdash;but only some strange storm<br/>
And a prodigious hurly-burly mass<br/>
Compounded of all kinds of primal germs,<br/>
Whose battling discords in disorder kept<br/>
Interstices, and paths, coherencies,<br/>
And weights, and blows, encounterings, and motions,<br/>
Because, by reason of their forms unlike<br/>
And varied shapes, they could not all thuswise<br/>
Remain conjoined nor harmoniously<br/>
Have interplay of movements. But from there<br/>
Portions began to fly asunder, and like<br/>
With like to join, and to block out a world,<br/>
And to divide its members and dispose<br/>
Its mightier parts&mdash;that is, to set secure<br/>
The lofty heavens from the lands, and cause<br/>
The sea to spread with waters separate,<br/>
And fires of ether separate and pure<br/>
Likewise to congregate apart.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, lo,<br/>
First came together the earthy particles<br/>
(As being heavy and intertangled) there<br/>
In the mid-region, and all began to take<br/>
The lowest abodes; and ever the more they got<br/>
One with another intertangled, the more<br/>
They pressed from out their mass those particles<br/>
Which were to form the sea, the stars, the sun,<br/>
And moon, and ramparts of the mighty world&mdash;<br/>
For these consist of seeds more smooth and round<br/>
And of much smaller elements than earth.<br/>
And thus it was that ether, fraught with fire,<br/>
First broke away from out the earthen parts,<br/>
Athrough the innumerable pores of earth,<br/>
And raised itself aloft, and with itself<br/>
Bore lightly off the many starry fires;<br/>
And not far otherwise we often see<br/>
</p>
<p>
And the still lakes and the perennial streams<br/>
Exhale a mist, and even as earth herself<br/>
Is seen at times to smoke, when first at dawn<br/>
The light of the sun, the many-rayed, begins<br/>
To redden into gold, over the grass<br/>
Begemmed with dew. When all of these are brought<br/>
Together overhead, the clouds on high<br/>
With now concreted body weave a cover<br/>
Beneath the heavens. And thuswise ether too,<br/>
Light and diffusive, with concreted body<br/>
On all sides spread, on all sides bent itself<br/>
Into a dome, and, far and wide diffused<br/>
On unto every region on all sides,<br/>
Thus hedged all else within its greedy clasp.<br/>
Hard upon ether came the origins<br/>
Of sun and moon, whose globes revolve in air<br/>
Midway between the earth and mightiest ether,&mdash;<br/>
For neither took them, since they weighed too little<br/>
To sink and settle, but too much to glide<br/>
Along the upmost shores; and yet they are<br/>
In such a wise midway between the twain<br/>
As ever to whirl their living bodies round,<br/>
And ever to dure as parts of the wide Whole;<br/>
In the same fashion as certain members may<br/>
In us remain at rest, whilst others move.<br/>
When, then, these substances had been withdrawn,<br/>
Amain the earth, where now extend the vast<br/>
Cerulean zones of all the level seas,<br/>
Caved in, and down along the hollows poured<br/>
The whirlpools of her brine; and day by day<br/>
The more the tides of ether and rays of sun<br/>
On every side constrained into one mass<br/>
The earth by lashing it again, again,<br/>
Upon its outer edges (so that then,<br/>
Being thus beat upon, 'twas all condensed<br/>
About its proper centre), ever the more<br/>
The salty sweat, from out its body squeezed,<br/>
Augmented ocean and the fields of foam<br/>
By seeping through its frame, and all the more<br/>
Those many particles of heat and air<br/>
Escaping, began to fly aloft, and form,<br/>
By condensation there afar from earth,<br/>
The high refulgent circuits of the heavens.<br/>
The plains began to sink, and windy slopes<br/>
Of the high mountains to increase; for rocks<br/>
Could not subside, nor all the parts of ground<br/>
Settle alike to one same level there.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus, then, the massy weight of earth stood firm<br/>
With now concreted body, when (as 'twere)<br/>
All of the slime of the world, heavy and gross,<br/>
Had run together and settled at the bottom,<br/>
Like lees or bilge. Then ocean, then the air,<br/>
Then ether herself, the fraught-with-fire, were all<br/>
Left with their liquid bodies pure and free,<br/>
And each more lighter than the next below;<br/>
And ether, most light and liquid of the three,<br/>
Floats on above the long aerial winds,<br/>
Nor with the brawling of the winds of air<br/>
Mingles its liquid body. It doth leave<br/>
All there&mdash;those under-realms below her heights&mdash;<br/>
There to be overset in whirlwinds wild,&mdash;<br/>
Doth leave all there to brawl in wayward gusts,<br/>
Whilst, gliding with a fixed impulse still,<br/>
Itself it bears its fires along. For, lo,<br/>
That ether can flow thus steadily on, on,<br/>
With one unaltered urge, the Pontus proves&mdash;<br/>
That sea which floweth forth with fixed tides,<br/>
Keeping one onward tenor as it glides.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And that the earth may there abide at rest<br/>
In the mid-region of the world, it needs<br/>
Must vanish bit by bit in weight and lessen,<br/>
And have another substance underneath,<br/>
Conjoined to it from its earliest age<br/>
In linked unison with the vasty world's<br/>
Realms of the air in which it roots and lives.<br/>
On this account, the earth is not a load,<br/>
Nor presses down on winds of air beneath;<br/>
Even as unto a man his members be<br/>
Without all weight&mdash;the head is not a load<br/>
Unto the neck; nor do we feel the whole<br/>
Weight of the body to centre in the feet.<br/>
But whatso weights come on us from without,<br/>
Weights laid upon us, these harass and chafe,<br/>
Though often far lighter. For to such degree<br/>
It matters always what the innate powers<br/>
Of any given thing may be. The earth<br/>
Was, then, no alien substance fetched amain,<br/>
And from no alien firmament cast down<br/>
On alien air; but was conceived, like air,<br/>
In the first origin of this the world,<br/>
As a fixed portion of the same, as now<br/>
Our members are seen to be a part of us.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Besides, the earth, when of a sudden shook<br/>
By the big thunder, doth with her motion shake<br/>
All that's above her&mdash;which she ne'er could do<br/>
By any means, were earth not bounden fast<br/>
Unto the great world's realms of air and sky:<br/>
For they cohere together with common roots,<br/>
Conjoined both, even from their earliest age,<br/>
In linked unison. Aye, seest thou not<br/>
That this most subtle energy of soul<br/>
Supports our body, though so heavy a weight,&mdash;<br/>
Because, indeed, 'tis with it so conjoined<br/>
In linked unison? What power, in sum,<br/>
Can raise with agile leap our body aloft,<br/>
Save energy of mind which steers the limbs?<br/>
Now seest thou not how powerful may be<br/>
A subtle nature, when conjoined it is<br/>
With heavy body, as air is with the earth<br/>
Conjoined, and energy of mind with us?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now let us sing what makes the stars to move.<br/>
In first place, if the mighty sphere of heaven<br/>
Revolveth round, then needs we must aver<br/>
That on the upper and the under pole<br/>
Presses a certain air, and from without<br/>
Confines them and encloseth at each end;<br/>
And that, moreover, another air above<br/>
Streams on athwart the top of the sphere and tends<br/>
In same direction as are rolled along<br/>
The glittering stars of the eternal world;<br/>
Or that another still streams on below<br/>
To whirl the sphere from under up and on<br/>
In opposite direction&mdash;as we see<br/>
The rivers turn the wheels and water-scoops.<br/>
It may be also that the heavens do all<br/>
Remain at rest, whilst yet are borne along<br/>
The lucid constellations; either because<br/>
Swift tides of ether are by sky enclosed,<br/>
And whirl around, seeking a passage out,<br/>
And everywhere make roll the starry fires<br/>
Through the Summanian regions of the sky;<br/>
Or else because some air, streaming along<br/>
From an eternal quarter off beyond,<br/>
Whileth the driven fires, or, then, because<br/>
The fires themselves have power to creep along,<br/>
Going wherever their food invites and calls,<br/>
And feeding their flaming bodies everywhere<br/>
Throughout the sky. Yet which of these is cause<br/>
In this our world 'tis hard to say for sure;<br/>
But what can be throughout the universe,<br/>
In divers worlds on divers plan create,<br/>
This only do I show, and follow on<br/>
To assign unto the motions of the stars<br/>
Even several causes which 'tis possible<br/>
Exist throughout the universal All;<br/>
Of which yet one must be the cause even here<br/>
Which maketh motion for our constellations.<br/>
Yet to decide which one of them it be<br/>
Is not the least the business of a man<br/>
Advancing step by cautious step, as I.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor can the sun's wheel larger be by much<br/>
Nor its own blaze much less than either seems<br/>
Unto our senses. For from whatso spaces<br/>
Fires have the power on us to cast their beams<br/>
And blow their scorching exhalations forth<br/>
Against our members, those same distances<br/>
Take nothing by those intervals away<br/>
From bulk of flames; and to the sight the fire<br/>
Is nothing shrunken. Therefore, since the heat<br/>
And the outpoured light of skiey sun<br/>
Arrive our senses and caress our limbs,<br/>
Form too and bigness of the sun must look<br/>
Even here from earth just as they really be,<br/>
So that thou canst scarce nothing take or add.<br/>
And whether the journeying moon illuminate<br/>
The regions round with bastard beams, or throw<br/>
From off her proper body her own light,&mdash;<br/>
Whichever it be, she journeys with a form<br/>
Naught larger than the form doth seem to be<br/>
Which we with eyes of ours perceive. For all<br/>
The far removed objects of our gaze<br/>
Seem through much air confused in their look<br/>
Ere minished in their bigness. Wherefore, moon,<br/>
Since she presents bright look and clear-cut form,<br/>
May there on high by us on earth be seen<br/>
Just as she is with extreme bounds defined,<br/>
And just of the size. And lastly, whatso fires<br/>
Of ether thou from earth beholdest, these<br/>
Thou mayst consider as possibly of size<br/>
The least bit less, or larger by a hair<br/>
Than they appear&mdash;since whatso fires we view<br/>
Here in the lands of earth are seen to change<br/>
From time to time their size to less or more<br/>
Only the least, when more or less away,<br/>
So long as still they bicker clear, and still<br/>
Their glow's perceived.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor need there be for men<br/>
Astonishment that yonder sun so small<br/>
Can yet send forth so great a light as fills<br/>
Oceans and all the lands and sky aflood,<br/>
And with its fiery exhalations steeps<br/>
The world at large. For it may be, indeed,<br/>
That one vast-flowing well-spring of the whole<br/>
Wide world from here hath opened and out-gushed,<br/>
And shot its light abroad; because thuswise<br/>
The elements of fiery exhalations<br/>
From all the world around together come,<br/>
And thuswise flow into a bulk so big<br/>
That from one single fountain-head may stream<br/>
This heat and light. And seest thou not, indeed,<br/>
How widely one small water-spring may wet<br/>
The meadow-lands at times and flood the fields?<br/>
'Tis even possible, besides, that heat<br/>
From forth the sun's own fire, albeit that fire<br/>
Be not a great, may permeate the air<br/>
With the fierce hot&mdash;if but, perchance, the air<br/>
Be of condition and so tempered then<br/>
As to be kindled, even when beat upon<br/>
Only by little particles of heat&mdash;<br/>
Just as we sometimes see the standing grain<br/>
Or stubble straw in conflagration all<br/>
From one lone spark. And possibly the sun,<br/>
Agleam on high with rosy lampion,<br/>
Possesses about him with invisible heats<br/>
A plenteous fire, by no effulgence marked,<br/>
So that he maketh, he, the Fraught-with-fire,<br/>
Increase to such degree the force of rays.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Nor is there one sure cause revealed to men<br/>
How the sun journeys from his summer haunts<br/>
On to the mid-most winter turning-points<br/>
In Capricorn, the thence reverting veers<br/>
Back to solstitial goals of Cancer; nor<br/>
How 'tis the moon is seen each month to cross<br/>
That very distance which in traversing<br/>
The sun consumes the measure of a year.<br/>
I say, no one clear reason hath been given<br/>
For these affairs. Yet chief in likelihood<br/>
Seemeth the doctrine which the holy thought<br/>
Of great Democritus lays down: that ever<br/>
The nearer the constellations be to earth<br/>
The less can they by whirling of the sky<br/>
Be borne along, because those skiey powers<br/>
Of speed aloft do vanish and decrease<br/>
In under-regions, and the sun is thus<br/>
Left by degrees behind amongst those signs<br/>
That follow after, since the sun he lies<br/>
Far down below the starry signs that blaze;<br/>
And the moon lags even tardier than the sun:<br/>
In just so far as is her course removed<br/>
From upper heaven and nigh unto the lands,<br/>
In just so far she fails to keep the pace<br/>
With starry signs above; for just so far<br/>
As feebler is the whirl that bears her on,<br/>
(Being, indeed, still lower than the sun),<br/>
In just so far do all the starry signs,<br/>
Circling around, o'ertake her and o'erpass.<br/>
Therefore it happens that the moon appears<br/>
More swiftly to return to any sign<br/>
Along the Zodiac, than doth the sun,<br/>
Because those signs do visit her again<br/>
More swiftly than they visit the great sun.<br/>
It can be also that two streams of air<br/>
Alternately at fixed periods<br/>
Blow out from transverse regions of the world,<br/>
Of which the one may thrust the sun away<br/>
From summer-signs to mid-most winter goals<br/>
And rigors of the cold, and the other then<br/>
May cast him back from icy shades of chill<br/>
Even to the heat-fraught regions and the signs<br/>
That blaze along the Zodiac. So, too,<br/>
We must suppose the moon and all the stars,<br/>
Which through the mighty and sidereal years<br/>
Roll round in mighty orbits, may be sped<br/>
By streams of air from regions alternate.<br/>
Seest thou not also how the clouds be sped<br/>
By contrary winds to regions contrary,<br/>
The lower clouds diversely from the upper?<br/>
Then, why may yonder stars in ether there<br/>
Along their mighty orbits not be borne<br/>
By currents opposite the one to other?<br/>
</p>
<p>
But night o'erwhelms the lands with vasty murk<br/>
Either when sun, after his diurnal course,<br/>
Hath walked the ultimate regions of the sky<br/>
And wearily hath panted forth his fires,<br/>
Shivered by their long journeying and wasted<br/>
By traversing the multitudinous air,<br/>
Or else because the self-same force that drave<br/>
His orb along above the lands compels<br/>
Him then to turn his course beneath the lands.<br/>
Matuta also at a fixed hour<br/>
Spreadeth the roseate morning out along<br/>
The coasts of heaven and deploys the light,<br/>
Either because the self-same sun, returning<br/>
Under the lands, aspires to seize the sky,<br/>
Striving to set it blazing with his rays<br/>
Ere he himself appear, or else because<br/>
Fires then will congregate and many seeds<br/>
Of heat are wont, even at a fixed time,<br/>
To stream together&mdash;gendering evermore<br/>
New suns and light. Just so the story goes<br/>
That from the Idaean mountain-tops are seen<br/>
Dispersed fires upon the break of day<br/>
Which thence combine, as 'twere, into one ball<br/>
And form an orb. Nor yet in these affairs<br/>
Is aught for wonder that these seeds of fire<br/>
Can thus together stream at time so fixed<br/>
And shape anew the splendour of the sun.<br/>
For many facts we see which come to pass<br/>
At fixed time in all things: burgeon shrubs<br/>
At fixed time, and at a fixed time<br/>
They cast their flowers; and Eld commands the teeth,<br/>
At time as surely fixed, to drop away,<br/>
And Youth commands the growing boy to bloom<br/>
With the soft down and let from both his cheeks<br/>
The soft beard fall. And lastly, thunder-bolts,<br/>
Snow, rains, clouds, winds, at seasons of the year<br/>
Nowise unfixed, all do come to pass.<br/>
For where, even from their old primordial start<br/>
Causes have ever worked in such a way,<br/>
And where, even from the world's first origin,<br/>
Thuswise have things befallen, so even now<br/>
After a fixed order they come round<br/>
In sequence also.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, days may wax<br/>
Whilst the nights wane, and daylight minished be<br/>
Whilst nights do take their augmentations,<br/>
Either because the self-same sun, coursing<br/>
Under the lands and over in two arcs,<br/>
A longer and a briefer, doth dispart<br/>
The coasts of ether and divides in twain<br/>
His orbit all unequally, and adds,<br/>
As round he's borne, unto the one half there<br/>
As much as from the other half he's ta'en,<br/>
Until he then arrives that sign of heaven<br/>
Where the year's node renders the shades of night<br/>
Equal unto the periods of light.<br/>
For when the sun is midway on his course<br/>
Between the blasts of northwind and of south,<br/>
Heaven keeps his two goals parted equally,<br/>
By virtue of the fixed position old<br/>
Of the whole starry Zodiac, through which<br/>
That sun, in winding onward, takes a year,<br/>
Illumining the sky and all the lands<br/>
With oblique light&mdash;as men declare to us<br/>
Who by their diagrams have charted well<br/>
Those regions of the sky which be adorned<br/>
With the arranged signs of Zodiac.<br/>
Or else, because in certain parts the air<br/>
Under the lands is denser, the tremulous<br/>
Bright beams of fire do waver tardily,<br/>
Nor easily can penetrate that air<br/>
Nor yet emerge unto their rising-place:<br/>
For this it is that nights in winter time<br/>
Do linger long, ere comes the many-rayed<br/>
Round Badge of the day. Or else because, as said,<br/>
In alternating seasons of the year<br/>
Fires, now more quick, and now more slow, are wont<br/>
To stream together,&mdash;the fires which make the sun<br/>
To rise in some one spot&mdash;therefore it is<br/>
That those men seem to speak the truth [who hold<br/>
A new sun is with each new daybreak born].<br/>
</p>
<p>
The moon she possibly doth shine because<br/>
Strook by the rays of sun, and day by day<br/>
May turn unto our gaze her light, the more<br/>
She doth recede from orb of sun, until,<br/>
Facing him opposite across the world,<br/>
She hath with full effulgence gleamed abroad,<br/>
And, at her rising as she soars above,<br/>
Hath there observed his setting; thence likewise<br/>
She needs must hide, as 'twere, her light behind<br/>
By slow degrees, the nearer now she glides,<br/>
Along the circle of the Zodiac,<br/>
From her far place toward fires of yonder sun,&mdash;<br/>
As those men hold who feign the moon to be<br/>
Just like a ball and to pursue a course<br/>
Betwixt the sun and earth. There is, again,<br/>
Some reason to suppose that moon may roll<br/>
With light her very own, and thus display<br/>
The varied shapes of her resplendence there.<br/>
For near her is, percase, another body,<br/>
Invisible, because devoid of light,<br/>
Borne on and gliding all along with her,<br/>
Which in three modes may block and blot her disk.<br/>
Again, she may revolve upon herself,<br/>
Like to a ball's sphere&mdash;if perchance that be&mdash;<br/>
One half of her dyed o'er with glowing light,<br/>
And by the revolution of that sphere<br/>
She may beget for us her varying shapes,<br/>
Until she turns that fiery part of her<br/>
Full to the sight and open eyes of men;<br/>
Thence by slow stages round and back she whirls,<br/>
Withdrawing thus the luminiferous part<br/>
Of her sphered mass and ball, as, verily,<br/>
The Babylonian doctrine of Chaldees,<br/>
Refuting the art of Greek astrologers,<br/>
Labours, in opposition, to prove sure&mdash;<br/>
As if, forsooth, the thing for which each fights,<br/>
Might not alike be true,&mdash;or aught there were<br/>
Wherefore thou mightest risk embracing one<br/>
More than the other notion. Then, again,<br/>
Why a new moon might not forevermore<br/>
Created be with fixed successions there<br/>
Of shapes and with configurations fixed,<br/>
And why each day that bright created moon<br/>
Might not miscarry and another be,<br/>
In its stead and place, engendered anew,<br/>
'Tis hard to show by reason, or by words<br/>
To prove absurd&mdash;since, lo, so many things<br/>
Can be create with fixed successions:<br/>
Spring-time and Venus come, and Venus' boy,<br/>
The winged harbinger, steps on before,<br/>
And hard on Zephyr's foot-prints Mother Flora,<br/>
Sprinkling the ways before them, filleth all<br/>
With colours and with odours excellent;<br/>
Whereafter follows arid Heat, and he<br/>
Companioned is by Ceres, dusty one,<br/>
And by the Etesian Breezes of the north;<br/>
Then cometh Autumn on, and with him steps<br/>
Lord Bacchus, and then other Seasons too<br/>
And other Winds do follow&mdash;the high roar<br/>
Of great Volturnus, and the Southwind strong<br/>
With thunder-bolts. At last earth's Shortest-Day<br/>
Bears on to men the snows and brings again<br/>
The numbing cold. And Winter follows her,<br/>
His teeth with chills a-chatter. Therefore, 'tis<br/>
The less a marvel, if at fixed time<br/>
A moon is thus begotten and again<br/>
At fixed time destroyed, since things so many<br/>
Can come to being thus at fixed time.<br/>
Likewise, the sun's eclipses and the moon's<br/>
Far occultations rightly thou mayst deem<br/>
</p>
<p>
As due to several causes. For, indeed,<br/>
Why should the moon be able to shut out<br/>
Earth from the light of sun, and on the side<br/>
To earthward thrust her high head under sun,<br/>
Opposing dark orb to his glowing beams&mdash;<br/>
And yet, at same time, one suppose the effect<br/>
Could not result from some one other body<br/>
Which glides devoid of light forevermore?<br/>
Again, why could not sun, in weakened state,<br/>
At fixed time for-lose his fires, and then,<br/>
When he has passed on along the air<br/>
Beyond the regions, hostile to his flames,<br/>
That quench and kill his fires, why could not he<br/>
Renew his light? And why should earth in turn<br/>
Have power to rob the moon of light, and there,<br/>
Herself on high, keep the sun hid beneath,<br/>
Whilst the moon glideth in her monthly course<br/>
Athrough the rigid shadows of the cone?&mdash;<br/>
And yet, at same time, some one other body<br/>
Not have the power to under-pass the moon,<br/>
Or glide along above the orb of sun,<br/>
Breaking his rays and outspread light asunder?<br/>
And still, if moon herself refulgent be<br/>
With her own sheen, why could she not at times<br/>
In some one quarter of the mighty world<br/>
Grow weak and weary, whilst she passeth through<br/>
Regions unfriendly to the beams her own?<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now to what remains!&mdash;Since I've resolved<br/>
By what arrangements all things come to pass<br/>
Through the blue regions of the mighty world,&mdash;<br/>
How we can know what energy and cause<br/>
Started the various courses of the sun<br/>
And the moon's goings, and by what far means<br/>
They can succumb, the while with thwarted light,<br/>
And veil with shade the unsuspecting lands,<br/>
When, as it were, they blink, and then again<br/>
With open eye survey all regions wide,<br/>
Resplendent with white radiance&mdash;I do now<br/>
Return unto the world's primeval age<br/>
And tell what first the soft young fields of earth<br/>
With earliest parturition had decreed<br/>
To raise in air unto the shores of light<br/>
And to entrust unto the wayward winds.<br/>
In the beginning, earth gave forth, around<br/>
The hills and over all the length of plains,<br/>
The race of grasses and the shining green;<br/>
The flowery meadows sparkled all aglow<br/>
With greening colour, and thereafter, lo,<br/>
Unto the divers kinds of trees was given<br/>
An emulous impulse mightily to shoot,<br/>
With a free rein, aloft into the air.<br/>
As feathers and hairs and bristles are begot<br/>
The first on members of the four-foot breeds<br/>
And on the bodies of the strong-y-winged,<br/>
Thus then the new Earth first of all put forth<br/>
Grasses and shrubs, and afterward begat<br/>
The mortal generations, there upsprung&mdash;<br/>
Innumerable in modes innumerable&mdash;<br/>
After diverging fashions. For from sky<br/>
These breathing-creatures never can have dropped,<br/>
Nor the land-dwellers ever have come up<br/>
Out of sea-pools of salt. How true remains,<br/>
How merited is that adopted name<br/>
Of earth&mdash;"The Mother!"&mdash;since from out the earth<br/>
Are all begotten. And even now arise<br/>
From out the loams how many living things&mdash;<br/>
Concreted by the rains and heat of the sun.<br/>
Wherefore 'tis less a marvel, if they sprang<br/>
In Long Ago more many, and more big,<br/>
Matured of those days in the fresh young years<br/>
Of earth and ether. First of all, the race<br/>
Of the winged ones and parti-coloured birds,<br/>
Hatched out in spring-time, left their eggs behind;<br/>
As now-a-days in summer tree-crickets<br/>
Do leave their shiny husks of own accord,<br/>
Seeking their food and living. Then it was<br/>
This earth of thine first gave unto the day<br/>
The mortal generations; for prevailed<br/>
Among the fields abounding hot and wet.<br/>
And hence, where any fitting spot was given,<br/>
There 'gan to grow womb-cavities, by roots<br/>
Affixed to earth. And when in ripened time<br/>
The age of the young within (that sought the air<br/>
And fled earth's damps) had burst these wombs, O then<br/>
Would Nature thither turn the pores of earth<br/>
And make her spurt from open veins a juice<br/>
Like unto milk; even as a woman now<br/>
Is filled, at child-bearing, with the sweet milk,<br/>
Because all that swift stream of aliment<br/>
Is thither turned unto the mother-breasts.<br/>
There earth would furnish to the children food;<br/>
Warmth was their swaddling cloth, the grass their bed<br/>
Abounding in soft down. Earth's newness then<br/>
Would rouse no dour spells of the bitter cold,<br/>
Nor extreme heats nor winds of mighty powers&mdash;<br/>
For all things grow and gather strength through time<br/>
In like proportions; and then earth was young.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Wherefore, again, again, how merited<br/>
Is that adopted name of Earth&mdash;The Mother!&mdash;<br/>
Since she herself begat the human race,<br/>
And at one well-nigh fixed time brought forth<br/>
Each breast that ranges raving round about<br/>
Upon the mighty mountains and all birds<br/>
Aerial with many a varied shape.<br/>
But, lo, because her bearing years must end,<br/>
She ceased, like to a woman worn by eld.<br/>
For lapsing aeons change the nature of<br/>
The whole wide world, and all things needs must take<br/>
One status after other, nor aught persists<br/>
Forever like itself. All things depart;<br/>
Nature she changeth all, compelleth all<br/>
To transformation. Lo, this moulders down,<br/>
A-slack with weary eld, and that, again,<br/>
Prospers in glory, issuing from contempt.<br/>
In suchwise, then, the lapsing aeons change<br/>
The nature of the whole wide world, and earth<br/>
Taketh one status after other. And what<br/>
She bore of old, she now can bear no longer,<br/>
And what she never bore, she can to-day.<br/>
</p>
<p>
In those days also the telluric world<br/>
Strove to beget the monsters that upsprung<br/>
With their astounding visages and limbs&mdash;<br/>
The Man-woman&mdash;a thing betwixt the twain,<br/>
Yet neither, and from either sex remote&mdash;<br/>
Some gruesome Boggles orphaned of the feet,<br/>
Some widowed of the hands, dumb Horrors too<br/>
Without a mouth, or blind Ones of no eye,<br/>
Or Bulks all shackled by their legs and arms<br/>
Cleaving unto the body fore and aft,<br/>
Thuswise, that never could they do or go,<br/>
Nor shun disaster, nor take the good they would.<br/>
And other prodigies and monsters earth<br/>
Was then begetting of this sort&mdash;in vain,<br/>
Since Nature banned with horror their increase,<br/>
And powerless were they to reach unto<br/>
The coveted flower of fair maturity,<br/>
Or to find aliment, or to intertwine<br/>
In works of Venus. For we see there must<br/>
Concur in life conditions manifold,<br/>
If life is ever by begetting life<br/>
To forge the generations one by one:<br/>
First, foods must be; and, next, a path whereby<br/>
The seeds of impregnation in the frame<br/>
May ooze, released from the members all;<br/>
Last, the possession of those instruments<br/>
Whereby the male with female can unite,<br/>
The one with other in mutual ravishments.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And in the ages after monsters died,<br/>
Perforce there perished many a stock, unable<br/>
By propagation to forge a progeny.<br/>
For whatsoever creatures thou beholdest<br/>
Breathing the breath of life, the same have been<br/>
Even from their earliest age preserved alive<br/>
By cunning, or by valour, or at least<br/>
By speed of foot or wing. And many a stock<br/>
Remaineth yet, because of use to man,<br/>
And so committed to man's guardianship.<br/>
Valour hath saved alive fierce lion-breeds<br/>
And many another terrorizing race,<br/>
Cunning the foxes, flight the antlered stags.<br/>
Light-sleeping dogs with faithful heart in breast,<br/>
However, and every kind begot from seed<br/>
Of beasts of draft, as, too, the woolly flocks<br/>
And horned cattle, all, my Memmius,<br/>
Have been committed to guardianship of men.<br/>
For anxiously they fled the savage beasts,<br/>
And peace they sought and their abundant foods,<br/>
Obtained with never labours of their own,<br/>
Which we secure to them as fit rewards<br/>
For their good service. But those beasts to whom<br/>
Nature has granted naught of these same things&mdash;<br/>
Beasts quite unfit by own free will to thrive<br/>
And vain for any service unto us<br/>
In thanks for which we should permit their kind<br/>
To feed and be in our protection safe&mdash;<br/>
Those, of a truth, were wont to be exposed,<br/>
Enshackled in the gruesome bonds of doom,<br/>
As prey and booty for the rest, until<br/>
Nature reduced that stock to utter death.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But Centaurs ne'er have been, nor can there be<br/>
Creatures of twofold stock and double frame,<br/>
Compact of members alien in kind,<br/>
Yet formed with equal function, equal force<br/>
In every bodily part&mdash;a fact thou mayst,<br/>
However dull thy wits, well learn from this:<br/>
The horse, when his three years have rolled away,<br/>
Flowers in his prime of vigour; but the boy<br/>
Not so, for oft even then he gropes in sleep<br/>
After the milky nipples of the breasts,<br/>
An infant still. And later, when at last<br/>
The lusty powers of horses and stout limbs,<br/>
Now weak through lapsing life, do fail with age,<br/>
Lo, only then doth youth with flowering years<br/>
Begin for boys, and clothe their ruddy cheeks<br/>
With the soft down. So never deem, percase,<br/>
That from a man and from the seed of horse,<br/>
The beast of draft, can Centaurs be composed<br/>
Or e'er exist alive, nor Scyllas be&mdash;<br/>
The half-fish bodies girdled with mad dogs&mdash;<br/>
Nor others of this sort, in whom we mark<br/>
Members discordant each with each; for ne'er<br/>
At one same time they reach their flower of age<br/>
Or gain and lose full vigour of their frame,<br/>
And never burn with one same lust of love,<br/>
And never in their habits they agree,<br/>
Nor find the same foods equally delightsome&mdash;<br/>
Sooth, as one oft may see the bearded goats<br/>
Batten upon the hemlock which to man<br/>
Is violent poison. Once again, since flame<br/>
Is wont to scorch and burn the tawny bulks<br/>
Of the great lions as much as other kinds<br/>
Of flesh and blood existing in the lands,<br/>
How could it be that she, Chimaera lone,<br/>
With triple body&mdash;fore, a lion she;<br/>
And aft, a dragon; and betwixt, a goat&mdash;<br/>
Might at the mouth from out the body belch<br/>
Infuriate flame? Wherefore, the man who feigns<br/>
Such beings could have been engendered<br/>
When earth was new and the young sky was fresh<br/>
(Basing his empty argument on new)<br/>
May babble with like reason many whims<br/>
Into our ears: he'll say, perhaps, that then<br/>
Rivers of gold through every landscape flowed,<br/>
That trees were wont with precious stones to flower,<br/>
Or that in those far aeons man was born<br/>
With such gigantic length and lift of limbs<br/>
As to be able, based upon his feet,<br/>
Deep oceans to bestride or with his hands<br/>
To whirl the firmament around his head.<br/>
For though in earth were many seeds of things<br/>
In the old time when this telluric world<br/>
First poured the breeds of animals abroad,<br/>
Still that is nothing of a sign that then<br/>
Such hybrid creatures could have been begot<br/>
And limbs of all beasts heterogeneous<br/>
Have been together knit; because, indeed,<br/>
The divers kinds of grasses and the grains<br/>
And the delightsome trees&mdash;which even now<br/>
Spring up abounding from within the earth&mdash;<br/>
Can still ne'er be begotten with their stems<br/>
Begrafted into one; but each sole thing<br/>
Proceeds according to its proper wont<br/>
And all conserve their own distinctions based<br/>
In nature's fixed decree.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But mortal man<br/>
Was then far hardier in the old champaign,<br/>
As well he should be, since a hardier earth<br/>
Had him begotten; builded too was he<br/>
Of bigger and more solid bones within,<br/>
And knit with stalwart sinews through the flesh,<br/>
Nor easily seized by either heat or cold,<br/>
Or alien food or any ail or irk.<br/>
And whilst so many lustrums of the sun<br/>
Rolled on across the sky, men led a life<br/>
After the roving habit of wild beasts.<br/>
Not then were sturdy guiders of curved ploughs,<br/>
And none knew then to work the fields with iron,<br/>
Or plant young shoots in holes of delved loam,<br/>
Or lop with hooked knives from off high trees<br/>
The boughs of yester-year. What sun and rains<br/>
To them had given, what earth of own accord<br/>
Created then, was boon enough to glad<br/>
Their simple hearts. Mid acorn-laden oaks<br/>
Would they refresh their bodies for the nonce;<br/>
And the wild berries of the arbute-tree,<br/>
Which now thou seest to ripen purple-red<br/>
In winter time, the old telluric soil<br/>
Would bear then more abundant and more big.<br/>
And many coarse foods, too, in long ago<br/>
The blooming freshness of the rank young world<br/>
Produced, enough for those poor wretches there.<br/>
And rivers and springs would summon them of old<br/>
To slake the thirst, as now from the great hills<br/>
The water's down-rush calls aloud and far<br/>
The thirsty generations of the wild.<br/>
So, too, they sought the grottos of the Nymphs&mdash;<br/>
The woodland haunts discovered as they ranged&mdash;<br/>
From forth of which they knew that gliding rills<br/>
With gush and splash abounding laved the rocks,<br/>
The dripping rocks, and trickled from above<br/>
Over the verdant moss; and here and there<br/>
Welled up and burst across the open flats.<br/>
As yet they knew not to enkindle fire<br/>
Against the cold, nor hairy pelts to use<br/>
And clothe their bodies with the spoils of beasts;<br/>
But huddled in groves, and mountain-caves, and woods,<br/>
And 'mongst the thickets hid their squalid backs,<br/>
When driven to flee the lashings of the winds<br/>
And the big rains. Nor could they then regard<br/>
The general good, nor did they know to use<br/>
In common any customs, any laws:<br/>
Whatever of booty fortune unto each<br/>
Had proffered, each alone would bear away,<br/>
By instinct trained for self to thrive and live.<br/>
And Venus in the forests then would link<br/>
The lovers' bodies; for the woman yielded<br/>
Either from mutual flame, or from the man's<br/>
Impetuous fury and insatiate lust,<br/>
Or from a bribe&mdash;as acorn-nuts, choice pears,<br/>
Or the wild berries of the arbute-tree.<br/>
And trusting wondrous strength of hands and legs,<br/>
They'd chase the forest-wanderers, the beasts;<br/>
And many they'd conquer, but some few they fled,<br/>
A-skulk into their hiding-places...<br/>
</p>
<p>
With the flung stones and with the ponderous heft<br/>
Of gnarled branch. And by the time of night<br/>
O'ertaken, they would throw, like bristly boars,<br/>
Their wildman's limbs naked upon the earth,<br/>
Rolling themselves in leaves and fronded boughs.<br/>
Nor would they call with lamentations loud<br/>
Around the fields for daylight and the sun,<br/>
Quaking and wand'ring in shadows of the night;<br/>
But, silent and buried in a sleep, they'd wait<br/>
Until the sun with rosy flambeau brought<br/>
The glory to the sky. From childhood wont<br/>
Ever to see the dark and day begot<br/>
In times alternate, never might they be<br/>
Wildered by wild misgiving, lest a night<br/>
Eternal should possess the lands, with light<br/>
Of sun withdrawn forever. But their care<br/>
Was rather that the clans of savage beasts<br/>
Would often make their sleep-time horrible<br/>
For those poor wretches; and, from home y-driven,<br/>
They'd flee their rocky shelters at approach<br/>
Of boar, the spumy-lipped, or lion strong,<br/>
And in the midnight yield with terror up<br/>
To those fierce guests their beds of out-spread leaves.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And yet in those days not much more than now<br/>
Would generations of mortality<br/>
Leave the sweet light of fading life behind.<br/>
Indeed, in those days here and there a man,<br/>
More oftener snatched upon, and gulped by fangs,<br/>
Afforded the beasts a food that roared alive,<br/>
Echoing through groves and hills and forest-trees,<br/>
Even as he viewed his living flesh entombed<br/>
Within a living grave; whilst those whom flight<br/>
Had saved, with bone and body bitten, shrieked,<br/>
Pressing their quivering palms to loathsome sores,<br/>
With horrible voices for eternal death&mdash;<br/>
Until, forlorn of help, and witless what<br/>
Might medicine their wounds, the writhing pangs<br/>
Took them from life. But not in those far times<br/>
Would one lone day give over unto doom<br/>
A soldiery in thousands marching on<br/>
Beneath the battle-banners, nor would then<br/>
The ramping breakers of the main seas dash<br/>
Whole argosies and crews upon the rocks.<br/>
But ocean uprisen would often rave in vain,<br/>
Without all end or outcome, and give up<br/>
Its empty menacings as lightly too;<br/>
Nor soft seductions of a serene sea<br/>
Could lure by laughing billows any man<br/>
Out to disaster: for the science bold<br/>
Of ship-sailing lay dark in those far times.<br/>
Again, 'twas then that lack of food gave o'er<br/>
Men's fainting limbs to dissolution: now<br/>
'Tis plenty overwhelms. Unwary, they<br/>
Oft for themselves themselves would then outpour<br/>
The poison; now, with nicer art, themselves<br/>
They give the drafts to others.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards,<br/>
When huts they had procured and pelts and fire,<br/>
And when the woman, joined unto the man,<br/>
Withdrew with him into one dwelling place,<br/>
Were known; and when they saw an offspring born<br/>
From out themselves, then first the human race<br/>
Began to soften. For 'twas now that fire<br/>
Rendered their shivering frames less staunch to bear,<br/>
Under the canopy of the sky, the cold;<br/>
And Love reduced their shaggy hardiness;<br/>
And children, with the prattle and the kiss,<br/>
Soon broke the parents' haughty temper down.<br/>
Then, too, did neighbours 'gin to league as friends,<br/>
Eager to wrong no more or suffer wrong,<br/>
And urged for children and the womankind<br/>
Mercy, of fathers, whilst with cries and gestures<br/>
They stammered hints how meet it was that all<br/>
Should have compassion on the weak. And still,<br/>
Though concord not in every wise could then<br/>
Begotten be, a good, a goodly part<br/>
Kept faith inviolate&mdash;or else mankind<br/>
Long since had been unutterably cut off,<br/>
And propagation never could have brought<br/>
The species down the ages.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest, perchance,<br/>
Concerning these affairs thou ponderest<br/>
In silent meditation, let me say<br/>
'Twas lightning brought primevally to earth<br/>
The fire for mortals, and from thence hath spread<br/>
O'er all the lands the flames of heat. For thus<br/>
Even now we see so many objects, touched<br/>
By the celestial flames, to flash aglow,<br/>
When thunderbolt has dowered them with heat.<br/>
Yet also when a many-branched tree,<br/>
Beaten by winds, writhes swaying to and fro,<br/>
Pressing 'gainst branches of a neighbour tree,<br/>
There by the power of mighty rub and rub<br/>
Is fire engendered; and at times out-flares<br/>
The scorching heat of flame, when boughs do chafe<br/>
Against the trunks. And of these causes, either<br/>
May well have given to mortal men the fire.<br/>
Next, food to cook and soften in the flame<br/>
The sun instructed, since so oft they saw<br/>
How objects mellowed, when subdued by warmth<br/>
And by the raining blows of fiery beams,<br/>
Through all the fields.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more and more each day<br/>
Would men more strong in sense, more wise in heart,<br/>
Teach them to change their earlier mode and life<br/>
By fire and new devices. Kings began<br/>
Cities to found and citadels to set,<br/>
As strongholds and asylums for themselves,<br/>
And flocks and fields to portion for each man<br/>
After the beauty, strength, and sense of each&mdash;<br/>
For beauty then imported much, and strength<br/>
Had its own rights supreme. Thereafter, wealth<br/>
Discovered was, and gold was brought to light,<br/>
Which soon of honour stripped both strong and fair;<br/>
For men, however beautiful in form<br/>
Or valorous, will follow in the main<br/>
The rich man's party. Yet were man to steer<br/>
His life by sounder reasoning, he'd own<br/>
Abounding riches, if with mind content<br/>
He lived by thrift; for never, as I guess,<br/>
Is there a lack of little in the world.<br/>
But men wished glory for themselves and power<br/>
Even that their fortunes on foundations firm<br/>
Might rest forever, and that they themselves,<br/>
The opulent, might pass a quiet life&mdash;<br/>
In vain, in vain; since, in the strife to climb<br/>
On to the heights of honour, men do make<br/>
Their pathway terrible; and even when once<br/>
They reach them, envy like the thunderbolt<br/>
At times will smite, O hurling headlong down<br/>
To murkiest Tartarus, in scorn; for, lo,<br/>
All summits, all regions loftier than the rest,<br/>
Smoke, blasted as by envy's thunderbolts;<br/>
So better far in quiet to obey,<br/>
Than to desire chief mastery of affairs<br/>
And ownership of empires. Be it so;<br/>
And let the weary sweat their life-blood out<br/>
All to no end, battling in hate along<br/>
The narrow path of man's ambition;<br/>
Since all their wisdom is from others' lips,<br/>
And all they seek is known from what they've heard<br/>
And less from what they've thought. Nor is this folly<br/>
Greater to-day, nor greater soon to be,<br/>
Than' twas of old.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore kings were slain,<br/>
And pristine majesty of golden thrones<br/>
And haughty sceptres lay o'erturned in dust;<br/>
And crowns, so splendid on the sovereign heads,<br/>
Soon bloody under the proletarian feet,<br/>
Groaned for their glories gone&mdash;for erst o'er-much<br/>
Dreaded, thereafter with more greedy zest<br/>
Trampled beneath the rabble heel. Thus things<br/>
Down to the vilest lees of brawling mobs<br/>
Succumbed, whilst each man sought unto himself<br/>
Dominion and supremacy. So next<br/>
Some wiser heads instructed men to found<br/>
The magisterial office, and did frame<br/>
Codes that they might consent to follow laws.<br/>
For humankind, o'er wearied with a life<br/>
Fostered by force, was ailing from its feuds;<br/>
And so the sooner of its own free will<br/>
Yielded to laws and strictest codes. For since<br/>
Each hand made ready in its wrath to take<br/>
A vengeance fiercer than by man's fair laws<br/>
Is now conceded, men on this account<br/>
Loathed the old life fostered by force. 'Tis thence<br/>
That fear of punishments defiles each prize<br/>
Of wicked days; for force and fraud ensnare<br/>
Each man around, and in the main recoil<br/>
On him from whence they sprung. Not easy 'tis<br/>
For one who violates by ugly deeds<br/>
The bonds of common peace to pass a life<br/>
Composed and tranquil. For albeit he 'scape<br/>
The race of gods and men, he yet must dread<br/>
'Twill not be hid forever&mdash;since, indeed,<br/>
So many, oft babbling on amid their dreams<br/>
Or raving in sickness, have betrayed themselves<br/>
(As stories tell) and published at last<br/>
Old secrets and the sins.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nature 'twas<br/>
Urged men to utter various sounds of tongue<br/>
And need and use did mould the names of things,<br/>
About in same wise as the lack-speech years<br/>
Compel young children unto gesturings,<br/>
Making them point with finger here and there<br/>
At what's before them. For each creature feels<br/>
By instinct to what use to put his powers.<br/>
Ere yet the bull-calf's scarce begotten horns<br/>
Project above his brows, with them he 'gins<br/>
Enraged to butt and savagely to thrust.<br/>
But whelps of panthers and the lion's cubs<br/>
With claws and paws and bites are at the fray<br/>
Already, when their teeth and claws be scarce<br/>
As yet engendered. So again, we see<br/>
All breeds of winged creatures trust to wings<br/>
And from their fledgling pinions seek to get<br/>
A fluttering assistance. Thus, to think<br/>
That in those days some man apportioned round<br/>
To things their names, and that from him men learned<br/>
Their first nomenclature, is foolery.<br/>
For why could he mark everything by words<br/>
And utter the various sounds of tongue, what time<br/>
The rest may be supposed powerless<br/>
To do the same? And, if the rest had not<br/>
Already one with other used words,<br/>
Whence was implanted in the teacher, then,<br/>
Fore-knowledge of their use, and whence was given<br/>
To him alone primordial faculty<br/>
To know and see in mind what 'twas he willed?<br/>
Besides, one only man could scarce subdue<br/>
An overmastered multitude to choose<br/>
To get by heart his names of things. A task<br/>
Not easy 'tis in any wise to teach<br/>
And to persuade the deaf concerning what<br/>
'Tis needful for to do. For ne'er would they<br/>
Allow, nor ne'er in anywise endure<br/>
Perpetual vain dingdong in their ears<br/>
Of spoken sounds unheard before. And what,<br/>
At last, in this affair so wondrous is,<br/>
That human race (in whom a voice and tongue<br/>
Were now in vigour) should by divers words<br/>
Denote its objects, as each divers sense<br/>
Might prompt?&mdash;since even the speechless herds, aye, since<br/>
The very generations of wild beasts<br/>
Are wont dissimilar and divers sounds<br/>
To rouse from in them, when there's fear or pain,<br/>
And when they burst with joys. And this, forsooth,<br/>
'Tis thine to know from plainest facts: when first<br/>
Huge flabby jowls of mad Molossian hounds,<br/>
Baring their hard white teeth, begin to snarl,<br/>
They threaten, with infuriate lips peeled back,<br/>
In sounds far other than with which they bark<br/>
And fill with voices all the regions round.<br/>
And when with fondling tongue they start to lick<br/>
Their puppies, or do toss them round with paws,<br/>
Feigning with gentle bites to gape and snap,<br/>
They fawn with yelps of voice far other then<br/>
Than when, alone within the house, they bay,<br/>
Or whimpering slink with cringing sides from blows.<br/>
Again the neighing of the horse, is that<br/>
Not seen to differ likewise, when the stud<br/>
In buoyant flower of his young years raves,<br/>
Goaded by winged Love, amongst the mares,<br/>
And when with widening nostrils out he snorts<br/>
The call to battle, and when haply he<br/>
Whinnies at times with terror-quaking limbs?<br/>
Lastly, the flying race, the dappled birds,<br/>
Hawks, ospreys, sea-gulls, searching food and life<br/>
Amid the ocean billows in the brine,<br/>
Utter at other times far other cries<br/>
Than when they fight for food, or with their prey<br/>
Struggle and strain. And birds there are which change<br/>
With changing weather their own raucous songs&mdash;<br/>
As long-lived generations of the crows<br/>
Or flocks of rooks, when they be said to cry<br/>
For rain and water and to call at times<br/>
For winds and gales. Ergo, if divers moods<br/>
Compel the brutes, though speechless evermore,<br/>
To send forth divers sounds, O truly then<br/>
How much more likely 'twere that mortal men<br/>
In those days could with many a different sound<br/>
Denote each separate thing.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now what cause<br/>
Hath spread divinities of gods abroad<br/>
Through mighty nations, and filled the cities full<br/>
Of the high altars, and led to practices<br/>
Of solemn rites in season&mdash;rites which still<br/>
Flourish in midst of great affairs of state<br/>
And midst great centres of man's civic life,<br/>
The rites whence still a poor mortality<br/>
Is grafted that quaking awe which rears aloft<br/>
Still the new temples of gods from land to land<br/>
And drives mankind to visit them in throngs<br/>
On holy days&mdash;'tis not so hard to give<br/>
Reason thereof in speech. Because, in sooth,<br/>
Even in those days would the race of man<br/>
Be seeing excelling visages of gods<br/>
With mind awake; and in his sleeps, yet more&mdash;<br/>
Bodies of wondrous growth. And, thus, to these<br/>
Would men attribute sense, because they seemed<br/>
To move their limbs and speak pronouncements high,<br/>
Befitting glorious visage and vast powers.<br/>
And men would give them an eternal life,<br/>
Because their visages forevermore<br/>
Were there before them, and their shapes remained,<br/>
And chiefly, however, because men would not think<br/>
Beings augmented with such mighty powers<br/>
Could well by any force o'ermastered be.<br/>
And men would think them in their happiness<br/>
Excelling far, because the fear of death<br/>
Vexed no one of them at all, and since<br/>
At same time in men's sleeps men saw them do<br/>
So many wonders, and yet feel therefrom<br/>
Themselves no weariness. Besides, men marked<br/>
How in a fixed order rolled around<br/>
The systems of the sky, and changed times<br/>
Of annual seasons, nor were able then<br/>
To know thereof the causes. Therefore 'twas<br/>
Men would take refuge in consigning all<br/>
Unto divinities, and in feigning all<br/>
Was guided by their nod. And in the sky<br/>
They set the seats and vaults of gods, because<br/>
Across the sky night and the moon are seen<br/>
To roll along&mdash;moon, day, and night, and night's<br/>
Old awesome constellations evermore,<br/>
And the night-wandering fireballs of the sky,<br/>
And flying flames, clouds, and the sun, the rains,<br/>
Snow and the winds, the lightnings, and the hail,<br/>
And the swift rumblings, and the hollow roar<br/>
Of mighty menacings forevermore.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O humankind unhappy!&mdash;when it ascribed<br/>
Unto divinities such awesome deeds,<br/>
And coupled thereto rigours of fierce wrath!<br/>
What groans did men on that sad day beget<br/>
Even for themselves, and O what wounds for us,<br/>
What tears for our children's children! Nor, O man,<br/>
Is thy true piety in this: with head<br/>
Under the veil, still to be seen to turn<br/>
Fronting a stone, and ever to approach<br/>
Unto all altars; nor so prone on earth<br/>
Forward to fall, to spread upturned palms<br/>
Before the shrines of gods, nor yet to dew<br/>
Altars with profuse blood of four-foot beasts,<br/>
Nor vows with vows to link. But rather this:<br/>
To look on all things with a master eye<br/>
And mind at peace. For when we gaze aloft<br/>
Upon the skiey vaults of yon great world<br/>
And ether, fixed high o'er twinkling stars,<br/>
And into our thought there come the journeyings<br/>
Of sun and moon, O then into our breasts,<br/>
O'erburdened already with their other ills,<br/>
Begins forthwith to rear its sudden head<br/>
One more misgiving: lest o'er us, percase,<br/>
It be the gods' immeasurable power<br/>
That rolls, with varied motion, round and round<br/>
The far white constellations. For the lack<br/>
Of aught of reasons tries the puzzled mind:<br/>
Whether was ever a birth-time of the world,<br/>
And whether, likewise, any end shall be<br/>
How far the ramparts of the world can still<br/>
Outstand this strain of ever-roused motion,<br/>
Or whether, divinely with eternal weal<br/>
Endowed, they can through endless tracts of age<br/>
Glide on, defying the o'er-mighty powers<br/>
Of the immeasurable ages. Lo,<br/>
What man is there whose mind with dread of gods<br/>
Cringes not close, whose limbs with terror-spell<br/>
Crouch not together, when the parched earth<br/>
Quakes with the horrible thunderbolt amain,<br/>
And across the mighty sky the rumblings run?<br/>
Do not the peoples and the nations shake,<br/>
And haughty kings do they not hug their limbs,<br/>
Strook through with fear of the divinities,<br/>
Lest for aught foully done or madly said<br/>
The heavy time be now at hand to pay?<br/>
When, too, fierce force of fury-winds at sea<br/>
Sweepeth a navy's admiral down the main<br/>
With his stout legions and his elephants,<br/>
Doth he not seek the peace of gods with vows,<br/>
And beg in prayer, a-tremble, lulled winds<br/>
And friendly gales?&mdash;in vain, since, often up-caught<br/>
In fury-cyclones, is he borne along,<br/>
For all his mouthings, to the shoals of doom.<br/>
Ah, so irrevocably some hidden power<br/>
Betramples forevermore affairs of men,<br/>
And visibly grindeth with its heel in mire<br/>
The lictors' glorious rods and axes dire,<br/>
Having them in derision! Again, when earth<br/>
From end to end is rocking under foot,<br/>
And shaken cities ruin down, or threaten<br/>
Upon the verge, what wonder is it then<br/>
That mortal generations abase themselves,<br/>
And unto gods in all affairs of earth<br/>
Assign as last resort almighty powers<br/>
And wondrous energies to govern all?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now for the rest: copper and gold and iron<br/>
Discovered were, and with them silver's weight<br/>
And power of lead, when with prodigious heat<br/>
The conflagrations burned the forest trees<br/>
Among the mighty mountains, by a bolt<br/>
Of lightning from the sky, or else because<br/>
Men, warring in the woodlands, on their foes<br/>
Had hurled fire to frighten and dismay,<br/>
Or yet because, by goodness of the soil<br/>
Invited, men desired to clear rich fields<br/>
And turn the countryside to pasture-lands,<br/>
Or slay the wild and thrive upon the spoils.<br/>
(For hunting by pit-fall and by fire arose<br/>
Before the art of hedging the covert round<br/>
With net or stirring it with dogs of chase.)<br/>
Howso the fact, and from what cause soever<br/>
The flamy heat with awful crack and roar<br/>
Had there devoured to their deepest roots<br/>
The forest trees and baked the earth with fire,<br/>
Then from the boiling veins began to ooze<br/>
O rivulets of silver and of gold,<br/>
Of lead and copper too, collecting soon<br/>
Into the hollow places of the ground.<br/>
And when men saw the cooled lumps anon<br/>
To shine with splendour-sheen upon the ground,<br/>
Much taken with that lustrous smooth delight,<br/>
They 'gan to pry them out, and saw how each<br/>
Had got a shape like to its earthy mould.<br/>
Then would it enter their heads how these same lumps,<br/>
If melted by heat, could into any form<br/>
Or figure of things be run, and how, again,<br/>
If hammered out, they could be nicely drawn<br/>
To sharpest points or finest edge, and thus<br/>
Yield to the forgers tools and give them power<br/>
To chop the forest down, to hew the logs,<br/>
To shave the beams and planks, besides to bore<br/>
And punch and drill. And men began such work<br/>
At first as much with tools of silver and gold<br/>
As with the impetuous strength of the stout copper;<br/>
But vainly&mdash;since their over-mastered power<br/>
Would soon give way, unable to endure,<br/>
Like copper, such hard labour. In those days<br/>
Copper it was that was the thing of price;<br/>
And gold lay useless, blunted with dull edge.<br/>
Now lies the copper low, and gold hath come<br/>
Unto the loftiest honours. Thus it is<br/>
That rolling ages change the times of things:<br/>
What erst was of a price, becomes at last<br/>
A discard of no honour; whilst another<br/>
Succeeds to glory, issuing from contempt,<br/>
And day by day is sought for more and more,<br/>
And, when 'tis found, doth flower in men's praise,<br/>
Objects of wondrous honour.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Memmius,<br/>
How nature of iron discovered was, thou mayst<br/>
Of thine own self divine. Man's ancient arms<br/>
Were hands, and nails and teeth, stones too and boughs&mdash;<br/>
Breakage of forest trees&mdash;and flame and fire,<br/>
As soon as known. Thereafter force of iron<br/>
And copper discovered was; and copper's use<br/>
Was known ere iron's, since more tractable<br/>
Its nature is and its abundance more.<br/>
With copper men to work the soil began,<br/>
With copper to rouse the hurly waves of war,<br/>
To straw the monstrous wounds, and seize away<br/>
Another's flocks and fields. For unto them,<br/>
Thus armed, all things naked of defence<br/>
Readily yielded. Then by slow degrees<br/>
The sword of iron succeeded, and the shape<br/>
Of brazen sickle into scorn was turned:<br/>
With iron to cleave the soil of earth they 'gan,<br/>
And the contentions of uncertain war<br/>
Were rendered equal.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, lo, man was wont<br/>
Armed to mount upon the ribs of horse<br/>
And guide him with the rein, and play about<br/>
With right hand free, oft times before he tried<br/>
Perils of war in yoked chariot;<br/>
And yoked pairs abreast came earlier<br/>
Than yokes of four, or scythed chariots<br/>
Whereinto clomb the men-at-arms. And next<br/>
The Punic folk did train the elephants&mdash;<br/>
Those curst Lucanian oxen, hideous,<br/>
The serpent-handed, with turrets on their bulks&mdash;<br/>
To dure the wounds of war and panic-strike<br/>
The mighty troops of Mars. Thus Discord sad<br/>
Begat the one Thing after other, to be<br/>
The terror of the nations under arms,<br/>
And day by day to horrors of old war<br/>
She added an increase.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bulls, too, they tried<br/>
In war's grim business; and essayed to send<br/>
Outrageous boars against the foes. And some<br/>
Sent on before their ranks puissant lions<br/>
With armed trainers and with masters fierce<br/>
To guide and hold in chains&mdash;and yet in vain,<br/>
Since fleshed with pell-mell slaughter, fierce they flew,<br/>
And blindly through the squadrons havoc wrought,<br/>
Shaking the frightful crests upon their heads,<br/>
Now here, now there. Nor could the horsemen calm<br/>
Their horses, panic-breasted at the roar,<br/>
And rein them round to front the foe. With spring<br/>
The infuriate she-lions would up-leap<br/>
Now here, now there; and whoso came apace<br/>
Against them, these they'd rend across the face;<br/>
And others unwitting from behind they'd tear<br/>
Down from their mounts, and twining round them, bring<br/>
Tumbling to earth, o'ermastered by the wound,<br/>
And with those powerful fangs and hooked claws<br/>
Fasten upon them. Bulls would toss their friends,<br/>
And trample under foot, and from beneath<br/>
Rip flanks and bellies of horses with their horns,<br/>
And with a threat'ning forehead jam the sod;<br/>
And boars would gore with stout tusks their allies,<br/>
Splashing in fury their own blood on spears<br/>
Splintered in their own bodies, and would fell<br/>
In rout and ruin infantry and horse.<br/>
For there the beasts-of-saddle tried to scape<br/>
The savage thrusts of tusk by shying off,<br/>
Or rearing up with hoofs a-paw in air.<br/>
In vain&mdash;since there thou mightest see them sink,<br/>
Their sinews severed, and with heavy fall<br/>
Bestrew the ground. And such of these as men<br/>
Supposed well-trained long ago at home,<br/>
Were in the thick of action seen to foam<br/>
In fury, from the wounds, the shrieks, the flight,<br/>
The panic, and the tumult; nor could men<br/>
Aught of their numbers rally. For each breed<br/>
And various of the wild beasts fled apart<br/>
Hither or thither, as often in wars to-day<br/>
Flee those Lucanian oxen, by the steel<br/>
Grievously mangled, after they have wrought<br/>
Upon their friends so many a dreadful doom.<br/>
(If 'twas, indeed, that thus they did at all:<br/>
But scarcely I'll believe that men could not<br/>
With mind foreknow and see, as sure to come,<br/>
Such foul and general disaster.&mdash;This<br/>
We, then, may hold as true in the great All,<br/>
In divers worlds on divers plan create,&mdash;<br/>
Somewhere afar more likely than upon<br/>
One certain earth.) But men chose this to do<br/>
Less in the hope of conquering than to give<br/>
Their enemies a goodly cause of woe,<br/>
Even though thereby they perished themselves,<br/>
Since weak in numbers and since wanting arms.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now, clothes of roughly inter-plaited strands<br/>
Were earlier than loom-wove coverings;<br/>
The loom-wove later than man's iron is,<br/>
Since iron is needful in the weaving art,<br/>
Nor by no other means can there be wrought<br/>
Such polished tools&mdash;the treadles, spindles, shuttles,<br/>
And sounding yarn-beams. And nature forced the men,<br/>
Before the woman kind, to work the wool:<br/>
For all the male kind far excels in skill,<br/>
And cleverer is by much&mdash;until at last<br/>
The rugged farmer folk jeered at such tasks,<br/>
And so were eager soon to give them o'er<br/>
To women's hands, and in more hardy toil<br/>
To harden arms and hands.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nature herself,<br/>
Mother of things, was the first seed-sower<br/>
And primal grafter; since the berries and acorns,<br/>
Dropping from off the trees, would there beneath<br/>
Put forth in season swarms of little shoots;<br/>
Hence too men's fondness for ingrafting slips<br/>
Upon the boughs and setting out in holes<br/>
The young shrubs o'er the fields. Then would they try<br/>
Ever new modes of tilling their loved crofts,<br/>
And mark they would how earth improved the taste<br/>
Of the wild fruits by fond and fostering care.<br/>
And day by day they'd force the woods to move<br/>
Still higher up the mountain, and to yield<br/>
The place below for tilth, that there they might,<br/>
On plains and uplands, have their meadow-plats,<br/>
Cisterns and runnels, crops of standing grain,<br/>
And happy vineyards, and that all along<br/>
O'er hillocks, intervales, and plains might run<br/>
The silvery-green belt of olive-trees,<br/>
Marking the plotted landscape; even as now<br/>
Thou seest so marked with varied loveliness<br/>
All the terrain which men adorn and plant<br/>
With rows of goodly fruit-trees and hedge round<br/>
With thriving shrubberies sown.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by the mouth<br/>
To imitate the liquid notes of birds<br/>
Was earlier far 'mongst men than power to make,<br/>
By measured song, melodious verse and give<br/>
Delight to ears. And whistlings of the wind<br/>
Athrough the hollows of the reeds first taught<br/>
The peasantry to blow into the stalks<br/>
Of hollow hemlock-herb. Then bit by bit<br/>
They learned sweet plainings, such as pipe out-pours,<br/>
Beaten by finger-tips of singing men,<br/>
When heard through unpathed groves and forest deeps<br/>
And woodsy meadows, through the untrod haunts<br/>
Of shepherd folk and spots divinely still.<br/>
Thus time draws forward each and everything<br/>
Little by little unto the midst of men,<br/>
And reason uplifts it to the shores of light.<br/>
These tunes would soothe and glad the minds of mortals<br/>
When sated with food,&mdash;for songs are welcome then.<br/>
And often, lounging with friends in the soft grass<br/>
Beside a river of water, underneath<br/>
A big tree's branches, merrily they'd refresh<br/>
Their frames, with no vast outlay&mdash;most of all<br/>
If the weather were smiling and the times of the year<br/>
Were painting the green of the grass around with flowers.<br/>
Then jokes, then talk, then peals of jollity<br/>
Would circle round; for then the rustic muse<br/>
Was in her glory; then would antic Mirth<br/>
Prompt them to garland head and shoulders about<br/>
With chaplets of intertwined flowers and leaves,<br/>
And to dance onward, out of tune, with limbs<br/>
Clownishly swaying, and with clownish foot<br/>
To beat our mother earth&mdash;from whence arose<br/>
Laughter and peals of jollity, for, lo,<br/>
Such frolic acts were in their glory then,<br/>
Being more new and strange. And wakeful men<br/>
Found solaces for their unsleeping hours<br/>
In drawing forth variety of notes,<br/>
In modulating melodies, in running<br/>
With puckered lips along the tuned reeds,<br/>
Whence, even in our day do the watchmen guard<br/>
These old traditions, and have learned well<br/>
To keep true measure. And yet they no whit<br/>
Do get a larger fruit of gladsomeness<br/>
Than got the woodland aborigines<br/>
In olden times. For what we have at hand&mdash;<br/>
If theretofore naught sweeter we have known&mdash;<br/>
That chiefly pleases and seems best of all;<br/>
But then some later, likely better, find<br/>
Destroys its worth and changes our desires<br/>
Regarding good of yesterday.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus<br/>
Began the loathing of the acorn; thus<br/>
Abandoned were those beds with grasses strewn<br/>
And with the leaves beladen. Thus, again,<br/>
Fell into new contempt the pelts of beasts&mdash;<br/>
Erstwhile a robe of honour, which, I guess,<br/>
Aroused in those days envy so malign<br/>
That the first wearer went to woeful death<br/>
By ambuscades,&mdash;and yet that hairy prize,<br/>
Rent into rags by greedy foemen there<br/>
And splashed by blood, was ruined utterly<br/>
Beyond all use or vantage. Thus of old<br/>
'Twas pelts, and of to-day 'tis purple and gold<br/>
That cark men's lives with cares and weary with war.<br/>
Wherefore, methinks, resides the greater blame<br/>
With us vain men to-day: for cold would rack,<br/>
Without their pelts, the naked sons of earth;<br/>
But us it nothing hurts to do without<br/>
The purple vestment, broidered with gold<br/>
And with imposing figures, if we still<br/>
Make shift with some mean garment of the Plebs.<br/>
So man in vain futilities toils on<br/>
Forever and wastes in idle cares his years&mdash;<br/>
Because, of very truth, he hath not learnt<br/>
What the true end of getting is, nor yet<br/>
At all how far true pleasure may increase.<br/>
And 'tis desire for better and for more<br/>
Hath carried by degrees mortality<br/>
Out onward to the deep, and roused up<br/>
From the far bottom mighty waves of war.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But sun and moon, those watchmen of the world,<br/>
With their own lanterns traversing around<br/>
The mighty, the revolving vault, have taught<br/>
Unto mankind that seasons of the years<br/>
Return again, and that the Thing takes place<br/>
After a fixed plan and order fixed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Already would they pass their life, hedged round<br/>
By the strong towers; and cultivate an earth<br/>
All portioned out and boundaried; already<br/>
Would the sea flower and sail-winged ships;<br/>
Already men had, under treaty pacts,<br/>
Confederates and allies, when poets began<br/>
To hand heroic actions down in verse;<br/>
Nor long ere this had letters been devised&mdash;<br/>
Hence is our age unable to look back<br/>
On what has gone before, except where reason<br/>
Shows us a footprint.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailings on the seas,<br/>
Tillings of fields, walls, laws, and arms, and roads,<br/>
Dress and the like, all prizes, all delights<br/>
Of finer life, poems, pictures, chiselled shapes<br/>
Of polished sculptures&mdash;all these arts were learned<br/>
By practice and the mind's experience,<br/>
As men walked forward step by eager step.<br/>
Thus time draws forward each and everything<br/>
Little by little into the midst of men,<br/>
And reason uplifts it to the shores of light.<br/>
For one thing after other did men see<br/>
Grow clear by intellect, till with their arts<br/>
They've now achieved the supreme pinnacle.<br/>

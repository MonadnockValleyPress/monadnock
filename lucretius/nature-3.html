<h1>The Nature of Things</h1>
<h2>by Lucretius</h2>
<h3>Book III</h3>
O thou who first uplifted in such dark<br/>
So clear a torch aloft, who first shed light<br/>
Upon the profitable ends of man,<br/>
O thee I follow, glory of the Greeks,<br/>
And set my footsteps squarely planted now<br/>
Even in the impress and the marks of thine&mdash;<br/>
Less like one eager to dispute the palm,<br/>
More as one craving out of very love<br/>
That I may copy thee!&mdash;for how should swallow<br/>
Contend with swans or what compare could be<br/>
In a race between young kids with tumbling legs<br/>
And the strong might of the horse? Our father thou,<br/>
And finder-out of truth, and thou to us<br/>
Suppliest a father's precepts; and from out<br/>
Those scriven leaves of thine, renowned soul<br/>
(Like bees that sip of all in flowery wolds),<br/>
We feed upon thy golden sayings all&mdash;<br/>
Golden, and ever worthiest endless life.<br/>
For soon as ever thy planning thought that sprang<br/>
From god-like mind begins its loud proclaim<br/>
Of nature's courses, terrors of the brain<br/>
Asunder flee, the ramparts of the world<br/>
Dispart away, and through the void entire<br/>
I see the movements of the universe.<br/>
Rises to vision the majesty of gods,<br/>
And their abodes of everlasting calm<br/>
Which neither wind may shake nor rain-cloud splash,<br/>
Nor snow, congealed by sharp frosts, may harm<br/>
With its white downfall: ever, unclouded sky<br/>
O'er roofs, and laughs with far-diffused light.<br/>
And nature gives to them their all, nor aught<br/>
May ever pluck their peace of mind away.<br/>
But nowhere to my vision rise no more<br/>
The vaults of Acheron, though the broad earth<br/>
Bars me no more from gazing down o'er all<br/>
Which under our feet is going on below<br/>
Along the void. O, here in these affairs<br/>
Some new divine delight and trembling awe<br/>
Takes hold through me, that thus by power of thine<br/>
Nature, so plain and manifest at last,<br/>
Hath been on every side laid bare to man!<br/>
</p>
<p>
And since I've taught already of what sort<br/>
The seeds of all things are, and how, distinct<br/>
In divers forms, they flit of own accord,<br/>
Stirred with a motion everlasting on,<br/>
And in what mode things be from them create,<br/>
Now, after such matters, should my verse, meseems,<br/>
Make clear the nature of the mind and soul,<br/>
And drive that dread of Acheron without,<br/>
Headlong, which so confounds our human life<br/>
Unto its deeps, pouring o'er all that is<br/>
The black of death, nor leaves not anything<br/>
To prosper&mdash;a liquid and unsullied joy.<br/>
For as to what men sometimes will affirm:<br/>
That more than Tartarus (the realm of death)<br/>
They fear diseases and a life of shame,<br/>
And know the substance of the soul is blood,<br/>
Or rather wind (if haply thus their whim),<br/>
And so need naught of this our science, then<br/>
Thou well may'st note from what's to follow now<br/>
That more for glory do they braggart forth<br/>
Than for belief. For mark these very same:<br/>
Exiles from country, fugitives afar<br/>
From sight of men, with charges foul attaint,<br/>
Abased with every wretchedness, they yet<br/>
Live, and where'er the wretches come, they yet<br/>
Make the ancestral sacrifices there,<br/>
Butcher the black sheep, and to gods below<br/>
Offer the honours, and in bitter case<br/>
Turn much more keenly to religion.<br/>
Wherefore, it's surer testing of a man<br/>
In doubtful perils&mdash;mark him as he is<br/>
Amid adversities; for then alone<br/>
Are the true voices conjured from his breast,<br/>
The mask off-stripped, reality behind.<br/>
And greed, again, and the blind lust of honours<br/>
Which force poor wretches past the bounds of law,<br/>
And, oft allies and ministers of crime,<br/>
To push through nights and days with hugest toil<br/>
To rise untrammelled to the peaks of power&mdash;<br/>
These wounds of life in no mean part are kept<br/>
Festering and open by this fright of death.<br/>
For ever we see fierce Want and foul Disgrace<br/>
Dislodged afar from secure life and sweet,<br/>
Like huddling Shapes before the doors of death.<br/>
And whilst, from these, men wish to scape afar,<br/>
Driven by false terror, and afar remove,<br/>
With civic blood a fortune they amass,<br/>
They double their riches, greedy, heapers-up<br/>
Of corpse on corpse they have a cruel laugh<br/>
For the sad burial of a brother-born,<br/>
And hatred and fear of tables of their kin.<br/>
Likewise, through this same terror, envy oft<br/>
Makes them to peak because before their eyes<br/>
That man is lordly, that man gazed upon<br/>
Who walks begirt with honour glorious,<br/>
Whilst they in filth and darkness roll around;<br/>
Some perish away for statues and a name,<br/>
And oft to that degree, from fright of death,<br/>
Will hate of living and beholding light<br/>
Take hold on humankind that they inflict<br/>
Their own destruction with a gloomy heart&mdash;<br/>
Forgetful that this fear is font of cares,<br/>
This fear the plague upon their sense of shame,<br/>
And this that breaks the ties of comradry<br/>
And oversets all reverence and faith,<br/>
Mid direst slaughter. For long ere to-day<br/>
Often were traitors to country and dear parents<br/>
Through quest to shun the realms of Acheron.<br/>
For just as children tremble and fear all<br/>
In the viewless dark, so even we at times<br/>
Dread in the light so many things that be<br/>
No whit more fearsome than what children feign,<br/>
Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark.<br/>
This terror, then, this darkness of the mind,<br/>
Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,<br/>
Nor glittering arrows of morning sun disperse,<br/>
But only nature's aspect and her law.<br/>
</p>
<p>
First, then, I say, the mind which oft we call<br/>
The intellect, wherein is seated life's<br/>
Counsel and regimen, is part no less<br/>
Of man than hand and foot and eyes are parts<br/>
Of one whole breathing creature. [But some hold]<br/>
That sense of mind is in no fixed part seated,<br/>
But is of body some one vital state,&mdash;<br/>
Named "harmony" by Greeks, because thereby<br/>
We live with sense, though intellect be not<br/>
In any part: as oft the body is said<br/>
To have good health (when health, however, 's not<br/>
One part of him who has it), so they place<br/>
The sense of mind in no fixed part of man.<br/>
Mightily, diversly, meseems they err.<br/>
Often the body palpable and seen<br/>
Sickens, while yet in some invisible part<br/>
We feel a pleasure; oft the other way,<br/>
A miserable in mind feels pleasure still<br/>
Throughout his body&mdash;quite the same as when<br/>
A foot may pain without a pain in head.<br/>
Besides, when these our limbs are given o'er<br/>
To gentle sleep and lies the burdened frame<br/>
At random void of sense, a something else<br/>
Is yet within us, which upon that time<br/>
Bestirs itself in many a wise, receiving<br/>
All motions of joy and phantom cares of heart.<br/>
Now, for to see that in man's members dwells<br/>
Also the soul, and body ne'er is wont<br/>
To feel sensation by a "harmony"<br/>
Take this in chief: the fact that life remains<br/>
Oft in our limbs, when much of body's gone;<br/>
Yet that same life, when particles of heat,<br/>
Though few, have scattered been, and through the mouth<br/>
Air has been given forth abroad, forthwith<br/>
Forever deserts the veins, and leaves the bones.<br/>
Thus mayst thou know that not all particles<br/>
Perform like parts, nor in like manner all<br/>
Are props of weal and safety: rather those&mdash;<br/>
The seeds of wind and exhalations warm&mdash;<br/>
Take care that in our members life remains.<br/>
Therefore a vital heat and wind there is<br/>
Within the very body, which at death<br/>
Deserts our frames. And so, since nature of mind<br/>
And even of soul is found to be, as 'twere,<br/>
A part of man, give over "harmony"&mdash;<br/>
Name to musicians brought from Helicon,&mdash;<br/>
Unless themselves they filched it otherwise,<br/>
To serve for what was lacking name till then.<br/>
Whate'er it be, they're welcome to it&mdash;thou,<br/>
Hearken my other maxims.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mind and soul,<br/>
I say, are held conjoined one with other,<br/>
And form one single nature of themselves;<br/>
But chief and regnant through the frame entire<br/>
Is still that counsel which we call the mind,<br/>
And that cleaves seated in the midmost breast.<br/>
Here leap dismay and terror; round these haunts<br/>
Be blandishments of joys; and therefore here<br/>
The intellect, the mind. The rest of soul,<br/>
Throughout the body scattered, but obeys&mdash;<br/>
Moved by the nod and motion of the mind.<br/>
This, for itself, sole through itself, hath thought;<br/>
This for itself hath mirth, even when the thing<br/>
That moves it, moves nor soul nor body at all.<br/>
And as, when head or eye in us is smit<br/>
By assailing pain, we are not tortured then<br/>
Through all the body, so the mind alone<br/>
Is sometimes smitten, or livens with a joy,<br/>
Whilst yet the soul's remainder through the limbs<br/>
And through the frame is stirred by nothing new.<br/>
But when the mind is moved by shock more fierce,<br/>
We mark the whole soul suffering all at once<br/>
Along man's members: sweats and pallors spread<br/>
Over the body, and the tongue is broken,<br/>
And fails the voice away, and ring the ears,<br/>
Mists blind the eyeballs, and the joints collapse,&mdash;<br/>
Aye, men drop dead from terror of the mind.<br/>
Hence, whoso will can readily remark<br/>
That soul conjoined is with mind, and, when<br/>
'Tis strook by influence of the mind, forthwith<br/>
In turn it hits and drives the body too.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And this same argument establisheth<br/>
That nature of mind and soul corporeal is:<br/>
For when 'tis seen to drive the members on,<br/>
To snatch from sleep the body, and to change<br/>
The countenance, and the whole state of man<br/>
To rule and turn,&mdash;what yet could never be<br/>
Sans contact, and sans body contact fails&mdash;<br/>
Must we not grant that mind and soul consist<br/>
Of a corporeal nature?&mdash;And besides<br/>
Thou markst that likewise with this body of ours<br/>
Suffers the mind and with our body feels.<br/>
If the dire speed of spear that cleaves the bones<br/>
And bares the inner thews hits not the life,<br/>
Yet follows a fainting and a foul collapse,<br/>
And, on the ground, dazed tumult in the mind,<br/>
And whiles a wavering will to rise afoot.<br/>
So nature of mind must be corporeal, since<br/>
From stroke and spear corporeal 'tis in throes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now, of what body, what components formed<br/>
Is this same mind I will go on to tell.<br/>
First, I aver, 'tis superfine, composed<br/>
Of tiniest particles&mdash;that such the fact<br/>
Thou canst perceive, if thou attend, from this:<br/>
Nothing is seen to happen with such speed<br/>
As what the mind proposes and begins;<br/>
Therefore the same bestirs itself more swiftly<br/>
Than aught whose nature's palpable to eyes.<br/>
But what's so agile must of seeds consist<br/>
Most round, most tiny, that they may be moved,<br/>
When hit by impulse slight. So water moves,<br/>
In waves along, at impulse just the least&mdash;<br/>
Being create of little shapes that roll;<br/>
But, contrariwise, the quality of honey<br/>
More stable is, its liquids more inert,<br/>
More tardy its flow; for all its stock of matter<br/>
Cleaves more together, since, indeed, 'tis made<br/>
Of atoms not so smooth, so fine, and round.<br/>
For the light breeze that hovers yet can blow<br/>
High heaps of poppy-seed away for thee<br/>
Downward from off the top; but, contrariwise,<br/>
A pile of stones or spiny ears of wheat<br/>
It can't at all. Thus, in so far as bodies<br/>
Are small and smooth, is their mobility;<br/>
But, contrariwise, the heavier and more rough,<br/>
The more immovable they prove. Now, then,<br/>
Since nature of mind is movable so much,<br/>
Consist it must of seeds exceeding small<br/>
And smooth and round. Which fact once known to thee,<br/>
Good friend, will serve thee opportune in else.<br/>
This also shows the nature of the same,<br/>
How nice its texture, in how small a space<br/>
'Twould go, if once compacted as a pellet:<br/>
When death's unvexed repose gets hold on man<br/>
And mind and soul retire, thou markest there<br/>
From the whole body nothing ta'en in form,<br/>
Nothing in weight. Death grants ye everything,<br/>
But vital sense and exhalation hot.<br/>
Thus soul entire must be of smallmost seeds,<br/>
Twined through the veins, the vitals, and the thews,<br/>
Seeing that, when 'tis from whole body gone,<br/>
The outward figuration of the limbs<br/>
Is unimpaired and weight fails not a whit.<br/>
Just so, when vanished the bouquet of wine,<br/>
Or when an unguent's perfume delicate<br/>
Into the winds away departs, or when<br/>
From any body savour's gone, yet still<br/>
The thing itself seems minished naught to eyes,<br/>
Thereby, nor aught abstracted from its weight&mdash;<br/>
No marvel, because seeds many and minute<br/>
Produce the savours and the redolence<br/>
In the whole body of the things. And so,<br/>
Again, again, nature of mind and soul<br/>
'Tis thine to know created is of seeds<br/>
The tiniest ever, since at flying-forth<br/>
It beareth nothing of the weight away.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Yet fancy not its nature simple so.<br/>
For an impalpable aura, mixed with heat,<br/>
Deserts the dying, and heat draws off the air;<br/>
And heat there's none, unless commixed with air:<br/>
For, since the nature of all heat is rare,<br/>
Athrough it many seeds of air must move.<br/>
Thus nature of mind is triple; yet those all<br/>
Suffice not for creating sense&mdash;since mind<br/>
Accepteth not that aught of these can cause<br/>
Sense-bearing motions, and much less the thoughts<br/>
A man revolves in mind. So unto these<br/>
Must added be a somewhat, and a fourth;<br/>
That somewhat's altogether void of name;<br/>
Than which existeth naught more mobile, naught<br/>
More an impalpable, of elements<br/>
More small and smooth and round. That first transmits<br/>
Sense-bearing motions through the frame, for that<br/>
Is roused the first, composed of little shapes;<br/>
Thence heat and viewless force of wind take up<br/>
The motions, and thence air, and thence all things<br/>
Are put in motion; the blood is strook, and then<br/>
The vitals all begin to feel, and last<br/>
To bones and marrow the sensation comes&mdash;<br/>
Pleasure or torment. Nor will pain for naught<br/>
Enter so far, nor a sharp ill seep through,<br/>
But all things be perturbed to that degree<br/>
That room for life will fail, and parts of soul<br/>
Will scatter through the body's every pore.<br/>
Yet as a rule, almost upon the skin<br/>
These motion aIl are stopped, and this is why<br/>
We have the power to retain our life.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now in my eagerness to tell thee how<br/>
They are commixed, through what unions fit<br/>
They function so, my country's pauper-speech<br/>
Constrains me sadly. As I can, however,<br/>
I'll touch some points and pass. In such a wise<br/>
Course these primordials 'mongst one another<br/>
With inter-motions that no one can be<br/>
From other sundered, nor its agency<br/>
Perform, if once divided by a space;<br/>
Like many powers in one body they work.<br/>
As in the flesh of any creature still<br/>
Is odour and savour and a certain warmth,<br/>
And yet from all of these one bulk of body<br/>
Is made complete, so, viewless force of wind<br/>
And warmth and air, commingled, do create<br/>
One nature, by that mobile energy<br/>
Assisted which from out itself to them<br/>
Imparts initial motion, whereby first<br/>
Sense-bearing motion along the vitals springs.<br/>
For lurks this essence far and deep and under,<br/>
Nor in our body is aught more shut from view,<br/>
And 'tis the very soul of all the soul.<br/>
And as within our members and whole frame<br/>
The energy of mind and power of soul<br/>
Is mixed and latent, since create it is<br/>
Of bodies small and few, so lurks this fourth,<br/>
This essence void of name, composed of small,<br/>
And seems the very soul of all the soul,<br/>
And holds dominion o'er the body all.<br/>
And by like reason wind and air and heat<br/>
Must function so, commingled through the frame,<br/>
And now the one subside and now another<br/>
In interchange of dominance, that thus<br/>
From all of them one nature be produced,<br/>
Lest heat and wind apart, and air apart,<br/>
Make sense to perish, by disseverment.<br/>
There is indeed in mind that heat it gets<br/>
When seething in rage, and flashes from the eyes<br/>
More swiftly fire; there is, again, that wind,<br/>
Much, and so cold, companion of all dread,<br/>
Which rouses the shudder in the shaken frame;<br/>
There is no less that state of air composed,<br/>
Making the tranquil breast, the serene face.<br/>
But more of hot have they whose restive hearts,<br/>
Whose minds of passion quickly seethe in rage&mdash;<br/>
Of which kind chief are fierce abounding lions,<br/>
Who often with roaring burst the breast o'erwrought,<br/>
Unable to hold the surging wrath within;<br/>
But the cold mind of stags has more of wind,<br/>
And speedier through their inwards rouses up<br/>
The icy currents which make their members quake.<br/>
But more the oxen live by tranquil air,<br/>
Nor e'er doth smoky torch of wrath applied,<br/>
O'erspreading with shadows of a darkling murk,<br/>
Rouse them too far; nor will they stiffen stark,<br/>
Pierced through by icy javelins of fear;<br/>
But have their place half-way between the two&mdash;<br/>
Stags and fierce lions. Thus the race of men:<br/>
Though training make them equally refined,<br/>
It leaves those pristine vestiges behind<br/>
Of each mind's nature. Nor may we suppose<br/>
Evil can e'er be rooted up so far<br/>
That one man's not more given to fits of wrath,<br/>
Another's not more quickly touched by fear,<br/>
A third not more long-suffering than he should.<br/>
And needs must differ in many things besides<br/>
The varied natures and resulting habits<br/>
Of humankind&mdash;of which not now can I<br/>
Expound the hidden causes, nor find names<br/>
Enough for all the divers shapes of those<br/>
Primordials whence this variation springs.<br/>
But this meseems I'm able to declare:<br/>
Those vestiges of natures left behind<br/>
Which reason cannot quite expel from us<br/>
Are still so slight that naught prevents a man<br/>
From living a life even worthy of the gods.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So then this soul is kept by all the body,<br/>
Itself the body's guard, and source of weal:<br/>
For they with common roots cleave each to each,<br/>
Nor can be torn asunder without death.<br/>
Not easy 'tis from lumps of frankincense<br/>
To tear their fragrance forth, without its nature<br/>
Perishing likewise: so, not easy 'tis<br/>
From all the body nature of mind and soul<br/>
To draw away, without the whole dissolved.<br/>
With seeds so intertwined even from birth,<br/>
They're dowered conjointly with a partner-life;<br/>
No energy of body or mind, apart,<br/>
Each of itself without the other's power,<br/>
Can have sensation; but our sense, enkindled<br/>
Along the vitals, to flame is blown by both<br/>
With mutual motions. Besides the body alone<br/>
Is nor begot nor grows, nor after death<br/>
Seen to endure. For not as water at times<br/>
Gives off the alien heat, nor is thereby<br/>
Itself destroyed, but unimpaired remains&mdash;<br/>
Not thus, I say, can the deserted frame<br/>
Bear the dissevering of its joined soul,<br/>
But, rent and ruined, moulders all away.<br/>
Thus the joint contact of the body and soul<br/>
Learns from their earliest age the vital motions,<br/>
Even when still buried in the mother's womb;<br/>
So no dissevering can hap to them,<br/>
Without their bane and ill. And thence mayst see<br/>
That, as conjoined is their source of weal,<br/>
Conjoined also must their nature be.<br/>
</p>
<p>
If one, moreover, denies that body feel,<br/>
And holds that soul, through all the body mixed,<br/>
Takes on this motion which we title "sense,"<br/>
He battles in vain indubitable facts:<br/>
For who'll explain what body's feeling is,<br/>
Except by what the public fact itself<br/>
Has given and taught us?"But when soul is parted,<br/>
Body's without all sense." True!&mdash;loses what<br/>
Was even in its life-time not its own;<br/>
And much beside it loses, when soul's driven<br/>
Forth from that life-time. Or, to say that eyes<br/>
Themselves can see no thing, but through the same<br/>
The mind looks forth, as out of opened doors,<br/>
Is&mdash;a hard saying; since the feel in eyes<br/>
Says the reverse. For this itself draws on<br/>
And forces into the pupils of our eyes<br/>
Our consciousness. And note the case when often<br/>
We lack the power to see refulgent things,<br/>
Because our eyes are hampered by their light&mdash;<br/>
With a mere doorway this would happen not;<br/>
For, since it is our very selves that see,<br/>
No open portals undertake the toil.<br/>
Besides, if eyes of ours but act as doors,<br/>
Methinks that, were our sight removed, the mind<br/>
Ought then still better to behold a thing&mdash;<br/>
When even the door-posts have been cleared away.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Herein in these affairs nowise take up<br/>
What honoured sage, Democritus, lays down&mdash;<br/>
That proposition, that primordials<br/>
Of body and mind, each super-posed on each,<br/>
Vary alternately and interweave<br/>
The fabric of our members. For not only<br/>
Are the soul-elements smaller far than those<br/>
Which this our body and inward parts compose,<br/>
But also are they in their number less,<br/>
And scattered sparsely through our frame. And thus<br/>
This canst thou guarantee: soul's primal germs<br/>
Maintain between them intervals as large<br/>
At least as are the smallest bodies, which,<br/>
When thrown against us, in our body rouse<br/>
Sense-bearing motions. Hence it comes that we<br/>
Sometimes don't feel alighting on our frames<br/>
The clinging dust, or chalk that settles soft;<br/>
Nor mists of night, nor spider's gossamer<br/>
We feel against us, when, upon our road,<br/>
Its net entangles us, nor on our head<br/>
The dropping of its withered garmentings;<br/>
Nor bird-feathers, nor vegetable down,<br/>
Flying about, so light they barely fall;<br/>
Nor feel the steps of every crawling thing,<br/>
Nor each of all those footprints on our skin<br/>
Of midges and the like. To that degree<br/>
Must many primal germs be stirred in us<br/>
Ere once the seeds of soul that through our frame<br/>
Are intermingled 'gin to feel that those<br/>
Primordials of the body have been strook,<br/>
And ere, in pounding with such gaps between,<br/>
They clash, combine and leap apart in turn.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But mind is more the keeper of the gates,<br/>
Hath more dominion over life than soul.<br/>
For without intellect and mind there's not<br/>
One part of soul can rest within our frame<br/>
Least part of time; companioning, it goes<br/>
With mind into the winds away, and leaves<br/>
The icy members in the cold of death.<br/>
But he whose mind and intellect abide<br/>
Himself abides in life. However much<br/>
The trunk be mangled, with the limbs lopped off,<br/>
The soul withdrawn and taken from the limbs,<br/>
Still lives the trunk and draws the vital air.<br/>
Even when deprived of all but all the soul,<br/>
Yet will it linger on and cleave to life,&mdash;<br/>
Just as the power of vision still is strong,<br/>
If but the pupil shall abide unharmed,<br/>
Even when the eye around it's sorely rent&mdash;<br/>
Provided only thou destroyest not<br/>
Wholly the ball, but, cutting round the pupil,<br/>
Leavest that pupil by itself behind&mdash;<br/>
For more would ruin sight. But if that centre,<br/>
That tiny part of eye, be eaten through,<br/>
Forthwith the vision fails and darkness comes,<br/>
Though in all else the unblemished ball be clear.<br/>
'Tis by like compact that the soul and mind<br/>
Are each to other bound forevermore.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<p>
Now come: that thou mayst able be to know<br/>
That minds and the light souls of all that live<br/>
Have mortal birth and death, I will go on<br/>
Verses to build meet for thy rule of life,<br/>
Sought after long, discovered with sweet toil.<br/>
But under one name I'd have thee yoke them both;<br/>
And when, for instance, I shall speak of soul,<br/>
Teaching the same to be but mortal, think<br/>
Thereby I'm speaking also of the mind&mdash;<br/>
Since both are one, a substance inter-joined.<br/>
First, then, since I have taught how soul exists<br/>
A subtle fabric, of particles minute,<br/>
Made up from atoms smaller much than those<br/>
Of water's liquid damp, or fog, or smoke,<br/>
So in mobility it far excels,<br/>
More prone to move, though strook by lighter cause<br/>
Even moved by images of smoke or fog&mdash;<br/>
As where we view, when in our sleeps we're lulled,<br/>
The altars exhaling steam and smoke aloft&mdash;<br/>
For, beyond doubt, these apparitions come<br/>
To us from outward. Now, then, since thou seest,<br/>
Their liquids depart, their waters flow away,<br/>
When jars are shivered, and since fog and smoke<br/>
Depart into the winds away, believe<br/>
The soul no less is shed abroad and dies<br/>
More quickly far, more quickly is dissolved<br/>
Back to its primal bodies, when withdrawn<br/>
From out man's members it has gone away.<br/>
For, sure, if body (container of the same<br/>
Like as a jar), when shivered from some cause,<br/>
And rarefied by loss of blood from veins,<br/>
Cannot for longer hold the soul, how then<br/>
Thinkst thou it can be held by any air&mdash;<br/>
A stuff much rarer than our bodies be?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Besides we feel that mind to being comes<br/>
Along with body, with body grows and ages.<br/>
For just as children totter round about<br/>
With frames infirm and tender, so there follows<br/>
A weakling wisdom in their minds; and then,<br/>
Where years have ripened into robust powers,<br/>
Counsel is also greater, more increased<br/>
The power of mind; thereafter, where already<br/>
The body's shattered by master-powers of eld,<br/>
And fallen the frame with its enfeebled powers,<br/>
Thought hobbles, tongue wanders, and the mind gives way;<br/>
All fails, all's lacking at the selfsame time.<br/>
Therefore it suits that even the soul's dissolved,<br/>
Like smoke, into the lofty winds of air;<br/>
Since we behold the same to being come<br/>
Along with body and grow, and, as I've taught,<br/>
Crumble and crack, therewith outworn by eld.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then, too, we see, that, just as body takes<br/>
Monstrous diseases and the dreadful pain,<br/>
So mind its bitter cares, the grief, the fear;<br/>
Wherefore it tallies that the mind no less<br/>
Partaker is of death; for pain and disease<br/>
Are both artificers of death,&mdash;as well<br/>
We've learned by the passing of many a man ere now.<br/>
Nay, too, in diseases of body, often the mind<br/>
Wanders afield; for 'tis beside itself,<br/>
And crazed it speaks, or many a time it sinks,<br/>
With eyelids closing and a drooping nod,<br/>
In heavy drowse, on to eternal sleep;<br/>
From whence nor hears it any voices more,<br/>
Nor able is to know the faces here<br/>
Of those about him standing with wet cheeks<br/>
Who vainly call him back to light and life.<br/>
Wherefore mind too, confess we must, dissolves,<br/>
Seeing, indeed, contagions of disease<br/>
Enter into the same. Again, O why,<br/>
When the strong wine has entered into man,<br/>
And its diffused fire gone round the veins,<br/>
Why follows then a heaviness of limbs,<br/>
A tangle of the legs as round he reels,<br/>
A stuttering tongue, an intellect besoaked,<br/>
Eyes all aswim, and hiccups, shouts, and brawls,<br/>
And whatso else is of that ilk?&mdash;Why this?&mdash;<br/>
If not that violent and impetuous wine<br/>
Is wont to confound the soul within the body?<br/>
But whatso can confounded be and balked,<br/>
Gives proof, that if a hardier cause got in,<br/>
'Twould hap that it would perish then, bereaved<br/>
Of any life thereafter. And, moreover,<br/>
Often will some one in a sudden fit,<br/>
As if by stroke of lightning, tumble down<br/>
Before our eyes, and sputter foam, and grunt,<br/>
Blither, and twist about with sinews taut,<br/>
Gasp up in starts, and weary out his limbs<br/>
With tossing round. No marvel, since distract<br/>
Through frame by violence of disease.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Confounds, he foams, as if to vomit soul,<br/>
As on the salt sea boil the billows round<br/>
Under the master might of winds. And now<br/>
A groan's forced out, because his limbs are griped,<br/>
But, in the main, because the seeds of voice<br/>
Are driven forth and carried in a mass<br/>
Outwards by mouth, where they are wont to go,<br/>
And have a builded highway. He becomes<br/>
Mere fool, since energy of mind and soul<br/>
Confounded is, and, as I've shown, to-riven,<br/>
Asunder thrown, and torn to pieces all<br/>
By the same venom. But, again, where cause<br/>
Of that disease has faced about, and back<br/>
Retreats sharp poison of corrupted frame<br/>
Into its shadowy lairs, the man at first<br/>
Arises reeling, and gradually comes back<br/>
To all his senses and recovers soul.<br/>
Thus, since within the body itself of man<br/>
The mind and soul are by such great diseases<br/>
Shaken, so miserably in labour distraught,<br/>
Why, then, believe that in the open air,<br/>
Without a body, they can pass their life,<br/>
Immortal, battling with the master winds?<br/>
And, since we mark the mind itself is cured,<br/>
Like the sick body, and restored can be<br/>
By medicine, this is forewarning too<br/>
That mortal lives the mind. For proper it is<br/>
That whosoe'er begins and undertakes<br/>
To alter the mind, or meditates to change<br/>
Any another nature soever, should add<br/>
New parts, or readjust the order given,<br/>
Or from the sum remove at least a bit.<br/>
But what's immortal willeth for itself<br/>
Its parts be nor increased, nor rearranged,<br/>
Nor any bit soever flow away:<br/>
For change of anything from out its bounds<br/>
Means instant death of that which was before.<br/>
Ergo, the mind, whether in sickness fallen,<br/>
Or by the medicine restored, gives signs,<br/>
As I have taught, of its mortality.<br/>
So surely will a fact of truth make head<br/>
'Gainst errors' theories all, and so shut off<br/>
All refuge from the adversary, and rout<br/>
Error by two-edged confutation.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And since the mind is of a man one part,<br/>
Which in one fixed place remains, like ears,<br/>
And eyes, and every sense which pilots life;<br/>
And just as hand, or eye, or nose, apart,<br/>
Severed from us, can neither feel nor be,<br/>
But in the least of time is left to rot,<br/>
Thus mind alone can never be, without<br/>
The body and the man himself, which seems,<br/>
As 'twere the vessel of the same&mdash;or aught<br/>
Whate'er thou'lt feign as yet more closely joined:<br/>
Since body cleaves to mind by surest bonds.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Again, the body's and the mind's live powers<br/>
Only in union prosper and enjoy;<br/>
For neither can nature of mind, alone of self<br/>
Sans body, give the vital motions forth;<br/>
Nor, then, can body, wanting soul, endure<br/>
And use the senses. Verily, as the eye,<br/>
Alone, up-rended from its roots, apart<br/>
From all the body, can peer about at naught,<br/>
So soul and mind it seems are nothing able,<br/>
When by themselves. No marvel, because, commixed<br/>
Through veins and inwards, and through bones and thews,<br/>
Their elements primordial are confined<br/>
By all the body, and own no power free<br/>
To bound around through interspaces big,<br/>
Thus, shut within these confines, they take on<br/>
Motions of sense, which, after death, thrown out<br/>
Beyond the body to the winds of air,<br/>
Take on they cannot&mdash;and on this account,<br/>
Because no more in such a way confined.<br/>
For air will be a body, be alive,<br/>
If in that air the soul can keep itself,<br/>
And in that air enclose those motions all<br/>
Which in the thews and in the body itself<br/>
A while ago 'twas making. So for this,<br/>
Again, again, I say confess we must,<br/>
That, when the body's wrappings are unwound,<br/>
And when the vital breath is forced without,<br/>
The soul, the senses of the mind dissolve,&mdash;<br/>
Since for the twain the cause and ground of life<br/>
Is in the fact of their conjoined estate.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Once more, since body's unable to sustain<br/>
Division from the soul, without decay<br/>
And obscene stench, how canst thou doubt but that<br/>
The soul, uprisen from the body's deeps,<br/>
Has filtered away, wide-drifted like a smoke,<br/>
Or that the changed body crumbling fell<br/>
With ruin so entire, because, indeed,<br/>
Its deep foundations have been moved from place,<br/>
The soul out-filtering even through the frame,<br/>
And through the body's every winding way<br/>
And orifice? And so by many means<br/>
Thou'rt free to learn that nature of the soul<br/>
Hath passed in fragments out along the frame,<br/>
And that 'twas shivered in the very body<br/>
Ere ever it slipped abroad and swam away<br/>
Into the winds of air. For never a man<br/>
Dying appears to feel the soul go forth<br/>
As one sure whole from all his body at once,<br/>
Nor first come up the throat and into mouth;<br/>
But feels it failing in a certain spot,<br/>
Even as he knows the senses too dissolve<br/>
Each in its own location in the frame.<br/>
But were this mind of ours immortal mind,<br/>
Dying 'twould scarce bewail a dissolution,<br/>
But rather the going, the leaving of its coat,<br/>
Like to a snake. Wherefore, when once the body<br/>
Hath passed away, admit we must that soul,<br/>
Shivered in all that body, perished too.<br/>
Nay, even when moving in the bounds of life,<br/>
Often the soul, now tottering from some cause,<br/>
Craves to go out, and from the frame entire<br/>
Loosened to be; the countenance becomes<br/>
Flaccid, as if the supreme hour were there;<br/>
And flabbily collapse the members all<br/>
Against the bloodless trunk&mdash;the kind of case<br/>
We see when we remark in common phrase,<br/>
"That man's quite gone," or "fainted dead away";<br/>
And where there's now a bustle of alarm,<br/>
And all are eager to get some hold upon<br/>
The man's last link of life. For then the mind<br/>
And all the power of soul are shook so sore,<br/>
And these so totter along with all the frame,<br/>
That any cause a little stronger might<br/>
Dissolve them altogether.&mdash;Why, then, doubt<br/>
That soul, when once without the body thrust,<br/>
There in the open, an enfeebled thing,<br/>
Its wrappings stripped away, cannot endure<br/>
Not only through no everlasting age,<br/>
But even, indeed, through not the least of time?<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then, too, why never is the intellect,<br/>
The counselling mind, begotten in the head,<br/>
The feet, the hands, instead of cleaving still<br/>
To one sole seat, to one fixed haunt, the breast,<br/>
If not that fixed places be assigned<br/>
For each thing's birth, where each, when 'tis create,<br/>
Is able to endure, and that our frames<br/>
Have such complex adjustments that no shift<br/>
In order of our members may appear?<br/>
To that degree effect succeeds to cause,<br/>
Nor is the flame once wont to be create<br/>
In flowing streams, nor cold begot in fire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Besides, if nature of soul immortal be,<br/>
And able to feel, when from our frame disjoined,<br/>
The same, I fancy, must be thought to be<br/>
Endowed with senses five,&mdash;nor is there way<br/>
But this whereby to image to ourselves<br/>
How under-souls may roam in Acheron.<br/>
Thus painters and the elder race of bards<br/>
Have pictured souls with senses so endowed.<br/>
But neither eyes, nor nose, nor hand, alone<br/>
Apart from body can exist for soul,<br/>
Nor tongue nor ears apart. And hence indeed<br/>
Alone by self they can nor feel nor be.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And since we mark the vital sense to be<br/>
In the whole body, all one living thing,<br/>
If of a sudden a force with rapid stroke<br/>
Should slice it down the middle and cleave in twain,<br/>
Beyond a doubt likewise the soul itself,<br/>
Divided, dissevered, asunder will be flung<br/>
Along with body. But what severed is<br/>
And into sundry parts divides, indeed<br/>
Admits it owns no everlasting nature.<br/>
We hear how chariots of war, areek<br/>
With hurly slaughter, lop with flashing scythes<br/>
The limbs away so suddenly that there,<br/>
Fallen from the trunk, they quiver on the earth,<br/>
The while the mind and powers of the man<br/>
Can feel no pain, for swiftness of his hurt,<br/>
And sheer abandon in the zest of battle:<br/>
With the remainder of his frame he seeks<br/>
Anew the battle and the slaughter, nor marks<br/>
How the swift wheels and scythes of ravin have dragged<br/>
Off with the horses his left arm and shield;<br/>
Nor other how his right has dropped away,<br/>
Mounting again and on. A third attempts<br/>
With leg dismembered to arise and stand,<br/>
Whilst, on the ground hard by, the dying foot<br/>
Twitches its spreading toes. And even the head,<br/>
When from the warm and living trunk lopped off,<br/>
Keeps on the ground the vital countenance<br/>
And open eyes, until 't has rendered up<br/>
All remnants of the soul. Nay, once again:<br/>
If, when a serpent's darting forth its tongue,<br/>
And lashing its tail, thou gettest chance to hew<br/>
With axe its length of trunk to many parts,<br/>
Thou'lt see each severed fragment writhing round<br/>
With its fresh wound, and spattering up the sod,<br/>
And there the fore-part seeking with the jaws<br/>
After the hinder, with bite to stop the pain.<br/>
So shall we say that these be souls entire<br/>
In all those fractions?&mdash;but from that 'twould follow<br/>
One creature'd have in body many souls.<br/>
Therefore, the soul, which was indeed but one,<br/>
Has been divided with the body too:<br/>
Each is but mortal, since alike is each<br/>
Hewn into many parts. Again, how often<br/>
We view our fellow going by degrees,<br/>
And losing limb by limb the vital sense;<br/>
First nails and fingers of the feet turn blue,<br/>
Next die the feet and legs, then o'er the rest<br/>
Slow crawl the certain footsteps of cold death.<br/>
And since this nature of the soul is torn,<br/>
Nor mounts away, as at one time, entire,<br/>
We needs must hold it mortal. But perchance<br/>
If thou supposest that the soul itself<br/>
Can inward draw along the frame, and bring<br/>
Its parts together to one place, and so<br/>
From all the members draw the sense away,<br/>
Why, then, that place in which such stock of soul<br/>
Collected is, should greater seem in sense.<br/>
But since such place is nowhere, for a fact,<br/>
As said before, 'tis rent and scattered forth,<br/>
And so goes under. Or again, if now<br/>
I please to grant the false, and say that soul<br/>
Can thus be lumped within the frames of those<br/>
Who leave the sunshine, dying bit by bit,<br/>
Still must the soul as mortal be confessed;<br/>
Nor aught it matters whether to wrack it go,<br/>
Dispersed in the winds, or, gathered in a mass<br/>
From all its parts, sink down to brutish death,<br/>
Since more and more in every region sense<br/>
Fails the whole man, and less and less of life<br/>
In every region lingers.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And besides,<br/>
If soul immortal is, and winds its way<br/>
Into the body at the birth of man,<br/>
Why can we not remember something, then,<br/>
Of life-time spent before? why keep we not<br/>
Some footprints of the things we did of, old?<br/>
But if so changed hath been the power of mind,<br/>
That every recollection of things done<br/>
Is fallen away, at no o'erlong remove<br/>
Is that, I trow, from what we mean by death.<br/>
Wherefore 'tis sure that what hath been before<br/>
Hath died, and what now is is now create.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Moreover, if after the body hath been built<br/>
Our mind's live powers are wont to be put in,<br/>
Just at the moment that we come to birth,<br/>
And cross the sills of life, 'twould scarcely fit<br/>
For them to live as if they seemed to grow<br/>
Along with limbs and frame, even in the blood,<br/>
But rather as in a cavern all alone.<br/>
(Yet all the body duly throngs with sense.)<br/>
But public fact declares against all this:<br/>
For soul is so entwined through the veins,<br/>
The flesh, the thews, the bones, that even the teeth<br/>
Share in sensation, as proven by dull ache,<br/>
By twinge from icy water, or grating crunch<br/>
Upon a stone that got in mouth with bread.<br/>
Wherefore, again, again, souls must be thought<br/>
Nor void of birth, nor free from law of death;<br/>
Nor, if, from outward, in they wound their way,<br/>
Could they be thought as able so to cleave<br/>
To these our frames, nor, since so interwove,<br/>
Appears it that they're able to go forth<br/>
Unhurt and whole and loose themselves unscathed<br/>
From all the thews, articulations, bones.<br/>
But, if perchance thou thinkest that the soul,<br/>
From outward winding in its way, is wont<br/>
To seep and soak along these members ours,<br/>
Then all the more 'twill perish, being thus<br/>
With body fused&mdash;for what will seep and soak<br/>
Will be dissolved and will therefore die.<br/>
For just as food, dispersed through all the pores<br/>
Of body, and passed through limbs and all the frame,<br/>
Perishes, supplying from itself the stuff<br/>
For other nature, thus the soul and mind,<br/>
Though whole and new into a body going,<br/>
Are yet, by seeping in, dissolved away,<br/>
Whilst, as through pores, to all the frame there pass<br/>
Those particles from which created is<br/>
This nature of mind, now ruler of our body,<br/>
Born from that soul which perished, when divided<br/>
Along the frame. Wherefore it seems that soul<br/>
Hath both a natal and funeral hour.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Besides are seeds of soul there left behind<br/>
In the breathless body, or not? If there they are,<br/>
It cannot justly be immortal deemed,<br/>
Since, shorn of some parts lost, 'thas gone away:<br/>
But if, borne off with members uncorrupt,<br/>
'Thas fled so absolutely all away<br/>
It leaves not one remainder of itself<br/>
Behind in body, whence do cadavers, then,<br/>
From out their putrid flesh exhale the worms,<br/>
And whence does such a mass of living things,<br/>
Boneless and bloodless, o'er the bloated frame<br/>
Bubble and swarm? But if perchance thou thinkest<br/>
That souls from outward into worms can wind,<br/>
And each into a separate body come,<br/>
And reckonest not why many thousand souls<br/>
Collect where only one has gone away,<br/>
Here is a point, in sooth, that seems to need<br/>
Inquiry and a putting to the test:<br/>
Whether the souls go on a hunt for seeds<br/>
Of worms wherewith to build their dwelling places,<br/>
Or enter bodies ready-made, as 'twere.<br/>
But why themselves they thus should do and toil<br/>
'Tis hard to say, since, being free of body,<br/>
They flit around, harassed by no disease,<br/>
Nor cold nor famine; for the body labours<br/>
By more of kinship to these flaws of life,<br/>
And mind by contact with that body suffers<br/>
So many ills. But grant it be for them<br/>
However useful to construct a body<br/>
To which to enter in, 'tis plain they can't.<br/>
Then, souls for self no frames nor bodies make,<br/>
Nor is there how they once might enter in<br/>
To bodies ready-made&mdash;for they cannot<br/>
Be nicely interwoven with the same,<br/>
And there'll be formed no interplay of sense<br/>
Common to each.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, why is't there goes<br/>
Impetuous rage with lion's breed morose,<br/>
And cunning with foxes, and to deer why given<br/>
The ancestral fear and tendency to flee,<br/>
And why in short do all the rest of traits<br/>
Engender from the very start of life<br/>
In the members and mentality, if not<br/>
Because one certain power of mind that came<br/>
From its own seed and breed waxes the same<br/>
Along with all the body? But were mind<br/>
Immortal, were it wont to change its bodies,<br/>
How topsy-turvy would earth's creatures act!<br/>
The Hyrcan hound would flee the onset oft<br/>
Of antlered stag, the scurrying hawk would quake<br/>
Along the winds of air at the coming dove,<br/>
And men would dote, and savage beasts be wise;<br/>
For false the reasoning of those that say<br/>
Immortal mind is changed by change of body&mdash;<br/>
For what is changed dissolves, and therefore dies.<br/>
For parts are re-disposed and leave their order;<br/>
Wherefore they must be also capable<br/>
Of dissolution through the frame at last,<br/>
That they along with body perish all.<br/>
But should some say that always souls of men<br/>
Go into human bodies, I will ask:<br/>
How can a wise become a dullard soul?<br/>
And why is never a child's a prudent soul?<br/>
And the mare's filly why not trained so well<br/>
As sturdy strength of steed? We may be sure<br/>
They'll take their refuge in the thought that mind<br/>
Becomes a weakling in a weakling frame.<br/>
Yet be this so, 'tis needful to confess<br/>
The soul but mortal, since, so altered now<br/>
Throughout the frame, it loses the life and sense<br/>
It had before. Or how can mind wax strong<br/>
Coequally with body and attain<br/>
The craved flower of life, unless it be<br/>
The body's colleague in its origins?<br/>
Or what's the purport of its going forth<br/>
From aged limbs?&mdash;fears it, perhaps, to stay,<br/>
Pent in a crumbled body? Or lest its house,<br/>
Outworn by venerable length of days,<br/>
May topple down upon it? But indeed<br/>
For an immortal perils are there none.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Again, at parturitions of the wild<br/>
And at the rites of Love, that souls should stand<br/>
Ready hard by seems ludicrous enough&mdash;<br/>
Immortals waiting for their mortal limbs<br/>
In numbers innumerable, contending madly<br/>
Which shall be first and chief to enter in!&mdash;<br/>
Unless perchance among the souls there be<br/>
Such treaties stablished that the first to come<br/>
Flying along, shall enter in the first,<br/>
And that they make no rivalries of strength!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Again, in ether can't exist a tree,<br/>
Nor clouds in ocean deeps, nor in the fields<br/>
Can fishes live, nor blood in timber be,<br/>
Nor sap in boulders: fixed and arranged<br/>
Where everything may grow and have its place.<br/>
Thus nature of mind cannot arise alone<br/>
Without the body, nor exist afar<br/>
From thews and blood. But if 'twere possible,<br/>
Much rather might this very power of mind<br/>
Be in the head, the shoulders or the heels,<br/>
And, born in any part soever, yet<br/>
In the same man, in the same vessel abide.<br/>
But since within this body even of ours<br/>
Stands fixed and appears arranged sure<br/>
Where soul and mind can each exist and grow,<br/>
Deny we must the more that they can have<br/>
Duration and birth, wholly outside the frame.<br/>
For, verily, the mortal to conjoin<br/>
With the eternal, and to feign they feel<br/>
Together, and can function each with each,<br/>
Is but to dote: for what can be conceived<br/>
Of more unlike, discrepant, ill-assorted,<br/>
Than something mortal in a union joined<br/>
With an immortal and a secular<br/>
To bear the outrageous tempests?<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, again,<br/>
Whatever abides eternal must indeed<br/>
Either repel all strokes, because 'tis made<br/>
Of solid body, and permit no entrance<br/>
Of aught with power to sunder from within<br/>
The parts compact&mdash;as are those seeds of stuff<br/>
Whose nature we've exhibited before;<br/>
Or else be able to endure through time<br/>
For this: because they are from blows exempt,<br/>
As is the void, the which abides untouched,<br/>
Unsmit by any stroke; or else because<br/>
There is no room around, whereto things can,<br/>
As 'twere, depart in dissolution all,&mdash;<br/>
Even as the sum of sums eternal is,<br/>
Without or place beyond whereto things may<br/>
Asunder fly, or bodies which can smite,<br/>
And thus dissolve them by the blows of might.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But if perchance the soul's to be adjudged<br/>
Immortal, mainly on ground 'tis kept secure<br/>
In vital forces&mdash;either because there come<br/>
Never at all things hostile to its weal,<br/>
Or else because what come somehow retire,<br/>
Repelled or ere we feel the harm they work,<br/>
</p>
<p>
For, lo, besides that, when the frame's diseased,<br/>
Soul sickens too, there cometh, many a time,<br/>
That which torments it with the things to be,<br/>
Keeps it in dread, and wearies it with cares;<br/>
And even when evil acts are of the past,<br/>
Still gnaw the old transgressions bitterly.<br/>
Add, too, that frenzy, peculiar to the mind,<br/>
And that oblivion of the things that were;<br/>
Add its submergence in the murky waves<br/>
Of drowse and torpor.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore death to us<br/>
Is nothing, nor concerns us in the least,<br/>
Since nature of mind is mortal evermore.<br/>
And just as in the ages gone before<br/>
We felt no touch of ill, when all sides round<br/>
To battle came the Carthaginian host,<br/>
And the times, shaken by tumultuous war,<br/>
Under the aery coasts of arching heaven<br/>
Shuddered and trembled, and all humankind<br/>
Doubted to which the empery should fall<br/>
By land and sea, thus when we are no more,<br/>
When comes that sundering of our body and soul<br/>
Through which we're fashioned to a single state,<br/>
Verily naught to us, us then no more,<br/>
Can come to pass, naught move our senses then&mdash;<br/>
No, not if earth confounded were with sea,<br/>
And sea with heaven. But if indeed do feel<br/>
The nature of mind and energy of soul,<br/>
After their severance from this body of ours,<br/>
Yet nothing 'tis to us who in the bonds<br/>
And wedlock of the soul and body live,<br/>
Through which we're fashioned to a single state.<br/>
And, even if time collected after death<br/>
The matter of our frames and set it all<br/>
Again in place as now, and if again<br/>
To us the light of life were given, O yet<br/>
That process too would not concern us aught,<br/>
When once the self-succession of our sense<br/>
Has been asunder broken. And now and here,<br/>
Little enough we're busied with the selves<br/>
We were aforetime, nor, concerning them,<br/>
Suffer a sore distress. For shouldst thou gaze<br/>
Backwards across all yesterdays of time<br/>
The immeasurable, thinking how manifold<br/>
The motions of matter are, then couldst thou well<br/>
Credit this too: often these very seeds<br/>
(From which we are to-day) of old were set<br/>
In the same order as they are to-day&mdash;<br/>
Yet this we can't to consciousness recall<br/>
Through the remembering mind. For there hath been<br/>
An interposed pause of life, and wide<br/>
Have all the motions wandered everywhere<br/>
From these our senses. For if woe and ail<br/>
Perchance are toward, then the man to whom<br/>
The bane can happen must himself be there<br/>
At that same time. But death precludeth this,<br/>
Forbidding life to him on whom might crowd<br/>
Such irk and care; and granted 'tis to know:<br/>
Nothing for us there is to dread in death,<br/>
No wretchedness for him who is no more,<br/>
The same estate as if ne'er born before,<br/>
When death immortal hath ta'en the mortal life.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Hence, where thou seest a man to grieve because<br/>
When dead he rots with body laid away,<br/>
Or perishes in flames or jaws of beasts,<br/>
Know well: he rings not true, and that beneath<br/>
Still works an unseen sting upon his heart,<br/>
However he deny that he believes.<br/>
His shall be aught of feeling after death.<br/>
For he, I fancy, grants not what he says,<br/>
Nor what that presupposes, and he fails<br/>
To pluck himself with all his roots from life<br/>
And cast that self away, quite unawares<br/>
Feigning that some remainder's left behind.<br/>
For when in life one pictures to oneself<br/>
His body dead by beasts and vultures torn,<br/>
He pities his state, dividing not himself<br/>
Therefrom, removing not the self enough<br/>
From the body flung away, imagining<br/>
Himself that body, and projecting there<br/>
His own sense, as he stands beside it: hence<br/>
He grieves that he is mortal born, nor marks<br/>
That in true death there is no second self<br/>
Alive and able to sorrow for self destroyed,<br/>
Or stand lamenting that the self lies there<br/>
Mangled or burning. For if it an evil is<br/>
Dead to be jerked about by jaw and fang<br/>
Of the wild brutes, I see not why 'twere not<br/>
Bitter to lie on fires and roast in flames,<br/>
Or suffocate in honey, and, reclined<br/>
On the smooth oblong of an icy slab,<br/>
Grow stiff in cold, or sink with load of earth<br/>
Down-crushing from above.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thee now no more<br/>
The joyful house and best of wives shall welcome,<br/>
Nor little sons run up to snatch their kisses<br/>
And touch with silent happiness thy heart.<br/>
Thou shalt not speed in undertakings more,<br/>
Nor be the warder of thine own no more.<br/>
Poor wretch," they say, "one hostile hour hath ta'en<br/>
Wretchedly from thee all life's many guerdons,"<br/>
But add not, "yet no longer unto thee<br/>
Remains a remnant of desire for them"<br/>
If this they only well perceived with mind<br/>
And followed up with maxims, they would free<br/>
Their state of man from anguish and from fear.<br/>
"O even as here thou art, aslumber in death,<br/>
So shalt thou slumber down the rest of time,<br/>
Released from every harrying pang. But we,<br/>
We have bewept thee with insatiate woe,<br/>
Standing beside whilst on the awful pyre<br/>
Thou wert made ashes; and no day shall take<br/>
For us the eternal sorrow from the breast."<br/>
But ask the mourner what's the bitterness<br/>
That man should waste in an eternal grief,<br/>
If, after all, the thing's but sleep and rest?<br/>
For when the soul and frame together are sunk<br/>
In slumber, no one then demands his self<br/>
Or being. Well, this sleep may be forever,<br/>
Without desire of any selfhood more,<br/>
For all it matters unto us asleep.<br/>
Yet not at all do those primordial germs<br/>
Roam round our members, at that time, afar<br/>
From their own motions that produce our senses&mdash;<br/>
Since, when he's startled from his sleep, a man<br/>
Collects his senses. Death is, then, to us<br/>
Much less&mdash;if there can be a less than that<br/>
Which is itself a nothing: for there comes<br/>
Hard upon death a scattering more great<br/>
Of the throng of matter, and no man wakes up<br/>
On whom once falls the icy pause of life.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This too, O often from the soul men say,<br/>
Along their couches holding of the cups,<br/>
With faces shaded by fresh wreaths awry:<br/>
"Brief is this fruit of joy to paltry man,<br/>
Soon, soon departed, and thereafter, no,<br/>
It may not be recalled."&mdash;As if, forsooth,<br/>
It were their prime of evils in great death<br/>
To parch, poor tongues, with thirst and arid drought,<br/>
Or chafe for any lack.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more, if Nature<br/>
Should of a sudden send a voice abroad,<br/>
And her own self inveigh against us so:<br/>
"Mortal, what hast thou of such grave concern<br/>
That thou indulgest in too sickly plaints?<br/>
Why this bemoaning and beweeping death?<br/>
For if thy life aforetime and behind<br/>
To thee was grateful, and not all thy good<br/>
Was heaped as in sieve to flow away<br/>
And perish unavailingly, why not,<br/>
Even like a banqueter, depart the halls,<br/>
Laden with life? why not with mind content<br/>
Take now, thou fool, thy unafflicted rest?<br/>
But if whatever thou enjoyed hath been<br/>
Lavished and lost, and life is now offence,<br/>
Why seekest more to add&mdash;which in its turn<br/>
Will perish foully and fall out in vain?<br/>
O why not rather make an end of life,<br/>
Of labour? For all I may devise or find<br/>
To pleasure thee is nothing: all things are<br/>
The same forever. Though not yet thy body<br/>
Wrinkles with years, nor yet the frame exhausts<br/>
Outworn, still things abide the same, even if<br/>
Thou goest on to conquer all of time<br/>
With length of days, yea, if thou never diest"&mdash;<br/>
What were our answer, but that Nature here<br/>
Urges just suit and in her words lays down<br/>
True cause of action? Yet should one complain,<br/>
Riper in years and elder, and lament,<br/>
Poor devil, his death more sorely than is fit,<br/>
Then would she not, with greater right, on him<br/>
Cry out, inveighing with a voice more shrill:<br/>
"Off with thy tears, and choke thy whines, buffoon!<br/>
Thou wrinklest&mdash;after thou hast had the sum<br/>
Of the guerdons of life; yet, since thou cravest ever<br/>
What's not at hand, contemning present good,<br/>
That life has slipped away, unperfected<br/>
And unavailing unto thee. And now,<br/>
Or ere thou guessed it, death beside thy head<br/>
Stands&mdash;and before thou canst be going home<br/>
Sated and laden with the goodly feast.<br/>
But now yield all that's alien to thine age,&mdash;<br/>
Up, with good grace! make room for sons: thou must."<br/>
Justly, I fancy, would she reason thus,<br/>
Justly inveigh and gird: since ever the old<br/>
Outcrowded by the new gives way, and ever<br/>
The one thing from the others is repaired.<br/>
Nor no man is consigned to the abyss<br/>
Of Tartarus, the black. For stuff must be,<br/>
That thus the after-generations grow,&mdash;<br/>
Though these, their life completed, follow thee;<br/>
And thus like thee are generations all&mdash;<br/>
Already fallen, or some time to fall.<br/>
So one thing from another rises ever;<br/>
And in fee-simple life is given to none,<br/>
But unto all mere usufruct.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look back:<br/>
Nothing to us was all fore-passed eld<br/>
Of time the eternal, ere we had a birth.<br/>
And Nature holds this like a mirror up<br/>
Of time-to-be when we are dead and gone.<br/>
And what is there so horrible appears?<br/>
Now what is there so sad about it all?<br/>
Is't not serener far than any sleep?<br/>
</p>
<p>
And, verily, those tortures said to be<br/>
In Acheron, the deep, they all are ours<br/>
Here in this life. No Tantalus, benumbed<br/>
With baseless terror, as the fables tell,<br/>
Fears the huge boulder hanging in the air:<br/>
But, rather, in life an empty dread of Gods<br/>
Urges mortality, and each one fears<br/>
Such fall of fortune as may chance to him.<br/>
Nor eat the vultures into Tityus<br/>
Prostrate in Acheron, nor can they find,<br/>
Forsooth, throughout eternal ages, aught<br/>
To pry around for in that mighty breast.<br/>
However hugely he extend his bulk&mdash;<br/>
Who hath for outspread limbs not acres nine,<br/>
But the whole earth&mdash;he shall not able be<br/>
To bear eternal pain nor furnish food<br/>
From his own frame forever. But for us<br/>
A Tityus is he whom vultures rend<br/>
Prostrate in love, whom anxious anguish eats,<br/>
Whom troubles of any unappeased desires<br/>
Asunder rip. We have before our eyes<br/>
Here in this life also a Sisyphus<br/>
In him who seeketh of the populace<br/>
The rods, the axes fell, and evermore<br/>
Retires a beaten and a gloomy man.<br/>
For to seek after power&mdash;an empty name,<br/>
Nor given at all&mdash;and ever in the search<br/>
To endure a world of toil, O this it is<br/>
To shove with shoulder up the hill a stone<br/>
Which yet comes rolling back from off the top,<br/>
And headlong makes for levels of the plain.<br/>
Then to be always feeding an ingrate mind,<br/>
Filling with good things, satisfying never&mdash;<br/>
As do the seasons of the year for us,<br/>
When they return and bring their progenies<br/>
And varied charms, and we are never filled<br/>
With the fruits of life&mdash;O this, I fancy, 'tis<br/>
To pour, like those young virgins in the tale,<br/>
Waters into a sieve, unfilled forever.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Cerberus and Furies, and that Lack of Light<br/>
Tartarus, out-belching from his mouth the surge<br/>
Of horrible heat&mdash;the which are nowhere, nor<br/>
Indeed can be: but in this life is fear<br/>
Of retributions just and expiations<br/>
For evil acts: the dungeon and the leap<br/>
From that dread rock of infamy, the stripes,<br/>
The executioners, the oaken rack,<br/>
The iron plates, bitumen, and the torch.<br/>
And even though these are absent, yet the mind,<br/>
With a fore-fearing conscience, plies its goads<br/>
And burns beneath the lash, nor sees meanwhile<br/>
What terminus of ills, what end of pine<br/>
Can ever be, and feareth lest the same<br/>
But grow more heavy after death. Of truth,<br/>
The life of fools is Acheron on earth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This also to thy very self sometimes<br/>
Repeat thou mayst: "Lo, even good Ancus left<br/>
The sunshine with his eyes, in divers things<br/>
A better man than thou, O worthless hind;<br/>
And many other kings and lords of rule<br/>
Thereafter have gone under, once who swayed<br/>
O'er mighty peoples. And he also, he&mdash;<br/>
Who whilom paved a highway down the sea,<br/>
And gave his legionaries thoroughfare<br/>
Along the deep, and taught them how to cross<br/>
The pools of brine afoot, and did contemn,<br/>
Trampling upon it with his cavalry,<br/>
The bellowings of ocean&mdash;poured his soul<br/>
From dying body, as his light was ta'en.<br/>
And Scipio's son, the thunderbolt of war,<br/>
Horror of Carthage, gave his bones to earth,<br/>
Like to the lowliest villein in the house.<br/>
Add finders-out of sciences and arts;<br/>
Add comrades of the Heliconian dames,<br/>
Among whom Homer, sceptered o'er them all,<br/>
Now lies in slumber sunken with the rest.<br/>
Then, too, Democritus, when ripened eld<br/>
Admonished him his memory waned away,<br/>
Of own accord offered his head to death.<br/>
Even Epicurus went, his light of life<br/>
Run out, the man in genius who o'er-topped<br/>
The human race, extinguishing all others,<br/>
As sun, in ether arisen, all the stars.<br/>
Wilt thou, then, dally, thou complain to go?&mdash;<br/>
For whom already life's as good as dead,<br/>
Whilst yet thou livest and lookest?&mdash;who in sleep<br/>
Wastest thy life&mdash;time's major part, and snorest<br/>
Even when awake, and ceasest not to see<br/>
The stuff of dreams, and bearest a mind beset<br/>
By baseless terror, nor discoverest oft<br/>
What's wrong with thee, when, like a sotted wretch,<br/>
Thou'rt jostled along by many crowding cares,<br/>
And wanderest reeling round, with mind aswim."<br/>
</p>
<p>
If men, in that same way as on the mind<br/>
They feel the load that wearies with its weight,<br/>
Could also know the causes whence it comes,<br/>
And why so great the heap of ill on heart,<br/>
O not in this sort would they live their life,<br/>
As now so much we see them, knowing not<br/>
What 'tis they want, and seeking ever and ever<br/>
A change of place, as if to drop the burden.<br/>
The man who sickens of his home goes out,<br/>
Forth from his splendid halls, and straight&mdash;returns,<br/>
Feeling i'faith no better off abroad.<br/>
He races, driving his Gallic ponies along,<br/>
Down to his villa, madly,&mdash;as in haste<br/>
To hurry help to a house afire.&mdash;At once<br/>
He yawns, as soon as foot has touched the threshold,<br/>
Or drowsily goes off in sleep and seeks<br/>
Forgetfulness, or maybe bustles about<br/>
And makes for town again. In such a way<br/>
Each human flees himself&mdash;a self in sooth,<br/>
As happens, he by no means can escape;<br/>
And willy-nilly he cleaves to it and loathes,<br/>
Sick, sick, and guessing not the cause of ail.<br/>
Yet should he see but that, O chiefly then,<br/>
Leaving all else, he'd study to divine<br/>
The nature of things, since here is in debate<br/>
Eternal time and not the single hour,<br/>
Mortal's estate in whatsoever remains<br/>
After great death.<br/>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And too, when all is said,<br/>
What evil lust of life is this so great<br/>
Subdues us to live, so dreadfully distraught<br/>
In perils and alarms? one fixed end<br/>
Of life abideth for mortality;<br/>
Death's not to shun, and we must go to meet.<br/>
Besides we're busied with the same devices,<br/>
Ever and ever, and we are at them ever,<br/>
And there's no new delight that may be forged<br/>
By living on. But whilst the thing we long for<br/>
Is lacking, that seems good above all else;<br/>
Thereafter, when we've touched it, something else<br/>
We long for; ever one equal thirst of life<br/>
Grips us agape. And doubtful 'tis what fortune<br/>
The future times may carry, or what be<br/>
That chance may bring, or what the issue next<br/>
Awaiting us. Nor by prolonging life<br/>
Take we the least away from death's own time,<br/>
Nor can we pluck one moment off, whereby<br/>
To minish the aeons of our state of death.<br/>
Therefore, O man, by living on, fulfil<br/>
As many generations as thou may:<br/>
Eternal death shall there be waiting still;<br/>
And he who died with light of yesterday<br/>
Shall be no briefer time in death's No-more<br/>
Than he who perished months or years before.<br/>

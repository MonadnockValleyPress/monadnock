<h1>The Sun Rising</h1>
<h2>by John Donne</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Busy old fool, unruly Sun,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why dost thou thus,<br/>
Through windows, and through curtains, call on us?<br/>
Must to thy motions lovers' seasons run?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late school-boys and sour prentices,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Go tell court-huntsmen that the king will ride,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Call country ants to harvest offices;<br/>
Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,<br/>
Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy beams so reverend, and strong<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why shouldst thou think?<br/>
I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink,<br/>
But that I would not lose her sight so long.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If her eyes have not blinded thine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, and to-morrow late tell me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether both th' Indias of spice and mine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be where thou left'st them, or lie here with me.<br/>
Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday,<br/>
And thou shalt hear, "All here in one bed lay."
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's all states, and all princes I;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing else is;<br/>
Princes do but play us; compared to this,<br/>
All honour's mimic, all wealth alchemy.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou, Sun, art half as happy as we,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that the world's contracted thus;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To warm the world, that's done in warming us.<br/>
Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere;<br/>
This bed thy center is, these walls thy sphere.

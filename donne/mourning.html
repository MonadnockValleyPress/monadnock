<h1>A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning</h1>
<h2>by John Donne</h2>
<p>
As virtuous men pass mildly away,<br/>
And whisper to their souls to go,<br/>
Whilst some of their sad friends do say,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now his breath goes," and some say, "No."
</p>
<p>
So let us melt, and make no noise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;<br/>
'Twere profanation of our joys<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell the laity our love.
</p>
<p>
Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Men reckon what it did, and meant;<br/>
But trepidation of the spheres,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though greater far, is innocent.
</p>
<p>
Dull sublunary lovers' love<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Whose soul is sense&mdash;cannot admit<br/>
Of absence, 'cause it doth remove<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing which elemented it.
</p>
<p>
But we by a love so much refined,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That ourselves know not what it is,<br/>
Inter-assur√®d of the mind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Care less, eyes, lips and hands to miss.
</p>
<p>
Our two souls therefore, which are one,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I must go, endure not yet<br/>
A breach, but an expansion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like gold to aery thinness beat.
</p>
<p>
If they be two, they are two so<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As stiff twin compasses are two;<br/>
Thy soul, the fix'd foot, makes no show<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To move, but doth, if th' other do.
</p>
<p>
And though it in the centre sit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, when the other far doth roam,<br/>
It leans, and hearkens after it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And grows erect, as that comes home.
</p>
<p>
Such wilt thou be to me, who must,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like th' other foot, obliquely run;<br/>
Thy firmness makes my circle just<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And makes me end where I begun.

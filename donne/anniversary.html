<h1>The Anniversary</h1>
<h2>by John Donne</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All kings, and all their favourites,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All glory of honours, beauties, wits,<br/>
The sun it self, which makes time, as they pass,<br/>
Is elder by a year now than it was<br/>
When thou and I first one another saw.<br/>
All other things to their destruction draw,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Only our love hath no decay;<br/>
This no to-morrow hath, nor yesterday;<br/>
Running it never runs from us away,<br/>
But truly keeps his first, last, everlasting day.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Two graves must hide thine and my corse;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If one might, death were no divorce.<br/>
Alas! as well as other princes, we<br/>
&mdash;Who prince enough in one another be&mdash;<br/>
Must leave at last in death these eyes and ears,<br/>
Oft fed with true oaths, and with sweet salt tears;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But souls where nothing dwells but love<br/>
&mdash;All other thoughts being inmates&mdash;then shall prove<br/>
This or a love increas√®d there above,<br/>
When bodies to their graves, souls from their graves remove.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then we shall be throughly blest;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But now no more than all the rest.<br/>
Here upon earth we're kings, and none but we<br/>
Can be such kings, nor of such subjects be.<br/>
Who is so safe as we? where none can do<br/>
Treason to us, except one of us two.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;True and false fears let us refrain,<br/>
Let us love nobly, and live, and add again<br/>
Years and years unto years, till we attain<br/>
To write threescore; this is the second of our reign.

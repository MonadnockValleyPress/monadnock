<h1>Self-Love</h1>
<h2>by John Donne</h2>
<p>
He that cannot choose but love,<br/>
And strives against it still,<br/>
Never shall my fancy move,<br/>
For he loves against his will;<br/>
Nor he which is all his own,<br/>
And cannot pleasure choose;<br/>
When I am caught he can be gone,<br/>
And when he list refuse;<br/>
Nor he that loves none but fair,<br/>
For such by all are sought;<br/>
Nor he that can for foul ones care,<br/>
For his judgement then is nought;<br/>
Nor he that hath wit, for he<br/>
Will make me his jest or slave;<br/>
Nor a fool when others &mdash;<br/>
He can neither &mdash;<br/>
Nor he that still his mistress prays,<br/>
For she is thrall'd therefore;<br/>
Nor he that pays, not, for he says<br/>
Within, she's worth no more.<br/>
Is there then no kind of men<br/>
Whom I may freely prove?<br/>
I will vent that humour then<br/>
In mine own self-love.

<h1>A Lecture upon the Shadow</h1>
<h2>by John Donne</h2>
<p>
Stand still, and I will read to thee<br/>
A lecture, Love, in Love's philosophy.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three hours that we have spent,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking here, two shadows went<br/>
Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd.<br/>
But, now the sun is just above our head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do those shadows tread,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd.<br/>
So whilst our infant loves did grow,<br/>
Disguises did, and shadows, flow<br/>
From us and our cares; but now 'tis not so.
</p>
<p>
That love hath not attain'd the highest degree,<br/>
Which is still diligent lest others see.
</p>
<p>
Except our loves at this noon stay,<br/>
We shall new shadows make the other way.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first were made to blind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others, these which come behind<br/>
Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes.<br/>
If our loves faint, and westwardly decline,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me thou, falsely, thine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I to thee mine actions shall disguise.<br/>
The morning shadows wear away,<br/>
But these grow longer all the day;<br/>
But O! love's day is short, if love decay.
</p>
<p>
Love is a growing, or full constant light,<br/>
And his short minute, after noon, is night.

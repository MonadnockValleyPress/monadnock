<h1>The Triple Fool</h1>
<h2>by John Donne</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am two fools, I know,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For loving, and for saying so<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In whining poetry;<br/>
But where's that wise man, that would not be I,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she would not deny?<br/>
Then as th' earth's inward narrow crooked lanes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do purge sea water's fretful salt away,<br/>
I thought, if I could draw my pains<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through rhyme's vexation, I should them allay.<br/>
Grief brought to numbers cannot be so fierce,<br/>
For he tames it, that fetters it in verse.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I have done so,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some man, his art and voice to show,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth set and sing my pain;<br/>
And, by delighting many, frees again<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grief, which verse did restrain.<br/>
To love and grief tribute of verse belongs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But not of such as pleases when 'tis read.<br/>
Both are increasèd by such songs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For both their triumphs so are publishèd,<br/>
And I, which was two fools, do so grow three.<br/>
Who are a little wise, the best fools be.

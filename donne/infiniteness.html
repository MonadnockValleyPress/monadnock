<h1>Lovers' Infiniteness</h1>
<h2>by John Donne</h2>
<p>
If yet I have not all thy love,<br/>
Dear, I shall never have it all;<br/>
I cannot breathe one other sigh, to move,<br/>
Nor can intreat one other tear to fall;<br/>
And all my treasure, which should purchase thee,<br/>
Sighs, tears, and oaths, and letters I have spent;<br/>
Yet no more can be due to me,<br/>
Than at the bargain made was meant.<br/>
If then thy gift of love were partial,<br/>
That some to me, some should to others fall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear, I shall never have thee all.
</p>
<p>
Or if then thou gavest me all,<br/>
All was but all, which thou hadst then;<br/>
But if in thy heart since there be or shall<br/>
New love created be by other men,<br/>
Which have their stocks entire, and can in tears,<br/>
In sighs, in oaths, and letters, outbid me,<br/>
This new love may beget new fears,<br/>
For this love was not vow'd by thee.<br/>
And yet it was, thy gift being general;<br/>
The ground, thy heart, is mine; what ever shall<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grow there, dear, I should have it all.
</p>
<p>
Yet I would not have all yet.<br/>
He that hath all can have no more;<br/>
And since my love doth every day admit<br/>
New growth, thou shouldst have new rewards in store;<br/>
Thou canst not every day give me thy heart,<br/>
If thou canst give it, then thou never gavest it;<br/>
Love's riddles are, that though thy heart depart,<br/>
It stays at home, and thou with losing savest it;<br/>
But we will have a way more liberal,<br/>
Than changing hearts, to join them; so we shall<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be one, and one another's all.

<h1>The Bait</h1>
<h2>by John Donne</h2>
<p>
I'll tell thee now (dear love) what thou shalt do<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To anger destiny, as she doth us;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How I shall stay, though she eloign me thus,<br/>
And how posterity shall know it too;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How thine may out-endure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sibyl's glory, and obscure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her who from Pindar could allure,<br/>
And her, through whose help Lucan is not lame,<br/>
And her, whose book (they say) Homer did find, and name.
</p>
<p>
Study our manuscripts, those myriads<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of letters, which have past 'twixt thee and me;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thence write our annals, and in them will be<br/>
To all whom love's subliming fire invades,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule and example found;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the faith of any ground<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No schismatic will dare to wound,<br/>
That sees, how Love this grace to us affords,<br/>
To make, to keep, to use, to be these his records.
</p>
<p>
This book, as long-lived as the elements,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or as the world's form, this all-grav√®d tome<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In cypher writ, or new made idiom;<br/>
We for Love's clergy only are instruments;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this book is made thus,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should again the ravenous<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vandals and Goths invade us,<br/>
Learning were safe; in this our universe,<br/>
Schools might learn sciences, spheres music, angels verse.
</p>
<p>
Here Love's divines&mdash;since all divinity<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is love or wonder&mdash;may find all they seek,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether abstract spiritual love they like,<br/>
Their souls exhaled with what they do not see;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, loth so to amuse<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faith's infirmity, they choose<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something which they may see and use;<br/>
For, though mind be the heaven, where love doth sit,<br/>
Beauty a convenient type may be to figure it.
</p>
<p>
Here more than in their books may lawyers find,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Both by what titles mistresses are ours,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And how prerogative these states devours,<br/>
Transferr'd from Love himself, to womankind;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, though from heart and eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They exact great subsidies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forsake him who on them relies;<br/>
And for the cause, honour, or conscience give;<br/>
Chimeras vain as they or their prerogative.
</p>
<p>
Here statesmen&mdash;or of them, they which can read&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May of their occupation find the grounds;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love, and their art, alike it deadly wounds,<br/>
If to consider what 'tis, one proceed.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both they do excel<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who the present govern well,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose weakness none doth, or dares tell;<br/>
In this thy book, such will there something see,<br/>
As in the Bible some can find out alchemy.
</p>
<p>
Thus vent thy thoughts; abroad I'll study thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As he removes far off, that great heights takes;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How great love is, presence best trial makes,<br/>
But absence tries how long this love will be;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take a latitude<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun, or stars, are fitliest view'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At their brightest, but to conclude<br/>
Of longitudes, what other way have we,<br/>
But to mark when and where the dark eclipses be?

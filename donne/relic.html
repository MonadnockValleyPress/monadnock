<h1>The Relic</h1>
<h2>by John Donne</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEN my grave is broke up again<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some second guest to entertain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;For graves have learn'd that woman-head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be to more than one a bed&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he that digs it, spies<br/>
A bracelet of bright hair about the bone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will he not let us alone,<br/>
And think that there a loving couple lies,<br/>
Who thought that this device might be some way<br/>
To make their souls at the last busy day<br/>
Meet at this grave, and make a little stay?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If this fall in a time, or land,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where mass-devotion doth command,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he that digs us up will bring<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Us to the bishop or the king,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make us relics; then<br/>
Thou shalt be a Mary Magdalen, and I<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A something else thereby;<br/>
All women shall adore us, and some men.<br/>
And, since at such time miracles are sought,<br/>
I would have that age by this paper taught<br/>
What miracles we harmless lovers wrought.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;First we loved well and faithfully,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet knew not what we loved, nor why;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Difference of sex we never knew,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than guardian angels do;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming and going we<br/>
Perchance might kiss, but not between those meals;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hands ne'er touch'd the seals,<br/>
Which nature, injured by late law, sets free.<br/>
These miracles we did; but now alas!<br/>
All measure, and all language, I should pass,<br/>
Should I tell what a miracle she was.

<h1>The Broken Heart</h1>
<h2>by John Donne</h2>
<p>
He is stark mad, whoever says,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he hath been in love an hour,<br/>
Yet not that love so soon decays,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But that it can ten in less space devour;<br/>
Who will believe me, if I swear<br/>
That I have had the plague a year?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would not laugh at me, if I should say<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a flash of powder burn a day?
</p>
<p>
Ah, what a trifle is a heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If once into love's hands it come!<br/>
All other griefs allow a part<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To other griefs, and ask themselves but some;<br/>
They come to us, but us love draws;<br/>
He swallows us and never chaws;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By him, as by chain'd shot, whole ranks do die;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the tyrant pike, our hearts the fry.
</p>
<p>
If 'twere not so, what did become<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my heart when I first saw thee?<br/>
I brought a heart into the room,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the room I carried none with me.<br/>
If it had gone to thee, I know<br/>
Mine would have taught thine heart to show<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More pity unto me; but Love, alas!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At one first blow did shiver it as glass.
</p>
<p>
Yet nothing can to nothing fall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor any place be empty quite;<br/>
Therefore I think my breast hath all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those pieces still, though they be not unite;<br/>
And now, as broken glasses show<br/>
A hundred lesser faces, so<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My rags of heart can like, wish, and adore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But after one such love, can love no more.

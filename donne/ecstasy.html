<h1>The Ecstasy</h1>
<h2>by John Donne</h2>
<p>
Where, like a pillow on a bed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A pregnant bank swell'd up, to rest<br>
The violet's reclining head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat we two, one another's best.
</p>
<p>
Our hands were firmly cemented<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By a fast balm, which thence did spring;<br>
Our eye-beams twisted, and did thread<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our eyes upon one double string.
</p>
<p>
So to engraft our hands, as yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was all the means to make us one;<br>
And pictures in our eyes to get<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was all our propagation.
</p>
<p>
As, 'twixt two equal armies, Fate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspends uncertain victory,<br>
Our souls&mdash;which to advance their state,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were gone out&mdash;hung 'twixt her and me.
</p>
<p>
And whilst our souls negotiate there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We like sepulchral statues lay;<br>
All day, the same our postures were,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And we said nothing, all the day.
</p>
<p>
If any, so by love refined,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he soul's language understood,<br>
And by good love were grown all mind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within convenient distance stood,
</p>
<p>
He&mdash;though he knew not which soul spake,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because both meant, both spake the same&mdash;<br>
Might thence a new concoction take,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And part far purer than he came.
</p>
<p>
This ecstasy doth unperplex<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(We said) and tell us what we love;<br>
We see by this, it was not sex;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We see, we saw not, what did move:
</p>
<p>
But as all several souls contain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixture of things they know not what,<br>
Love these mix'd souls doth mix again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And makes both one, each this, and that.
</p>
<p>
A single violet transplant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength, the colour, and the size&mdash;<br>
All which before was poor and scant&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Redoubles still, and multiplies.
</p>
<p>
When love with one another so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Interanimates two souls,<br>
That abler soul, which thence doth flow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Defects of loneliness controls.
</p>
<p>
We then, who are this new soul, know,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what we are composed, and made,<br>
For th' atomies of which we grow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are souls, whom no change can invade.
</p>
<p>
But, O alas! so long, so far,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bodies why do we forbear?<br>
They are ours, though not we; we are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' intelligences, they the spheres.
</p>
<p>
We owe them thanks, because they thus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did us, to us, at first convey,<br>
Yielded their senses' force to us,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor are dross to us, but allay.
</p>
<p>
On man heaven's influence works not so,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But that it first imprints the air;<br>
For soul into the soul may flow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it to body first repair.
</p>
<p>
As our blood labours to beget<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirits, as like souls as it can;<br>
Because such fingers need to knit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That subtle knot, which makes us man;
</p>
<p>
So must pure lovers' souls descend<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To affections, and to faculties,<br>
Which sense may reach and apprehend,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Else a great prince in prison lies.
</p>
<p>
To our bodies turn we then, that so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Weak men on love reveal'd may look;<br>
Love's mysteries in souls do grow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But yet the body is his book.
</p>
<p>
And if some lover, such as we,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have heard this dialogue of one,<br>
Let him still mark us, he shall see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Small change when we're to bodies gone.

<h1>The Good-Morrow</h1>
<h2>by John Donne</h2>
<p>
I wonder by my troth, what thou and I<br/>
Did, till we loved? were we not wean'd till then?<br/>
But suck'd on country pleasures, childishly?<br/>
Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers' den?<br/>
'Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be;<br/>
If ever any beauty I did see,<br/>
Which I desired, and got, 'twas but a dream of thee.
</p>
<p>
And now good-morrow to our waking souls,<br/>
Which watch not one another out of fear;<br/>
For love all love of other sights controls,<br/>
And makes one little room an everywhere.<br/>
Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone;<br/>
Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown;<br/>
Let us possess one world; each hath one, and is one.
</p>
<p>
My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears,<br/>
And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;<br/>
Where can we find two better hemispheres<br/>
Without sharp north, without declining west?<br/>
Whatever dies, was not mix'd equally;<br/>
If our two loves be one, or thou and I<br/>
Love so alike that none can slacken, none can die.

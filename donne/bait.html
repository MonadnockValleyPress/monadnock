<h1>The Bait</h1>
<h2>by John Donne</h2>
<p>(This poem is a rejoinder to Christopher Marlowe's poem <a href='/marlowe/shepherd.html'>The Passionate Shepherd to His Love</a>.)</p>
<p>
Come live with me, and be my love,<br/>
And we will some new pleasures prove<br/>
Of golden sands, and crystal brooks,<br/>
With silken lines and silver hooks.
</p>
<p>
There will the river whisp'ring run<br/>
Warm'd by thy eyes, more than the sun;<br/>
And there th' enamour'd fish will stay,<br/>
Begging themselves they may betray.
</p>
<p>
When thou wilt swim in that live bath,<br/>
Each fish, which every channel hath,<br/>
Will amorously to thee swim,<br/>
Gladder to catch thee, than thou him.
</p>
<p>
If thou, to be so seen, be'st loth,<br/>
By sun or moon, thou dark'nest both,<br/>
And if myself have leave to see,<br/>
I need not their light, having thee.
</p>
<p>
Let others freeze with angling reeds,<br/>
And cut their legs with shells and weeds,<br/>
Or treacherously poor fish beset,<br/>
With strangling snare, or windowy net.
</p>
<p>
Let coarse bold hands from slimy nest<br/>
The bedded fish in banks out-wrest;<br/>
Or curious traitors, sleeve-silk flies,<br/>
Bewitch poor fishes' wand'ring eyes.
</p>
<p>
For thee, thou need'st no such deceit,<br/>
For thou thyself art thine own bait:<br/>
That fish, that is not catch'd thereby,<br/>
Alas! is wiser far than I.

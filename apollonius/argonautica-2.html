<h1>Argonautica</h1>
<h2>by Apollonius of Rhodes</h2>
<h3>Book II</h3>
<p>
Here were the oxstalls and farm of Amycus, the haughty king of the Bebrycians,
whom once a nymph, Bithynian Melie, united to Poseidon Genethlius, bare the
most arrogant of men; for even for strangers he laid down an insulting
ordinance, that none should depart till they had made trial of him in boxing;
and he had slain many of the neighbours. And at that time too he went down to
the ship and in his insolence scorned to ask them the occasion of their voyage,
and who they were, but at once spake out among them all:
</p>
<p>
“Listen, ye wanderers by sea, to what it befits you to know. It is the
rule that no stranger who comes to the Bebrycians should depart till he has
raised his hands in battle against mine. Wherefore select your bravest warrior
from the host and set him here on the spot to contend with me in boxing. But if
ye pay no heed and trample my decrees under foot, assuredly to your sorrow will
stern necessity come upon you.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake in his pride, but fierce anger seized them when they heard it,
and the challenge smote Polydeuces most of all. And quickly he stood forth his
comrades’ champion, and cried:
</p>
<p>
“Hold now, and display not to us thy brutal violence, whoever thou art;
for we will obey thy rules, as thou sayest. Willingly now do I myself undertake
to meet thee.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake outright; but the other with rolling eyes glared on him, like to
a lion struck by a javelin when hunters in the mountains are hemming him round,
and, though pressed by the throng, he reeks no more of them, but keeps his eyes
fixed, singling out that man only who struck him first and slew him not.
Hereupon the son of Tyndareus laid aside his mantle, closely-woven,
delicately-wrought, which one of the Lemnian maidens had given him as a pledge
of hospitality; and the king threw down his dark cloak of double fold with its
clasps and the knotted crook of mountain olive which he carried. Then
straightway they looked and chose close by a spot that pleased them and bade
their comrades sit upon the sand in two lines; nor were they alike to behold in
form or in stature. The one seemed to be a monstrous son of baleful Typhoeus or
of Earth herself, such as she brought forth aforetime, in her wrath against
Zeus; but the other, the son of Tyndareus, was like a star of heaven, whose
beams are fairest as it shines through the nightly sky at eventide. Such was
the son of Zeus, the bloom of the first down still on his cheeks, still with
the look of gladness in his eyes. But his might and fury waxed like a wild
beast’s; and he poised his hands to see if they were pliant as before and
were not altogether numbed by toil and rowing. But Amycus on his side made no
trial; but standing apart in silence he kept his eyes upon his foe, and his
spirit surged within him all eager to dash the life-blood from his breast. And
between them Lyeoreus, the henchman of Amycus, placed at their feet on each
side two pairs of gauntlets made of raw hide, dry, exceeding tough. And the
king addressed the hero with arrogant words:
</p>
<p>
“Whichever of these thou wilt, without casting lots, I grant thee freely,
that thou mayst not blame me hereafter. Bind them about thy hands; thou shalt
learn and tell another how skilled I am to carve the dry oxhides and to spatter
men’s cheeks with blood.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake; but the other gave back no taunt in answer, but with a light
smile readily took up the gauntlets that lay at his feet; and to him came
Castor and mighty Talaus, son of Bias, and they quickly bound the gauntlets
about his hands, often bidding him be of good courage. And to Amycus came
Aretus and Ornytus, but little they knew, poor fools, that they had bound them
for the last time on their champion, a victim of evil fate.
</p>
<p>
Now when they stood apart and were ready with their gauntlets, straightway in
front of their faces they raised their heavy hands and matched their might in
deadly strife. Hereupon the Bebrycian king even as a fierce wave of the sea
rises in a crest against a swift ship, but she by the skill of the crafty pilot
just escapes the shock when the billow is eager to break over the
bulwark—so he followed up the son of Tyndareus, trying to daunt him, and
gave him no respite. But the hero, ever unwounded, by his skill baffled the
rush of his foe, and he quickly noted the brutal play of his fists to see where
he was invincible in strength, and where inferior, and stood unceasingly and
returned blow for blow. And as when shipwrights with their hammers smite
ships’ timbers to meet the sharp clamps, fixing layer upon layer; and the
blows resound one after another; so cheeks and jaws crashed on both sides, and
a huge clattering of teeth arose, nor did they cease ever from striking their
blows until laboured gasping overcame both. And standing a little apart they
wiped from their foreheads sweat in abundance, wearily panting for breath. Then
back they rushed together again, as two bulls fight in furious rivalry for a
grazing heifer. Next Amycus rising on tiptoe, like one who slays an ox, sprung
to his full height and swung his heavy hand down upon his rival; but the hero
swerved aside from the rush, turning his head, and just received the arm on his
shoulder; and coming near and slipping his knee past the king’s, with a
rush he struck him above the ear, and broke the bones inside, and the king in
agony fell upon his knees; and the Minyan heroes shouted for joy; and his life
was poured forth all at once.
</p>
<p>
Nor were the Bebrycians reckless of their king; but all together took up rough
clubs and spears and rushed straight on Polydeuces. But in front of him stood
his comrades, their keen swords drawn from the sheath. First Castor struck upon
the head a man as he rushed at him: and it was cleft in twain and fell on each
side upon his shoulders. And Polydeuces slew huge Itymoneus and Mimas. The one,
with a sudden leap, he smote beneath the breast with his swift foot and threw
him in the dust; and as the other drew near he struck him with his right hand
above the left eyebrow, and tore away his eyelid and the eyeball was left bare.
But Oreides, insolent henchman of Amycus, wounded Talaus son of Bias in the
side, but did not slay him, but only grazing the skin the bronze sped under his
belt and touched not the flesh. Likewise Aretus with well-seasoned club smote
Iphitus, the steadfast son of Eurytus, not yet destined to an evil death;
assuredly soon was he himself to be slain by the sword of Clytius. Then
Ancaeus, the dauntless son of Lycurgus, quickly seized his huge axe, and in his
left hand holding a bear’s dark hide, plunged into the midst of the
Bebrycians with furious onset; and with him charged the sons of Aeacus, and
with them started warlike Jason. And as when amid the folds grey wolves rush
down on a winter’s day and scare countless sheep, unmarked by the
keen-scented dogs and the shepherds too, and they seek what first to attack and
carry off; often glaring around, but the sheep are just huddled together and
trample on one another; so the heroes grievously scared the arrogant
Bebrycians. And as shepherds or beekeepers smoke out a huge swarm of bees in a
rock, and they meanwhile, pent up in their hive, murmur with droning hum, till,
stupefied by the murky smoke, they fly forth far from the rock; so they stayed
steadfast no longer, but scattered themselves inland through Bebrycia,
proclaiming the death of Amycus; fools, not to perceive that another woe all
unforeseen was hard upon them. For at that hour their vineyards and villages
were being ravaged by the hostile spear of Lycus and the Mariandyni, now that
their king was gone. For they were ever at strife about the ironbearing land.
And now the foe was destroying their steadings and farms, and now the heroes
from all sides were driving off their countless sheep, and one spake among his
fellows thus:
</p>
<p>
“Bethink ye what they would have done in their cowardice if haply some
god had brought Heracles hither. Assuredly, if he had been here, no trial would
there have been of fists, I ween, but when the king drew near to proclaim his
rules, the club would have made him forget his pride and the rules to boot.
Yea, we left him uncared for on the strand and we sailed oversea; and full well
each one of us shall know our baneful folly, now that he is far away.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, but all these things had been wrought by the counsels of Zeus.
Then they remained there through the night and tended the hurts of the wounded
men, and offered sacrifice to the immortals, and made ready a mighty meal; and
sleep fell upon no man beside the bowl and the blazing sacrifice. They wreathed
their fair brows with the bay that grew by the shore, whereto their hawsers
were bound, and chanted a song to the lyre of Orpheus in sweet harmony; and the
windless shore was charmed by their song; and they celebrated the Therapnaean
son of Zeus.
</p>
<p>
But when the sun rising from far lands lighted up the dewy hills and wakened
the shepherds, then they loosed their hawsers from the stem of the baytree and
put on board all the spoil they had need to take; and with a favouring wind
they steered through the eddying Bosporus. Hereupon a wave like a steep
mountain rose aloft in front as though rushing upon them, ever upheaved above
the clouds; nor would you say that they could escape grim death, for in its
fury it hangs over the middle of the ship, like a cloud, yet it sinks away into
calm if it meets with a skilful helmsman. So they by the steering-craft of
Tiphys escaped, unhurt but sore dismayed. And on the next day they fastened the
hawsers to the coast opposite the Bithynian land.
</p>
<p>
There Phineus, son of Agenor, had his home by the sea, Phineus who above all
men endured most bitter woes because of the gift of prophecy which Leto’s
son had granted him aforetime. And he reverenced not a whit even Zeus himself,
for he foretold unerringly to men his sacred will. Wherefore Zeus sent upon him
a lingering old age, and took from his eyes the pleasant light, and suffered
him not to have joy of the dainties untold that the dwellers around ever
brought to his house, when they came to enquire the will of heaven. But on a
sudden, swooping through the clouds, the Harpies with their crooked beaks
incessantly snatched the food away from his mouth and hands. And at times not a
morsel of food was left, at others but a little, in order that he might live
and be tormented. And they poured forth over all a loathsome stench; and no one
dared not merely to carry food to his mouth but even to stand at a distance; so
foully reeked the remnants of the meal. But straightway when he heard the voice
and the tramp of the band he knew that they were the men passing by, at whose
coming Zeus’ oracle had declared to him that he should have joy of his
food. And he rose from his couch, like a lifeless dream, bowed over his staff,
and crept to the door on his withered feet, feeling the walls; and as he moved,
his limbs trembled for weakness and age; and his parched skin was caked with
dirt, and naught but the skill held his bones together. And he came forth from
the hall with wearied knees and sat on the threshold of the courtyard; and a
dark stupor covered him, and it seemed that the earth reeled round beneath his
feet, and he lay in a strengthless trance, speechless. But when they saw him
they gathered round and marvelled. And he at last drew laboured breath from the
depths of his chest and spoke among them with prophetic utterance:
</p>
<p>
“Listen, bravest of all the Hellenes, if it be truly ye, whom by a
king’s ruthless command Jason is leading on the ship Argo in quest of the
fleece. It is ye truly. Even yet my soul by its divination knows everything.
Thanks I render to thee, O king, son of Leto, plunged in bitter affliction
though I be. I beseech you by Zeus the god of suppliants, the sternest foe to
sinful men, and for the sake of Phoebus and Hera herself, under whose especial
care ye have come hither, help me, save an ill-fated man from misery, and
depart not uncaring and leaving me thus as ye see. For not only has the Fury
set her foot on my eyes and I drag on to the end a weary old age; but besides
my other woes a woe hangs over me the bitterest of all. The Harpies, swooping
down from some unseen den of destruction, ever snatch the food from my mouth.
And I have no device to aid me. But it were easier, when I long for a meal, to
escape my own thoughts than them, so swiftly do they fly through the air. But
if haply they do leave me a morsel of food it reeks of decay and the stench is
unendurable, nor could any mortal bear to draw near even for a moment, no, not
if his heart were wrought of adamant. But necessity, bitter and insatiate,
compels me to abide and abiding to put food in my cursed belly. These pests,
the oracle declares, the sons of Boreas shall restrain. And no strangers are
they that shall ward them off if indeed I am Phineus who was once renowned
among men for wealth and the gift of prophecy, and if I am the son of my father
Agenor; and, when I ruled among the Thracians, by my bridal gifts I brought
home their sister Cleopatra to be my wife.”
</p>
<p>
So spake Agenor’s son; and deep sorrow seized each of the heroes, and
especially the two sons of Boreas. And brushing away a tear they drew nigh, and
Zetes spake as follows, taking in his own the hand of the grief-worn sire:
</p>
<p>
“Unhappy one, none other of men is more wretched than thou, methinks. Why
upon thee is laid the burden of so many sorrows? Hast thou with baneful folly
sinned against the gods through thy skill in prophecy? For this are they
greatly wroth with thee? Yet our spirit is dismayed within us for all our
desire to aid thee, if indeed the god has granted this privilege to us two. For
plain to discern to men of earth are the reproofs of the immortals. And we will
never check the Harpies when they come, for all our desire, until thou hast
sworn that for this we shall not lose the favour of heaven.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake; and towards him the aged sire opened his sightless eyes, and
lifted them up and replied with these words:
</p>
<p>
“Be silent, store not up such thoughts in thy heart, my child. Let the
son of Leto be my witness, he who of his gracious will taught me the lore of
prophecy, and be witness the ill-starred doom which possesses me and this dark
cloud upon my eyes, and the gods of the underworld—and may their curse be
upon me if I die perjured thus—no wrath from heaven will fall upon you
two for your help to me.”
</p>
<p>
Then were those two eager to help him because of the oath. And quickly the
younger heroes prepared a feast for the aged man, a last prey for the Harpies;
and both stood near him, to smite with the sword those pests when they swooped
down. Scarcely had the aged man touched the food when they forthwith, like
bitter blasts or flashes of lightning, suddenly darted from the clouds, and
swooped down with a yell, fiercely craving for food; and the heroes beheld them
and shouted in the midst of their onrush; but they at the cry devoured
everything and sped away over the sea after; and an intolerable stench
remained. And behind them the two sons of Boreas raising their swords rushed in
pursuit. For Zeus imparted to them tireless strength; but without Zeus they
could not have followed, for the Harpies used ever to outstrip the blasts of
the west wind when they came to Phineus and when they left him. And as when,
upon the mountain-side, hounds, cunning in the chase, run in the track of
horned goats or deer, and as they strain a little behind gnash their teeth upon
the edge of their jaws in vain; so Zetes and Calais rushing very near just
grazed the Harpies in vain with their finger-tips. And assuredly they would
have torn them to pieces, despite heaven’s will, when they had overtaken
them far off at the Floating Islands, had not swift Iris seen them and leapt
down from the sky from heaven above, and cheeked them with these words:
</p>
<p>
“It is not lawful, O sons of Boreas, to strike with your swords the
Harpies, the hounds of mighty Zeus; but I myself will give you a pledge, that
hereafter they shall not draw near to Phineus.”
</p>
<p>
With these words she took an oath by the waters of Styx, which to all the gods
is most dread and most awful, that the Harpies would never thereafter again
approach the home of Phineus, son of Agenor, for so it was fated. And the
heroes yielding to the oath, turned back their flight to the ship. And on
account of this men call them the Islands of Turning though aforetime they
called them the Floating Islands. And the Harpies and Iris parted. They entered
their den in Minoan Crete; but she sped up to Olympus, soaring aloft on her
swift wings.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the chiefs carefully cleansed the old man’s squalid skin and
with due selection sacrificed sheep which they had borne away from the spoil of
Amycus. And when they had laid a huge supper in the hall, they sat down and
feasted, and with them feasted Phineus ravenously, delighting his soul, as in a
dream. And there, when they had taken their fill of food and drink, they kept
awake all night waiting for the sons of Boreas. And the aged sire himself sat
in the midst, near the hearth, telling of the end of their voyage and the
completion of their journey:
</p>
<p>
“Listen then. Not everything is it lawful for you to know clearly; but
whatever is heaven’s will, I will not hide. I was infatuated aforetime,
when in my folly I declared the will of Zeus in order and to the end. For he
himself wishes to deliver to men the utterances of the prophetic art
incomplete, in order that they may still have some need to know the will of
heaven.”
</p>
<p>
“First of all, after leaving me, ye will see the twin Cyanean rocks where
the two seas meet. No one, I ween, has won his escape between them. For they
are not firmly fixed with roots beneath, but constantly clash against one
another to one point, and above a huge mass of salt water rises in a crest,
boiling up, and loudly dashes upon the hard beach. Wherefore now obey my
counsel, if indeed with prudent mind and reverencing the blessed gods ye pursue
your way; and perish not foolishly by a self-sought death, or rush on following
the guidance of youth. First entrust the attempt to a dove when ye have sent
her forth from the ship. And if she escapes safe with her wings between the
rocks to the open sea, then no more do ye refrain from the path, but grip your
oars well in your hands and cleave the sea’s narrow strait, for the light
of safety will be not so much in prayer as in strength of hands. Wherefore let
all else go and labour boldly with might and main, but ere then implore the
gods as ye will, I forbid you not. But if she flies onward and perishes midway,
then do ye turn back; for it is better to yield to the immortals. For ye could
not escape an evil doom from the rocks, not even if Argo were of iron.”
</p>
<p>
“O hapless ones, dare not to transgress my divine warning, even though ye
think that I am thrice as much hated by the sons of heaven as I am, and even
more than thrice; dare not to sail further with your ship in despite of the
omen. And as these things will fall, so shall they fall. But if ye shun the
clashing rocks and come scatheless inside Pontus, straightway keep the land of
the Bithynians on your right and sail on, and beware of the breakers, until ye
round the swift river Rhebas and the black beach, and reach the harbour of the
Isle of Thynias. Thence ye must turn back a little space through the sea and
beach your ship on the land of the Mariandyni lying opposite. Here is a
downward path to the abode of Hades, and the headland of Acherusia stretches
aloft, and eddying Acheron cleaves its way at the bottom, even through the
headland, and sends its waters forth from a huge ravine. And near it ye will
sail past many hills of the Paphlagonians, over whom at the first Eneteian
Pelops reigned, and of his blood they boast themselves to be.”
</p>
<p>
“Now there is a headland opposite Helice the Bear, steep on all sides,
and they call it Carambis, about whose crests the blasts of the north wind are
sundered. So high in the air does it rise turned towards the sea. And when ye
have rounded it broad Aegialus stretches before you; and at the end of broad
Aegialus, at a jutting point of coast, the waters of the river Halys pour forth
with a terrible roar; and after it his flowing near, but smaller in stream,
rolls into the sea with white eddies. Onward from thence the bend of a huge and
towering cape reaches out from the land, next Thermodon at its mouth flows into
a quiet bay at the Themiscyreian headland, after wandering through a broad
continent. And here is the plain of Doeas, and near are the three cities of the
Amazons, and after them the Chalybes, most wretched of men, possess a soil
rugged and unyielding sons of toil, they busy themselves with working iron. And
near them dwell the Tibareni, rich in sheep, beyond the Genetaean headland of
Zeus, lord of hospitality. And bordering on it the Mossynoeci next in order
inhabit the well-wooded mainland and the parts beneath the mountains, who have
built in towers made from trees their wooden homes and well-fitted chambers,
which they call Mossynes, and the people themselves take their name from them.
After passing them ye must beach your ship upon a smooth island, when ye have
driven away with all manner of skill the ravening birds, which in countless
numbers haunt the desert island. In it the Queens of the Amazons, Otrere and
Antiope, built a stone temple of Ares what time they went forth to war. Now
here an unspeakable help will come to you from the bitter sea; wherefore with
kindly intent I bid you stay. But what need is there that I should sin yet
again declaring everything to the end by my prophetic art? And beyond the
island and opposite mainland dwell the Philyres: and above the Philyres are the
Macrones, and after them the vast tribes of the Becheiri. And next in order to
them dwell the Sapeires, and the Byzeres have the lands adjoining to them, and
beyond them at last live the warlike Colchians themselves. But speed on in your
ship, till ye touch the inmost bourne of the sea. And here at the Cytaean
mainland and from the Amarantine mountains far away and the Circaean plain,
eddying Phasis rolls his broad stream to the sea. Guide your ship to the mouth
of that river and ye shall behold the towers of Cytaean Aeetes and the shady
grove of Ares, where a dragon, a monster terrible to behold, ever glares
around, keeping watch over the fleece that is spread upon the top of an oak;
neither by day nor by night does sweet sleep subdue his restless eyes.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, and straightway fear seized them as they heard. And for a long
while they were struck with silence; till at last the hero, son of Aeson,
spake, sore dismayed at their evil plight:
</p>
<p>
“O aged sire, now hast thou come to the end of the toils of our
sea-journeying and hast told us the token, trusting to which we shall make our
way to Pontus through the hateful rocks; but whether, when we have escaped
them, we shall have a return back again to Hellas, this too would we gladly
learn from thee. What shall I do, how shall I go over again such a long path
through the sea, unskilled as I am, with unskilled comrades? And Colchian Aea
lies at the edge of Pontus and of the world.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, and him the aged sire addressed in reply: “O son, when
once thou hast escaped through the deadly rocks, fear not; for a deity will be
the guide from Aea by another track; and to Aea there will be guides enough.
But, my friends, take thought of the artful aid of the Cyprian goddess. For on
her depends the glorious issue of your venture. And further than this ask me
not.”
</p>
<p>
Thus spake Agenor’s son, and close at hand the twin sons of Thracian
Boreas came darting from the sky and set their swift feet upon the threshold;
and the heroes rose up from their seats when they saw them present. And Zetes,
still drawing hard breath after his toil, spake among the eager listeners,
telling them how far they had driven the Harpies and how his prevented their
slaying them, and how the goddess of her grace gave them pledges, and how those
others in fear plunged into the vast cave of the Dictaean cliff. Then in the
mansion all their comrades were joyful at the tidings and so was Phineus
himself. And quickly Aeson’s son, with good will exceeding, addressed
him:
</p>
<p>
“Assuredly there was then, Phineus, some god who cared for thy bitter
woe, and brought us hither from afar, that the sons of Boreas might aid thee;
and if too he should bring sight to thine eyes, verily I should rejoice,
methinks, as much as if I were on my homeward way.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, but Phineus replied to him with downcast look: “Son of
Aeson, that is past recall, nor is there any remedy hereafter, for blasted are
my sightless eyes. But instead of that, may the god grant me death at once, and
after death I shall take my share in perfect bliss.”
</p>
<p>
Then they two returned answering speech, each to other, and soon in the midst
of their converse early dawn appeared; and round Phineus were gathered the
neighbours who used to come thither aforetime day by day and constantly bring a
portion of their food. To all alike, however poor he was that came, the aged
man gave his oracles with good will, and freed many from their woes by his
prophetic art; wherefore they visited and tended him. And with them came
Paraebius, who was dearest to him, and gladly did he perceive these strangers
in the house. For long ere now the seer himself had said that a band of
chieftains, faring from Hellas to the city of Aceres, would make fast their
hawsers to the Thynian land, and by Zeus’ will would check the approach
of the Harpies. The rest the old man pleased with words of wisdom and let them
go; Paraebius only he bade remain there with the chiefs; and straightway he
sent him and bade him bring back the choicest of his sheep. And when he had
left the hall Phineus spake gently amid the throng of oarsmen:
</p>
<p>
“O my friends, not all men are arrogant, it seems, nor unmindful of
benefits. Even as this man, loyal as he is, came hither to learn his fate. For
when he laboured the most and toiled the most, then the needs of life, ever
growing more and more, would waste him, and day after day ever dawned more
wretched, nor was there any respite to his toil. But he was paying the sad
penalty of his father’s sin. For he when alone on the mountains, felling
trees, once slighted the prayers of a Hamadryad, who wept and sought to soften
him with plaintive words, not to cut down the stump of an oak tree coeval with
herself, wherein for a long time she had lived continually; but he in the
arrogance of youth recklessly cut it down. So to him the nymph thereafter made
her death a curse, to him and to his children. I indeed knew of the sin when he
came; and I bid him build an altar to the Thynian nymph, and offer on it an
atoning sacrifice, with prayer to escape his father’s fate. Here, ever
since he escaped the god-sent doom, never has he forgotten or neglected me; but
sorely and against his will do I send him from my doors, so eager is he to
remain with me in my affliction.”
</p>
<p>
Thus spake Agenor’s son; and his friend straightway came near leading two
sheep from the flock. And up rose Jason and up rose the sons of Boreas at the
bidding of the aged sire. And quickly they called upon Apollo, lord of
prophecy, and offered sacrifice upon the health as the day was just sinking.
And the younger comrades made ready a feast to their hearts’ desire.
Thereupon having well feasted they turned themselves to rest, some near the
ship’s hawsers, others in groups throughout the mansion. And at dawn the
Etesian winds blew strongly, which by the command of Zeus blow over every land
equally.
</p>
<p>
Cyrene, the tale goes, once tended sheep along the marsh-meadow of Peneus among
men of old time; for dear to her were maidenhood and a couch unstained. But, as
she guarded her flock by the river, Apollo carried her off far from Haemonia
and placed her among the nymphs of the land, who dwelt in Libya near the
Myrtosian height. And here to Phoebus she bore Aristaeus whom the Haemonians,
rich in corn-land, call “Hunter” and “Shepherd”. Her,
of his love, the god made a nymph there, of long life and a huntress, and his
son he brought while still an infant to be nurtured in the cave of Cheiron. And
to him when he grew to manhood the Muses gave a bride, and taught him the arts
of healing and of prophecy; and they made him the keeper of their sheep, of all
that grazed on the Athamantian plain of Phthia and round steep Othrys and the
sacred stream of the river Apidanus. But when from heaven Sirius scorched the
Minoan Isles, and for long there was no respite for the inhabitants, then by
the injunction of the Far-Darter they summoned Aristaeus to ward off the
pestilence. And by his father’s command he left Phthia and made his home
in Ceos, and gathered together the Parrhasian people who are of the lineage of
Lycaon, and he built a great altar to Zeus Icmaeus, and duly offered sacrifices
upon the mountains to that star Sirius, and to Zeus son of Cronos himself. And
on this account it is that Etesian winds from Zeus cool the land for forty
days, and in Ceos even now the priests offer sacrifices before the rising of
the Dog-star.
</p>
<p>
So the tale is told, but the chieftains stayed there by constraint, and every
day the Thynians, doing pleasure to Phineus, sent them gifts beyond measure.
And afterwards they raised an altar to the blessed twelve on the sea-beach
opposite and laid offerings thereon and then entered their swift ship to row,
nor did they forget to bear with them a trembling dove; but Euphemus seized her
and brought her all quivering with fear, and they loosed the twin hawsers from
the land.
</p>
<p>
Nor did they start unmarked by Athena, but straightway swiftly she set her feel
on a light cloud, which would waft her on, mighty though she was, and she swept
on to the sea with friendly thoughts to the oarsmen. And as when one roveth far
from his native land, as we men often wander with enduring heart, nor is any
land too distant but all ways are clear to his view, and he sees in mind his
own home, and at once the way over sea and land seems slain, and swiftly
thinking, now this way, now that, he strains with eager eyes; so swiftly the
daughter of Zeus darted down and set her foot on the cheerless shore of Thynia.
</p>
<p>
Now when they reached the narrow strait of the winding passage, hemmed in on
both sides by rugged cliffs, while an eddying current from below was washing
against the ship as she moved on, they went forward sorely in dread; and now
the thud of the crashing rocks ceaselessly struck their ears, and the
sea-washed shores resounded, and then Euphemus grasped the dove in his hand and
started to mount the prow; and they, at the bidding of Tiphys, son of Hagnias,
rowed with good will to drive Argo between the rocks, trusting to their
strength. And as they rounded a bend they saw the rocks opening for the last
time of all. Their spirit melted within them; and Euphemus sent forth the dove
to dart forward in flight; and they all together raised their heads to look;
but she flew between them, and the rocks again rushed together and crashed as
they met face to face. And the foam leapt up in a mass like a cloud; awful was
the thunder of the sea; and all round them the mighty welkin roared.
</p>
<p>
The hollow caves beneath the rugged cliffs rumbled as the sea came surging in;
and the white foam of the dashing wave spurted high above the cliff. Next the
current whirled the ship round. And the rocks shore away the end of the
dove’s tail-feathers; but away she flew unscathed. And the rowers gave a
loud cry; and Tiphys himself called to them to row with might and main. For the
rocks were again parting asunder. But as they rowed they trembled, until the
tide returning drove them back within the rocks. Then most awful fear seized
upon all; for over their head was destruction without escape. And now to right
and left broad Pontus was seen, when suddenly a huge wave rose up before them,
arched, like a steep rock; and at the sight they bowed with bended heads. For
it seemed about to leap down upon the ship’s whole length and to
overwhelm them. But Tiphys was quick to ease the ship as she laboured with the
oars; and in all its mass the wave rolled away beneath the keel, and at the
stern it raised Argo herself and drew her far away from the rocks; and high in
air was she borne. But Euphemus strode among all his comrades and cried to them
to bend to their oars with all their might; and they with a shout smote the
water. And as far as the ship yielded to the rowers, twice as far did she leap
back, and the oar, were bent like curved bows as the heroes used their
strength.
</p>
<p>
Then a vaulted billow rushed upon them, and the ship like a cylinder ran on the
furious wave plunging through the hollow sea. And the eddying current held her
between the clashing rocks; and on each side they shook and thundered; and the
ship’s timbers were held fast. Then Athena with her left hand thrust back
one mighty rock and with her right pushed the ship through; and she, like a
winged arrow, sped through the air. Nevertheless the rocks, ceaselessly
clashing, shore off as she passed the extreme end of the stern-ornament. But
Athena soared up to Olympus, when they had escaped unscathed. And the rocks in
one spot at that moment were rooted fast for ever to each other, which thing
had been destined by the blessed gods, when a man in his ship should have
passed between them alive. And the heroes breathed again after their chilling
fear, beholding at the same time the sky and the expanse of sea spreading far
and wide. For they deemed that they were saved from Hades; and Tiphys first of
all began to speak:
</p>
<p>
“It is my hope that we have safely escaped this peril—we, and the
ship; and none other is the cause so much as Athena, who breathed into Argo
divine strength when Argus knitted her together with bolts; and she may not be
caught. Son of Aeson, no longer fear thou so much the hest of thy king, since a
god hath granted us escape between the rocks; for Phineus, Agenor’s son,
said that our toils hereafter would be lightly accomplished.”
</p>
<p>
He spake, and at once he sped the ship onward through the midst of the sea past
the Bithynian coast. But Jason with gentle words addressed him in reply:
“Tiphys, why dost thou comfort thus my grieving heart? I have erred and
am distraught in wretched and helpless ruin. For I ought, when Pelias gave the
command, to have straightway refused this quest to his face, yea, though I were
doomed to die pitilessly, torn limb from limb, but now I am wrapped in
excessive fear and cares unbearable, dreading to sail through the chilling
paths of the sea, and dreading when we shall set foot on the mainland. For on
every side are unkindly men. And ever when day is done I pass a night of groans
from the time when ye first gathered together for my sake, while I take thought
for all things; but thou talkest at thine ease, eating only for thine own life;
while for myself I am dismayed not a whit; but I fear for this man and for that
equally, and for thee, and for my other comrades, if I shall not bring you back
safe to the land of Hellas.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, making trial of the chiefs; but they shouted loud with cheerful
words. And his heart was warmed within him at their cry and again he spake
outright among them:
</p>
<p>
“My friends, in your valour my courage is quickened. Wherefore now, even
though I should take my way through the gulfs of Hades, no more shall I let
fear seize upon me, since ye are steadfast amid cruel terrors. But now that we
have sailed out from the striking rocks, I trow that never hereafter will there
be another such fearful thing, if indeed we go on our way following the counsel
of Phineus.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, and straightway they ceased from such words and gave unwearying
labour to the oar; and quickly they passed by the swiftly flowing river Rhebas
and the peak of Colone, and soon thereafter the black headland, and near it the
mouth of the river Phyllis, where aforetime Dipsaeus received in his home the
son of Athamas, when with his ram he was flying from the city of Orchomenus;
and Dipsacus was the son of a meadow-nymph, nor was insolence his delight, but
contented by his father’s stream he dwelt with his mother, pasturing his
flocks by the shore. And quickly they sighted and sailed past his shrine and
the broad banks of the river and the plain, and deep-flowing Calpe, and all the
windless night and the day they bent to their tireless oars. And even as
ploughing oxen toil as they cleave the moist earth, and sweat streams in
abundance from flank and neck; and from beneath the yoke their eyes roll
askance, while the breath ever rushes from their mouths in hot gasps; and all
day long they toil, planting their hoofs deep in the ground; like them the
heroes kept dragging their oars through the sea.
</p>
<p>
Now when divine light has not yet come nor is it utter darkness, but a faint
glimmer has spread over the night, the time when men wake and call it twilight,
at that hour they ran into the harbour of the desert island Thynias and, spent
by weary toil, mounted the shore. And to them the son of Leto, as he passed
from Lycia far away to the countless folk of the Hyperboreans, appeared; and
about his cheeks on both sides his golden locks flowed in clusters as he moved;
in his left hand he held a silver bow, and on his back was slung a quiver
hanging from his shoulders; and beneath his feet all the island quaked, and the
waves surged high on the beach. Helpless amazement seized them as they looked;
and no one dared to gaze face to face into the fair eyes of the god. And they
stood with heads bowed to the ground; but he, far off, passed on to the sea
through the air; and at length Orpheus spake as follows, addressing the chiefs:
</p>
<p>
“Come, let us call this island the sacred isle of Apollo of the Dawn
since he has appeared to all, passing by at dawn; and we will offer such
sacrifices as we can, building an altar on the shore; and if hereafter he shall
grant us a safe return to the Haemonian land, then will we lay on his altar the
thighs of horned goats. And now I bid you propitiate him with the steam of
sacrifice and libations. Be gracious, O king, be gracious in thy
appearing.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, and they straightway built up an altar with shingle; and over
the island they wandered, seeking if haply they could get a glimpse of a fawn
or a wild goat, that often seek their pasture in the deep wood. And for them
Leto’s son provided a quarry; and with pious rites they wrapped in fat
the thigh bones of them all and burnt them on the sacred altar, celebrating
Apollo, Lord of Dawn. And round the burning sacrifice they set up a broad
dancing-ring, singing, “All hail fair god of healing, Phoebus, all
hail,” and with them Oeagrus’ goodly son began a clear lay on his
Bistonian lyre; how once beneath the rocky ridge of Parnassus he slew with his
bow the monster Delphyne, he, still young and beardless, still rejoicing in his
long tresses. Mayst thou be gracious! Ever, O king, be thy locks unshorn, ever
unravaged; for so is it right. And none but Leto, daughter of Coeus, strokes
them with her dear hands. And often the Corycian nymphs, daughters of Pleistus,
took up the cheering strain crying “Healer”; hence arose this
lovely refrain of the hymn to Phoebus.
</p>
<p>
Now when they had celebrated him with dance and song they took an oath with
holy libations, that they would ever help each other with concord of heart,
touching the sacrifice as they swore; and even now there stands there a temple
to gracious Concord, which the heroes themselves reared, paying honour at that
time to the glorious goddess.
</p>
<p>
Now when the third morning came, with a fresh west wind they left the lofty
island. Next, on the opposite side they saw and passed the mouth of the river
Sangarius and the fertile land of the Mariandyni, and the stream of Lycus and
the Anthemoeisian lake; and beneath the breeze the ropes and all the tackling
quivered as they sped onward. During the night the wind ceased and at dawn they
gladly reached the haven of the Acherusian headland. It rises aloft with steep
cliffs, looking towards the Bithynian sea; and beneath it smooth rocks, ever
washed by the sea, stand rooted firm; and round them the wave rolls and
thunders loud, but above, wide-spreading plane trees grow on the topmost point.
And from it towards the land a hollow glen slopes gradually away, where there
is a cave of Hades overarched by wood and rocks. From here an icy breath,
unceasingly issuing from the chill recess, ever forms a glistening rime which
melts again beneath the midday sun. And never does silence hold that grim
headland, but there is a continual murmur from the sounding sea and the leaves
that quiver in the winds from the cave. And here is the outfall of the river
Acheron which bursts its way through the headland and falls into the Eastern
sea, and a hollow ravine brings it down from above. In after times the Nisaean
Megarians named it Soonautes when they were about to settle in
the land of the Mariandyni. For indeed the river saved them with their ships
when they were caught in a violent tempest. By this way the heroes took the
ship through the Acherusian headland and came
to land over against it as the wind had just ceased.
</p>
<p>
Not long had they come unmarked by Lycus, the lord of that land, and the
Mariandyni—they, the slayers of Amycus, according to the report which the
people heard before; but for that very deed they even made a league with the
heroes. And Polydeuces himself they welcomed as a god, flocking from every
side, since for a long time had they been warring against the arrogant
Bebrycians. And so they went up all together into the city, and all that day
with friendly feelings made ready a feast within the palace of Lycus and
gladdened their souls with converse. Aeson’s son told him the lineage and
name of each of his comrades and the behests of Pelias, and how they were
welcomed by the Lemnian women, and all that they did at Dolionian Cyzieus; and
how they reached the Mysian land and Cius, where, sore against their will, they
left behind the hero Heracles, and he told the saying of Glaucus, and how they
slew the Bebrycians and Amycus, and he told of the prophecies and affliction of
Phineus, and how they escaped the Cyanean rocks, and how they met with
Leto’s son at the island. And as he told all, Lycus was charmed in soul
with listening; and he grieved for Heracles left behind, and spake as follows
among them all:
</p>
<p>
“O friends, what a man he was from whose help ye have fallen away, as ye
cleave your long path to Aeetes; for well do I know that I saw him here in the
halls of Dascylus my father, when he came hither on foot through the land of
Asia bringing the girdle of warlike Hippolyte; and me he found with the down
just growing on my cheeks. And here, when my brother Priolas was slain by the
Mysians—my brother, whom ever since the people lament with most piteous
dirges—he entered the lists with Titias in boxing and slew him, mighty
Titias, who surpassed all the youths in beauty and strength; and he dashed his
teeth to the ground. Together with the Mysians he subdued beneath my
father’s sway the Phrygians also, who inhabit the lands next to us, and
he made his own the tribes of the Bithynians and their land, as far as the
mouth of Rhebas and the peak of Colone; and besides them the Paphlagonians of
Pelops yielded just as they were, even all those round whom the dark water of
Billaeus breaks. But now the Bebrycians and the insolence of Amycus have robbed
me, since Heracles dwells far away, for they have long been cutting off huge
pieces of my land until they have set their bounds at the meadows of
deep-flowing Hypius. Nevertheless, by your hands have they paid the penalty;
and it was not without the will of heaven, I trow, that he brought war on the
Bebrycians this day—he, the son of Tyndareus, when he slew that champion.
Wherefore whatever requital I am now able to pay, gladly will I pay it, for
that is the rule for weaker men when the stronger begin to help them. So with
you all, and in your company, I bid Dascylus my son follow; and if he goes, you
will find all men friendly that ye meet on your way through the sea even to the
mouth of the river Thermodon. And besides that, to the sons of Tyndareus will I
raise a lofty temple on the Acherusian height, which all sailors shall mark far
across the sea and shall reverence; and hereafter for them will I set apart
outside the city, as for gods, some fertile fields of the well-tilled
plain.”
</p>
<p>
Thus all day long they revelled at the banquet. But at dawn they hied down to
the ship in haste; and with them went Lycus himself, when he had given them
countless gifts to bear away; and with them he sent forth his son from his
home.
</p>
<p>
And here his destined fate smote Idmon, son of Abas, skilled in soothsaying;
but not at all did his soothsaying save him, for necessity drew him on to
death. For in the mead of the reedy river there lay, cooling his flanks and
huge belly in the mud, a white-tusked boar, a deadly monster, whom even the
nymphs of the marsh dreaded, and no man knew it; but all alone he was feeding
in the wide fell. But the son of Abas was passing along the raised banks of the
muddy river, and the boar from some unseen lair leapt out of the reed-bed, and
charging gashed his thigh and severed in twain the sinews and the bone. And
with a sharp cry the hero fell to the ground; and as he was struck his comrades
flocked together with answering cry. And quickly Peleus with his hunting spear
aimed at the murderous boar as he fled back into the fen; and again he turned
and charged; but Idas wounded him, and with a roar he fell impaled upon the
sharp spear. And the boar they left on the ground just as he had fallen there;
but Idmon, now at the last gasp, his comrades bore to the ship in sorrow of
heart, and he died in his comrades’ arms.
</p>
<p>
And here they stayed from taking thought for their voyaging and abode in grief
for the burial of their dead friend. And for three whole days they lamented;
and on the next they buried him with full honours, and the people and King
Lycus himself took part in the funeral rites; and, as is the due of the
departed, they slaughtered countless sheep at his tomb. And so a barrow to this
hero was raised in that land, and there stands a token for men of later days to
see, the trunk of a wild olive tree, such as ships are built of; and it
flourishes with its green leaves a little below the Acherusian headland. And if
at the bidding of the Muses I must tell this tale outright, Phoebus strictly
commanded the Boeotians and Nisaeans to worship him as guardian of their city,
and to build their city round the trunk of the ancient wild olive; but they,
instead of the god-fearing Aeolid Idmon, at this day honour Agamestor.
</p>
<p>
Who was the next that died? For then a second time the heroes heaped up a
barrow for a comrade dead. For still are to be seen two monuments of those
heroes. The tale goes that Tiphys son of Hagnias died; nor was it his destiny
thereafter to sail any further. But him there on the spot a short sickness laid
to rest far from his native land, when the company had paid due honours to the
dead son of Abas. And at the cruel woe they were seized with unbearable grief.
For when with due honours they had buried him also hard by the seer, they cast
themselves down in helplessness on the sea-shore silently, closely wrapped up,
and took no thought for meat or drink; and their spirit drooped in grief, for
all hope of return was gone. And in their sorrow they would have stayed from
going further had not Hera kindled exceeding courage in Ancaeus, whom near the
waters of Imbrasus Astypalaea bore to Poseidon; for especially was he skilled
in steering and eagerly did he address Peleus:
</p>
<p>
“Son of Aeacus, is it well for us to give up our toils and linger on in a
strange land? Not so much for my prowess in war did Jason take me with him in
quest of the fleece, far from Parthenia, as for my knowledge of ships.
Wherefore, I pray, let there be no fear for the ship. And so there are here
other men of skill, of whom none will harm our voyaging, whomsoever we set at
the helm. But quickly tell forth all this and boldly urge them to call to mind
their task.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake; and Peleus’ soul was stirred with gladness, and
straightway he spake in the midst of all: “My friends, why do we thus
cherish a bootless grief like this? For those two have perished by the fate
they have met with; but among our host are steersmen yet, and many a one.
Wherefore let us not delay our attempt, but rouse yourselves to the work and
cast away your griefs.”
</p>
<p>
And him in reply Aeson’s son addressed with helpless words: “Son of
Aeacus, where are these steersmen of thine? For those whom we once deemed to be
men of skill, they even more than I are bowed with vexation of heart. Wherefore
I forebode an evil doom for us even as for the dead, if it shall be our lot
neither to reach the city of fell Aeetes, nor ever again to pass beyond the
rocks to the land of Hellas, but a wretched fate will enshroud us here
ingloriously till we grow old for naught.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, but Ancaeus quickly undertook to guide the swift ship; for he
was stirred by the impulse of the goddess. And after him Erginus and Nauplius
and Euphemus started up, eager to steer. But the others held them back, and
many of his comrades granted it to Ancaeus.
</p>
<p>
So on the twelfth day they went aboard at dawn, for a strong breeze of westerly
wind was blowing. And quickly with the oars they passed out through the river
Acheron and, trusting to the wind, shook out their sails, and with canvas
spread far and wide they were cleaving their passage through the waves in fair
weather. And soon they passed the outfall of the river Callichorus, where, as
the tale goes, the Nysean son of Zeus, when he had left the tribes of the
Indians and came to dwell at Thebes, held revels and arrayed dances in front of
a cave, wherein he passed unsmiling sacred nights, from which time the
neighbours call the river by the name of Callichorus and the
cave Aulion.
</p>
<p>
Next they beheld the barrow of Sthenelus, Actor’s son, who on his way
back from the valorous war against the Amazons—for he had been the
comrade of Heracles—was struck by an arrow and died there upon the
sea-beach. And for a time they went no further, for Persephone herself sent
forth the spirit of Actor’s son which craved with many tears to behold
men like himself, even for a moment. And mounting on the edge of the barrow he
gazed upon the ship, such as he was when he went to war; and round his head a
fair helm with four peaks gleamed with its blood-red crest. And again he
entered the vast gloom; and they looked and marvelled; and Mopsus, son of
Ampycus, with word of prophecy urged them to land and propitiate him with
libations. Quickly they drew in sail and threw out hawsers, and on the strand
paid honour to the tomb of Sthenelus, and poured out drink offerings to him and
sacrificed sheep as victims. And besides the drink offerings they built an
altar to Apollo, saviour of ships, and burnt thigh bones; and Orpheus dedicated
his lyre; whence the place has the name of Lyra.
</p>
<p>
And straightway they went aboard as the wind blew strong; and they drew the
sail down, and made it taut to both sheets; then Argo was borne over the sea
swiftly, even as a hawk soaring high through the air commits to the breeze its
outspread wings and is borne on swiftly, nor swerves in its flight, poising in
the clear sky with quiet pinions. And lo, they passed by the stream of
Parthenius as it flows into the sea, a most gentle river, where the maid,
daughter of Leto, when she mounts to heaven after the chase, cools her limbs in
its much-desired waters. Then they sped onward in the night without ceasing,
and passed Sesamus and lofty Erythini, Crobialus, Cromna and woody Cytorus.
Next they swept round Carambis at the rising of the sun, and plied the oars
past long Aegialus, all day and on through the night.
</p>
<p>
And straightway they landed on the Assyrian shore where Zeus himself gave a
home to Sinope, daughter of Asopus, and granted her virginity, beguiled by his
own promises. For he longed for her love, and he promised to grant her whatever
her hearts desire might be. And she in her craftiness asked of him virginity.
And in like manner she deceived Apollo too who longed to wed her, and besides
them the river Halys, and no man ever subdued her in love’s embrace. And
there the sons of noble Deimachus of Tricca were still dwelling, Deileon,
Autolycus and Phlogius, since the day when they wandered far away from
Heracles; and they, when they marked the array of chieftains, went to meet them
and declared in truth who they were; and they wished to remain there no longer,
but as soon as Argestes blew went on ship-board. And so
with them, borne along by the swift breeze, the heroes left behind the river
Halys, and left behind his that flows hard by, and the delta-land of Assyria;
and on the same day they rounded the distant headland of the Amazons that
guards their harbour.
</p>
<p>
Here once when Melanippe, daughter of Ares, had, gone forth, the hero Heracles
caught her by ambuscade and Hippolyte gave him her glistening girdle as her
sister’s ransom, and he sent away his captive unharmed. In the bay of
this headland, at the outfall of Thermodon, they ran ashore, for the sea was
rough for their voyage. No river is like this, and none sends forth from itself
such mighty streams over the land. If a man should count every one he would
lack but four of a hundred, but the real spring is only one. This flows down to
the plain from lofty mountains, which, men say, are called the Amazonian
mountains. Thence it spreads inland over a hilly country straight forward;
wherefrom its streams go winding on, and they roll on, this way and that ever
more, wherever best they can reach the lower ground, one at a distance and
another near at hand; and many streams are swallowed up in the sand and are
without a name; but, mingled with a few, the main stream openly bursts with its
arching crest of foam into the inhospitable Pontus. And they would have tarried
there and have closed in battle with the Amazons, and would have fought not
without bloodshed for the Amazons were not gentle foes and regarded not
justice, those dwellers on the Doeantian plain; but grievous insolence and the
works of Ares were all their care; for by race they were the daughters of Ares
and the nymph Harmonia, who bare to Ares war-loving maids, wedded to him in the
glens of the Acmonian wood had not the breezes of Argestes come again from
Zeus; and with the wind they left the rounded beach, where the Themiscyreian
Amazons were arming for war. For they dwelt not gathered together in one city,
but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the
Themiscyreians, over whom at that time Hippolyte reigned, in another the
Lycastians, and in another the dart-throwing Chadesians. And the next day they
sped on and at nightfall they reached the land of the Chalybes.
</p>
<p>
That folk have no care for ploughing with oxen or for any planting of
honey-sweet fruit; nor yet do they pasture flocks in the dewy meadow. But they
cleave the hard iron-bearing land and exchange their wages for daily
sustenance; never does the morn rise for them without toil, but amid bleak
sooty flames and smoke they endure heavy labour.
</p>
<p>
And straightway thereafter they rounded the headland of Genetaean Zeus and sped
safely past the land of the Tibareni. Here when wives bring forth children to
their husbands, the men lie in bed and groan with their heads close bound; but
the women tend them with food, and prepare child-birth baths for them.
</p>
<p>
Next they reached the sacred mount and the land where the Mossynoeci dwell amid
high mountains in wooden huts, from which that people take their
name. And strange are their customs and laws. Whatever it is right to do openly
before the people or in the market place, all this they do in their homes, but
whatever acts we perform at home, these they perform out of doors in the midst
of the streets, without blame. And among them is no reverence for the
marriage-bed, but, like swine that feed in herds, no whit abashed in
others’ presence, on the earth they lie with the women. Their king sits
in the loftiest hut and dispenses upright judgments to the multitude, poor
wretch! For if haply he err at all in his decrees, for that day they keep him
shut up in starvation.
</p>
<p>
They passed them by and cleft their way with oars over against the island of
Ares all day long; for at dusk the light breeze left them. At last they spied
above them, hurtling through the air, one of the birds of Ares which haunt that
isle. It shook its wings down over the ship as she sped on and sent against her
a keen feather, and it fell on the left shoulder of goodly Oileus, and he
dropped his oar from his hands at the sudden blow, and his comrades marvelled
at the sight of the winged bolt. And Eribotes from his seat hard by drew out
the feather, and bound up the wound when he had loosed the strap hanging from
his own sword-sheath; and besides the first, another bird appeared swooping
down; but the hero Clytius, son of Eurytus—for he bent his curved bow,
and sped a swift arrow against the bird—struck it, and it whirled round
and fell close to the ship. And to them spake Amphidamas, son of Aleus:
</p>
<p>
“The island of Ares is near us; you know it yourselves now that ye have
seen these birds. But little will arrows avail us, I trow, for landing. But let
us contrive some other device to help us, if ye intend to land, bearing in mind
the injunction of Phineus. For not even could Heracles, when he came to
Arcadia, drive away with bow and arrow the birds that swam on the Stymphalian
lake. I saw it myself. But he shook in his hand a rattle of bronze and made a
loud clatter as he stood upon a lofty peak, and the birds fled far off,
screeching in bewildered fear. Wherefore now too let us contrive some such
device, and I myself will speak, having pondered the matter beforehand. Set on
your heads your helmets of lofty crest, then half row by turns, and half fence
the ship about with polished spears and shields. Then all together raise a
mighty shout so that the birds may be scared by the unwonted din, the nodding
crests, and the uplifted spears on high. And if we reach the island itself,
then make mighty noise with the clashing of shields.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, and the helpful device pleased all. And on their heads they
placed helmets of bronze, gleaming terribly, and the blood-red crests were
tossing. And half of them rowed in turn, and the rest covered the ship with
spears and shields. And as when a man roofs over a house with tiles, to be an
ornament of his home and a defence against rain, and one the fits firmly into
another, each after each; so they roofed over the ship with their shields,
locking them together. And as a din arises from a warrior-host of men sweeping
on, when lines of battle meet, such a shout rose upward from the ship into the
air. Now they saw none of the birds yet, but when they touched the island and
clashed upon their shields, then the birds in countless numbers rose in flight
hither and thither. And as when the son of Cronos sends from the clouds a dense
hailstorm on city and houses, and the people who dwell beneath hear the din
above the roof and sit quietly, since the stormy season has not come upon them
unawares, but they have first made strong their roofs; so the birds sent
against the heroes a thick shower of feather-shafts as they darted over the sea
to the mountains of the land opposite.
</p>
<p>
What then was the purpose of Phineus in bidding the divine band of heroes land
there? Or what kind of help was about to meet their desire?
</p>
<p>
The sons of Phrixus were faring towards the city of Orchomenus from Aea, coming
from Cytaean Aeetes, on board a Colchian ship, to win the boundless wealth of
their father; for he, when dying, had enjoined this journey upon them. And lo,
on that day they were very near that island. But Zeus had impelled the north
wind’s might to blow, marking by rain the moist path of Arcturus; and all
day long he was stirring the leaves upon the mountains, breathing gently upon
the topmost sprays; but at night he rushed upon the sea with monstrous force,
and with his shrieking blasts uplifted the surge; and a dark mist covered the
heavens, nor did the bright stars anywhere appear from among the clouds, but a
murky gloom brooded all around. And so the sons of Phrixus, drenched and
trembling in fear of a horrible doom, were borne along by the waves helplessly.
And the force of the wind had snatched away their sails and shattered in twain
the hull, tossed as it was by the breakers. And hereupon by heaven’s
prompting those four clutched a huge beam, one of many that were scattered
about, held together by sharp bolts, when the ship broke to pieces. And on to
the island the waves and the blasts of wind bore the men in their distress,
within a little of death. And straightway a mighty rain burst forth, and rained
upon the sea and the island, and all the country opposite the island, where the
arrogant Mossynoeci dwelt. And the sweep of the waves hurled the sons of
Phrixus, together with their massy beam, upon the beach of the island, in the
murky night; and the floods of rain from Zeus ceased at sunrise, and soon the
two bands drew near and met each other, and Argus spoke first:
</p>
<p>
“We beseech you, by Zeus the Beholder, whoever ye are, to be kindly and
to help us in our need. For fierce tempests, falling on the sea, have shattered
all the timbers of the crazy ship in which we were cleaving our path on
business bent. Wherefore we entreat you, if haply ye will listen, to grant us
just a covering for our bodies, and to pity and succour men in misfortune, your
equals in age. Oh, reverence suppliants and strangers for Zeus’ sake, the
god of strangers and suppliants. To Zeus belong both suppliants and strangers;
and his eye, methinks, beholdeth even us.”
</p>
<p>
And in reply the son of Aeson prudently questioned him, deeming that the
prophecies of Phineus were being fulfilled: “All these things will we
straightway grant you with right good will. But come tell me truly in what
country ye dwell and what business bids you sail across the sea, and tell me
your own glorious names and lineage.”
</p>
<p>
And him Argus, helpless in his evil plight, addressed: “That one Phrixus
an Aeolid reached Aea from Hellas you yourselves have clearly heard ere this, I
trow; Phrixus, who came to the city of Aeetes, bestriding a ram, which Hermes
had made all gold; and the fleece ye may see even now. The ram, at its own
prompting, he then sacrificed to Zeus, son of Cronos, above all, the god of
fugitives. And him did Aeetes receive in his palace, and with gladness of heart
gave him his daughter Chalciope in marriage without gifts of wooing.  From those two are we sprung. But
Phrixus died at last, an aged man, in the home of Aeetes; and we, giving heed
to our father’s behests, are journeying to Orehomenus to take the
possessions of Athamas. And if thou dost desire to learn our names, this is
Cytissorus, this Phrontis, and this Melas, and me ye may call Argus.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, and the chieftains rejoiced at the meeting, and tended them,
much marvelling. And Jason again in turn replied, as was fitting, with these
words:
</p>
<p>
“Surely ye are our kinsmen on my father’s side, and ye pray that
with kindly hearts we succour your evil plight. For Cretheus and Athamas were
brothers. I am the grandson of Cretheus, and with these comrades here I am
journeying from that same Hellas to the city of Aeetes. But of these things we
will converse hereafter. And do ye first put clothing upon you. By
heaven’s devising, I ween, have ye come to my hands in your sore
need.”
</p>
<p>
He spake, and out of the ship gave them raiment to put on. Then all together
they went to the temple of Ares to offer sacrifice of sheep; and in haste they
stood round the altar, which was outside the roofless temple, an altar built of
pebbles; within a black stone stood fixed, a sacred thing, to which of yore the
Amazons all used to pray. Nor was it lawful for them, when they came from the
opposite coast, to burn on this altar offerings of sheep and oxen, but they
used to slay horses which they kept in great herds. Now when they had
sacrificed and eaten the feast prepared, then Aeson’s son spake among
them and thus began:
</p>
<p>
“Zeus’ self, I ween, beholds everything; nor do we men escape his
eye, we that be god-fearing and just, for as he rescued your father from the
hands of a murderous step-dame and gave him measureless wealth besides; even so
hath he saved you harmless from the baleful storm. And on board this ship ye
may sail hither and thither, where ye will, whether to Aea or to the wealthy
city of divine Orthomenus. For our ship Athena built and with axe of bronze cut
her timbers near the crest of Pelion, and with the goddess wrought Argus. But
yours the fierce surge hath shattered, before ye came nigh to the rocks which
all day long clash together in the straits of the sea. But come, be yourselves
our helpers, for we are eager to bring to Hellas the golden fleece, and guide
us on our voyage, for I go to atone for the intended sacrifice of Phrixus, the
cause of Zeus’ wrath against the sons of Aeolus.”
</p>
<p>
He spake with soothing words; but horror seized them when they heard. For they
deemed that they would not find Aeetes friendly if they desired to take away
the ram’s fleece. And Argus spake as follows, vexed that they should busy
themselves with such a quest:
</p>
<p>
“My friends, our strength, so far as it avails, shall never cease to help
you, not one whit, when need shall come. But Aeetes is terribly armed with
deadly ruthlessness; wherefore exceedingly do I dread this voyage. And he
boasts himself to be the son of Helios; and all round dwell countless tribes of
Colchians; and he might match himself with Ares in his dread war-cry and giant
strength. Nay, to seize the fleece in spite of Aeetes is no easy task; so huge
a serpent keeps guard round and about it, deathless and sleepless, which Earth
herself brought forth on the sides of Caucasus, by the rock of Typhaon, where
Typhaon, they say, smitten by the bolt of Zeus, son of Cronos, when he lifted
against the god his sturdy hands, dropped from his head hot gore; and in such
plight he reached the mountains and plain of Nysa, where to this day he lies
whelmed beneath the waters of the Serbonian lake.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, and straightway many a cheek grew pale when they heard of so
mighty an adventure. But quickly Peleus answered with cheering words, and thus
spake:
</p>
<p>
“Be not so fearful in spirit, my good friend. For we are not so lacking
in prowess as to be no match for Aeetes to try his strength with arms; but I
deem that we too are cunning in war, we that go thither, near akin to the blood
of the blessed gods. Wherefore if he will not grant us the fleece of gold for
friendship’s sake, the tribes of the Colchians will not avail him, I
ween.”
</p>
<p>
Thus they addressed each other in turn, until again, satisfied with their
feast, they turned to rest. And when they rose at dawn a gentle breeze was
blowing; and they raised the sails, which strained to the rush of the wind, and
quickly they left behind the island of Ares.
</p>
<p>
And at nightfall they came to the island of Philyra, where Cronos, son of
Uranus, what time in Olympus he reigned over the Titans, and Zeus was yet being
nurtured in a Cretan cave by the Curetes of Ida, lay beside Philyra, when he
had deceived Rhea; and the goddess found them in the midst of their dalliance;
and Cronos leapt up from the couch with a rush in the form of a steed with
flowing mane, but Ocean’s daughter, Philyra, in shame left the spot and
those haunts, and came to the long Pelasgian ridges, where by her union with
the transfigured deity she brought forth huge Cheiron, half like a horse, half
like a god.
</p>
<p>
Thence they sailed on, past the Macrones and the far-stretching land of the
Becheiri and the overweening Sapeires, and after them the Byzeres; for ever
forward they clave their way, quickly borne by the gentle breeze. And lo, as
they sped on, a deep gulf of the sea was opened, and lo, the steep crags of the
Caucasian mountains rose up, where, with his limbs bound upon the hard rocks by
galling fetters of bronze, Prometheus fed with his liver an eagle that ever
rushed back to its prey. High above the ship at even they saw it flying with a
loud whirr, near the clouds; and yet it shook all the sails with the fanning of
those huge wings. For it had not the form of a bird of the air but kept poising
its long wing-feathers like polished oars. And not long after they heard the
bitter cry of Prometheus as his liver was being torn away; and the air rang
with his screams until they marked the ravening eagle rushing back from the
mountain on the self-same track. And at night, by the skill of Argus, they
reached broad-flowing Phasis, and the utmost bourne of the sea.
</p>
<p>
And straightway they let down the sails and the yard-arm and stowed them inside
the hollow mast-crutch, and at once they lowered the mast itself till it lay
along; and quickly with oars they entered the mighty stream of the river; and
round the prow the water surged as it gave them way. And on their left hand
they had lofty Caucasus and the Cytaean city of Aea, and on the other side the
plain of Ares and the sacred grove of that god, where the serpent was keeping
watch and ward over the fleece as it hung on the leafy branches of an oak. And
Aeson’s son himself from a golden goblet poured into the river libations
of honey and pure wine to Earth and to the gods of the country, and to the
souls of dead heroes; and he besought them of their grace to give kindly aid,
and to welcome their ship’s hawsers with favourable omen. And straightway
Ancaeus spake these words:
</p>
<p>
“We have reached the Colchian land and the stream of Phasis; and it is
time for us to take counsel whether we shall make trial of Aeetes with soft
words, or an attempt of another kind shall be fitting.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, and by the advice of Argus Jason bade them enter a shaded
backwater and let the ship ride at anchor off shore; and it was near at hand in
their course and there they passed the night. And soon the dawn appeared to
their expectant eyes.

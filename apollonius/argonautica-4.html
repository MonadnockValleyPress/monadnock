<h1>Argonautica</h1>
<h2>by Apollonius of Rhodes</h2>
<h3>Book IV</h3>
<p>
Now do thou thyself, goddess Muse, daughter of Zeus, tell of the labour and
wiles of the Colchian maiden. Surely my soul within me wavers with speechless
amazement as I ponder whether I should call it the lovesick grief of mad
passion or a panic flight, through which she left the Colchian folk.
</p>
<p>
Aeetes all night long with the bravest captains of his people was devising in
his halls sheer treachery against the heroes, with fierce wrath in his heart at
the issue of the hateful contest; nor did he deem at all that these things were
being accomplished without the knowledge of his daughters.
</p>
<p>
But into Medea’s heart Hera cast most grievous fear; and she trembled
like a nimble fawn whom the baying of hounds hath terrified amid the thicket of
a deep copse. For at once she truly forboded that the aid she had given was not
hidden from her father, and that quickly she would fill up the cup of woe. And
she dreaded the guilty knowledge of her handmaids; her eyes were filled with
fire and her ears rung with a terrible cry. Often did she clutch at her throat,
and often did she drag out her hair by the roots and groan in wretched despair.
There on that very day the maiden would have tasted the drugs and perished and
so have made void the purposes of Hera, had not the goddess driven her, all
bewildered, to flee with the sons of Phrixus; and her fluttering soul within
her was comforted; and then she poured from her bosom all the drugs back again
into the casket. Then she kissed her bed, and the folding-doors on both sides,
and stroked the walls, and tearing away in her hands a long tress of hair, she
left it in the chamber for her mother, a memorial of her maidenhood, and thus
lamented with passionate voice:
</p>
<p>
“I go, leaving this long tress here in my stead, O mother mine; take this
farewell from me as I go far hence; farewell Chalciope, and all my home. Would
that the sea, stranger, had dashed thee to pieces, ere thou camest to the
Colchian land!”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake, and from her eyes shed copious tears. And as a bondmaid steals
away from a wealthy house, whom fate has lately severed from her native land,
nor yet has she made trial of grievous toil, but still unschooled to misery and
shrinking in terror from slavish tasks, goes about beneath the cruel hands of a
mistress; even so the lovely maiden rushed forth from her home. But to her the
bolts of the doors gave way self-moved, leaping backwards at the swift strains
of her magic song. And with bare feet she sped along the narrow paths, with her
left hand holding her robe over her brow to veil her face and fair cheeks, and
with her right lifting up the hem of her tunic. Quickly along the dark track,
outside the towers of the spacious city, did she come in fear; nor did any of
the warders note her, but she sped on unseen by them. Thence she was minded to
go to the temple; for well she knew the way, having often aforetime wandered
there in quest of corpses and noxious roots of the earth, as a sorceress is
wont to do; and her soul fluttered with quivering fear. And the Titanian
goddess, the moon, rising from a far land, beheld her as she fled distraught,
and fiercely exulted over her, and thus spake to her own heart:
</p>
<p>
“Not I alone then stray to the Latinian cave, nor do I alone burn with
love for fair Endymion; oft times with thoughts of love have I been driven away
by thy crafty spells, in order that in the darkness of night thou mightest work
thy sorcery at ease, even the deeds dear to thee. And now thou thyself too hast
part in a like mad passion; and some god of affection has given thee Jason to
be thy grievous woe. Well, go on, and steel thy heart, wise though thou be, to
take up thy burden of pain, fraught with many sighs.”
</p>
<p>
Thus spake the goddess; but swiftly the maiden’s feet bore her, hasting
on. And gladly did she gain the high-bank of the river and beheld on the
opposite side the gleam of fire, which all night long the heroes were kindling
in joy at the contest’s issue. Then through the gloom, with clear-pealing
voice from across the stream, she called on Phrontis, the youngest of
Phrixus’ sons, and he with his brothers and Aeson’s son recognised
the maiden’s voice; and in silence his comrades wondered when they knew
that it was so in truth. Thrice she called, and thrice at the bidding of the
company Phrontis called out in reply; and meantime the heroes were rowing with
swift-moving oars in search of her. Not yet were they casting the ship’s
hawsers upon the opposite bank, when Jason with light feet leapt to land from
the deck above, and after him Phrontis and Argus, sons of Phrixus, leapt to the
ground; and she, clasping their knees with both hands, thus addressed them:
</p>
<p>
“Save me, the hapless one, my friends, from Aeetes, and yourselves too,
for all is brought to light, nor doth any remedy come. But let us flee upon the
ship, before the king mounts his swift chariot. And I will lull to sleep the
guardian serpent and give you the fleece of gold; but do thou, stranger, amid
thy comrades make the gods witness of the vows thou hast taken on thyself for
my sake; and now that I have fled far from my country, make me not a mark for
blame and dishonour for want of kinsmen.”
</p>
<p>
She spake in anguish; but greatly did the heart of Aeson’s son rejoice,
and at once, as she fell at his knees, he raised her gently and embraced her,
and spake words of comfort: “Lady, let Zeus of Olympus himself be witness
to my oath, and Hera, queen of marriage, bride of Zeus, that I will set thee in
my halls my own wedded wife, when we have reached the land of Hellas on our
return.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, and straightway clasped her right hand in his; and she bade them
row the swift ship to the sacred grove near at hand, in order that, while it
was still night, they might seize and carry off the fleece against the will of
Aeetes. Word and deed were one to the eager crew. For they took her on board,
and straightway thrust the ship from shore; and loud was the din as the
chieftains strained at their oars, but she, starting back, held out her hands
in despair towards the shore. But Jason spoke cheering words and restrained her
grief.
</p>
<p>
Now at the hour when men have cast sleep from their eyes&mdash;huntsmen, who,
trusting to their bounds, never slumber away the end of night, but avoid the
light of dawn lest, smiting with its white beams, it efface the track and scent
of the quarry&mdash;then did Aeson’s son and the maiden step forth from
the ship over a grassy spot, the “Ram’s couch” as men call
it, where it first bent its wearied knees in rest, bearing on its back the
Minyan son of Athamas. And close by, all smirched with soot, was the base of
the altar, which the Aeolid Phrixus once set up to Zeus, the altar of
fugitives, when he sacrificed the golden wonder at the bidding of Hermes who
graciously met him on the way. There by the counsels of Argus the chieftains
put them ashore.
</p>
<p>
And they two by the pathway came to the sacred grove, seeking the huge oak tree
on which was hung the fleece, like to a cloud that blushes red with the fiery
beams of the rising sun. But right in front the serpent with his keen sleepless
eyes saw them coming, and stretched out his long neck and hissed in awful wise;
and all round the long banks of the river echoed and the boundless grove. Those
heard it who dwelt in the Colchian land very far from Titanian Aea, near the
outfall of Lycus, the river which parts from loud-roaring Araxes and blends his
sacred stream with Phasis, and they twain flow on together in one and pour
their waters into the Caucasian Sea. And through fear young mothers awoke, and
round their new-born babes, who were sleeping in their arms, threw their hands
in agony, for the small limbs started at that hiss. And as when above a pile of
smouldering wood countless eddies of smoke roll up mingled with soot, and one
ever springs up quickly after another, rising aloft from beneath in wavering
wreaths; so at that time did that monster roll his countless coils covered with
hard dry scales. And as he writhed, the maiden came before his eyes, with sweet
voice calling to her aid Sleep, highest of gods, to charm the monster; and she
cried to the queen of the underworld, the night-wanderer, to be propitious to
her enterprise. And Aeson’s son followed in fear, but the serpent,
already charmed by her song, was relaxing the long ridge of his giant spine,
and lengthening out his myriad coils, like a dark wave, dumb and noiseless,
rolling over a sluggish sea; but still he raised aloft his grisly head, eager
to enclose them both in his murderous jaws. But she with a newly cut spray of
juniper, dipping and drawing untempered charms from her mystic brew, sprinkled
his eyes, while she chanted her song; and all around the potent scent of the
charm cast sleep; and on the very spot he let his jaw sink down; and far behind
through the wood with its many trees were those countless coils stretched out.
</p>
<p>
Hereupon Jason snatched the golden fleece from the oak, at the maiden bidding;
and she, standing firm, smeared with the charm the monster’s head, till
Jason himself bade her turn back towards their ship, and she left the grove of
Ares, dusky with shade. And as a maiden catches on her finely wrought robe the
gleam of the moon at the full, as it rises above her high-roofed chamber; and
her heart rejoices as she beholds the fair ray; so at that time did Jason
uplift the mighty fleece in his hands; and from the shimmering of the flocks of
wool there settled on his fair cheeks and brow a red flush like a flame. And
great as is the hide of a yearling ox or stag, which huntsmen call a brocket,
so great in extent was the fleece all golden above. Heavy it was, thickly
clustered with flocks; and as he moved along, even beneath his feet the sheen
rose up from the earth. And he strode on now with the fleece covering his left
shoulder from the height of his neck to his feet, and now again he gathered it
up in his hands; for he feared exceedingly, lest some god or man should meet
him and deprive him thereof.
</p>
<p>
Dawn was spreading over the earth when they reached the throng of heroes; and
the youths marvelled to behold the mighty fleece, which gleamed like the
lightning of Zeus. And each one started up eager to touch it and clasp it in
his hands. But the son of Aeson restrained them all, and threw over it a mantle
newly-woven; and he led the maiden to the stern and seated her there, and spake
to them all as follows:
</p>
<p>
“No longer now, my friends, forbear to return to your fatherland. For now
the task for which we dared this grievous voyage, toiling with bitter sorrow of
heart, has been lightly fulfilled by the maiden’s counsels. Her&mdash;for
such is her will&mdash;I will bring home to be my wedded wife; do ye preserve
her, the glorious saviour of all Achaea and of yourselves. For of a surety, I
ween, will Aeetes come with his host to bar our passage from the river into the
sea. But do some of you toil at the oars in turn, sitting man by man; and half
of you raise your shields of oxhide, a ready defence against the darts of the
enemy, and guard our return. And now in our hands we hold the fate of our
children and dear country and of our aged parents; and on our venture all
Hellas depends, to reap either the shame of failure or great renown.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, and donned his armour of war; and they cried aloud, wondrously
eager. And he drew his sword from the sheath and cut the hawsers at the stern.
And near the maiden he took his stand ready armed by the steersman Aneaeus, and
with their rowing the ship sped on as they strained desperately to drive her
clear of the river.
</p>
<p>
By this time Medea’s love and deeds had become known to haughty Aeetes
and to all the Colchians. And they thronged to the assembly in arms; and
countless as the waves of the stormy sea when they rise crested by the wind, or
as the leaves that fall to the ground from the wood with its myriad branches in
the month when the leaves fall&mdash;who could reckon their tale?&mdash;so they
in countless number poured along the banks of the river shouting in frenzy; and
in his shapely chariot Aeetes shone forth above all with his steeds, the gift
of Helios, swift as the blasts of the wind. In his left hand he raised his
curved shield, and in his right a huge pine-torch, and near him in front stood
up his mighty spear. And Apsyrtus held in his hands the reins of the steeds.
But already the ship was cleaving the sea before her, urged on by stalwart
oarsmen, and the stream of the mighty river rushing down. But the king in
grievous anguish lifted his hands and called on Helios and Zeus to bear witness
to their evil deeds; and terrible threats he uttered against all his people,
that unless they should with their own hands seize the maiden, either on the
land or still finding the ship on the swell of the open sea, and bring her
back, that so he might satisfy his eager soul with vengeance for all those
deeds, at the cost of their own lives they should learn and abide all his rage
and revenge.
</p>
<p>
Thus spake Aeetes; and on that same day the Colchians launched their ships and
cast the tackle on board, and on that same day sailed forth on the sea; thou
wouldst not say so mighty a host was a fleet of ships, but that a countless
flight of birds, swarm on swarm, was clamouring over the sea.
</p>
<p>
Swiftly the wind blew, as the goddess Hera planned, so that most quickly Aeaean
Medea might reach the Pelasgian land, a bane to the house of Pelias, and on the
third morn they bound the ship’s stern cables to the shores of the
Paphlagonians, at the mouth of the river Halys. For Medea bade them land and
propitiate Hecate with sacrifice. Now all that the maiden prepared for offering
the sacrifice may no man know, and may my soul not urge me to sing thereof. Awe
restrains my lips, yet from that time the altar which the heroes raised on the
beach to the goddess remains till now, a sight to men of a later day.
</p>
<p>
And straightway Aeson’s son and the rest of the heroes bethought them of
Phineus, how that he had said that their course from Aea should be different,
but to all alike his meaning was dim. Then Argus spake, and they eagerly
hearkened:
</p>
<p>
“We go to Orchomenus, whither that unerring seer, whom ye met aforetime,
foretold your voyage. For there is another course, signified by those priests
of the immortal gods, who have sprung from Tritonian Thebes. As yet all the
stars that wheel in the heaven were not, nor yet, though one should inquire,
could aught be heard of the sacred race of the Danai. Apidanean Arcadians alone
existed, Arcadians who lived even before the moon, it is said, eating acorns on
the hills; nor at that time was the Pelasgian land ruled by the glorious sons
of Deucalion, in the days when Egypt, mother of men of an older time, was
called the fertile Morning-land, and the river fair-flowing Triton, by which
all the Morning-land is watered; and never does the rain from Zeus moisten the
earth; but from the flooding of the river abundant crops spring up. From this
land, it is said, a king made his way all round through
the whole of Europe and Asia, trusting in the might and strength and courage of
his people; and countless cities did he found wherever he came, whereof some
are still inhabited and some not; many an age hath passed since then. But Aea
abides unshaken even now and the sons of those men whom that king settled to
dwell in Aea. They preserve the writings of their fathers, graven on pillars,
whereon are marked all the ways and the limits of sea and land as ye journey on
all sides round. There is a river, the uttermost horn of Ocean, broad and
exceeding deep, that a merchant ship may traverse; they call it Ister and have
marked it far off; and for a while it cleaves the boundless tilth alone in one
stream; for beyond the blasts of the north wind, far off in the Rhipaean
mountains, its springs burst forth with a roar. But when it enters the
boundaries of the Thracians and Scythians, here, dividing its stream into two,
it sends its waters partly into the Ionian sea, and
partly to the south into a deep gulf that bends upwards from the Trinaerian
sea, that sea which lies along your land, if indeed Achelous flows forth from
your land.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, and to them the goddess granted a happy portent, and all at the
sight shouted approval, that this was their appointed path. For before them
appeared a trail of heavenly light, a sign where they might pass. And gladly
they left behind there the son of Lyeus and with canvas outspread sailed over
the sea, with their eyes on the Paphlagonian mountains. But they did not round
Carambis, for the winds and the gleam of the heavenly fire stayed with them
till they reached Ister’s mighty stream.
</p>
<p>
Now some of the Colchians, in a vain search, passed out from Pontus through the
Cyanean rocks; but the rest went to the river, and them Apsyrtus led, and,
turning aside, he entered the mouth called Fair. Wherefore he outstripped the
heroes by crossing a neck of land into the furthest gulf of the Ionian sea. For
a certain island is enclosed by Ister, by name Peuee, three-cornered, its base
stretching along the coast, and with a sharp angle towards the river; and round
it the outfall is cleft in two. One mouth they call the mouth of Narex, and the
other, at the lower end, the Fair mouth. And through this Apsyrtus and his
Colchians rushed with all speed; but the heroes went upwards far away towards
the highest part of the island. And in the meadows the country shepherds left
their countless flocks for dread of the ships, for they deemed that they were
beasts coming forth from the monster-teeming sea. For never yet before had they
seen seafaring ships, neither the Scythians mingled with the Thracians, nor the
Sigynni, nor yet the Graucenii, nor the Sindi that now inhabit the vast desert
plain of Laurium. But when they had passed near the mount Angurum, and the
cliff of Cauliacus, far from the mount Angurum, round which Ister, dividing his
stream, falls into the sea on this side and on that, and the Laurian plain,
then indeed the Colchians went forth into the Cronian sea and cut off all the
ways, to prevent their foes’ escape. And the heroes came down the river
behind and reached the two Brygean isles of Artemis near at hand. Now in one of
them was a sacred temple; and on the other they landed, avoiding the host of
Apsyrtus; for the Colchians had left these islands out of many within the
river, just as they were, through reverence for the daughter of Zeus; but the
rest, thronged by the Colchians, barred the ways to the sea. And so on other
islands too, close by, Apsyrtus left his host as far as the river Salangon and
the Nestian land.
</p>
<p>
There the Minyae would at that time have yielded in grim fight, a few to many;
but ere then they made a covenant, shunning a dire quarrel; as to the golden
fleece, that since Aeetes himself had so promised them if they should fulfill
the contests, they should keep it as justly won, whether they carried it off by
craft or even openly in the king’s despite; but as to Medea&mdash;for
that was the cause of strife&mdash;that they should give her in ward to
Leto’s daughter apart from the throng, until some one of the kings that
dispense justice should utter his doom, whether she must return to her
father’s home or follow the chieftains to the land of Hellas.
</p>
<p>
Now when the maiden had mused upon all this, sharp anguish shook her heart
unceasingly; and quickly she called forth Jason alone apart from his comrades,
and led him aside until they were far away, and before his face uttered her
speech all broken with sobs:
</p>
<p>
“What is this purpose that ye are now devising about me, O son of Aeson?
Has thy triumph utterly cast forgetfulness upon thee, and reekest thou nothing
of all that thou spakest when held fast by necessity? Whither are fled the
oaths by Zeus the suppliants’ god, whither are fled thy honied promises?
For which in no seemly wise, with shameless will, I have left my country, the
glories of my home and even my parents&mdash;things that were dearest to me;
and far away all alone I am borne over the sea with the plaintive kingfishers
because of thy trouble, in order that I might save thy life in fulfilling the
contests with the oxen and the earthborn men. Last of all the fleece&mdash;when
the matter became known, it was by my folly thou didst win it; and a foul
reproach have I poured on womankind. Wherefore I say that as thy child, thy
bride and thy sister, I follow thee to the land of Hellas. Be ready to stand by
me to the end, abandon me not left forlorn of thee when thou dost visit the
kings. But only save me; let justice and right, to which we have both agreed,
stand firm; or else do thou at once shear through this neck with the sword,
that I may gain the guerdon due to my mad passion. Poor wretch! if the king, to
whom you both commit your cruel covenant, doom me to belong to my brother. How
shall I come to my father’s sight? Will it be with a good name? What
revenge, what heavy calamity shall I not endure in agony for the terrible deeds
I have done? And wilt thou win the return that thy heart desires? Never may
Zeus’ bride, the queen of all, in whom thou dost glory, bring that to
pass. Mayst thou some time remember me when thou art racked with anguish; may
the fleece like a dream vanish into the nether darkness on the wings of the
wind! And may my avenging Furies forthwith drive thee from thy country, for all
that I have suffered through thy cruelty! These curses will not be allowed to
fall unaccomplished to the ground. A mighty oath hast thou transgressed,
ruthless one; but not long shalt thou and thy comrades sit at ease casting eyes
of mockery upon me, for all your covenants.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake, seething with fierce wrath; and she longed to set fire to the
ship and to hew it utterly in pieces, and herself to fall into the raging
flame. But Jason, half afraid, thus addressed her with gentle words:
</p>
<p>
“Forbear, lady; me too this pleases not. But we seek some respite from
battle, for such a cloud of hostile men, like to a fire, surrounds us, on thy
account. For all that inhabit this land are eager to aid Apsyrtus, that they
may lead thee back home to thy father, like some captured maid. And all of us
would perish in hateful destruction, if we closed with them in fight; and
bitterer still will be the pain, if we are slain and leave thee to be their
prey. But this covenant will weave a web of guile to lead him to ruin. Nor will
the people of the land for thy sake oppose us, to favour the Colchians, when
their prince is no longer with them, who is thy champion and thy brother; nor
will I shrink from matching myself in fight with the Colchians, if they bar my
way homeward.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake soothing her; and she uttered a deadly speech: “Take heed
now. For when sorry deeds are done we must needs devise sorry counsel, since at
first I was distraught by my error, and by heaven’s will it was I wrought
the accomplishment of evil desires. Do thou in the turmoil shield me from the
Colchians’ spears; and I will beguile Apsyrtus to come into thy
hands&mdash;do thou greet him with splendid gifts&mdash;if only I could
persuade the heralds on their departure to bring him alone to hearken to my
words. Thereupon if this deed pleases thee, slay him and raise a conflict with
the Colchians, I care not.”
</p>
<p>
So they two agreed and prepared a great web of guile for Apsyrtus, and provided
many gifts such as are due to guests, and among them gave a sacred robe of
Hypsipyle, of crimson hue. The Graces with their own hands had wrought it for
Dionysus in sea-girt Dia, and he gave it to his son Thoas thereafter, and Thoas
left it to Hypsipyle, and she gave that fair-wrought guest-gift with many
another marvel to Aeson’s son to wear. Never couldst thou satisfy thy
sweet desire by touching it or gazing on it. And from it a divine fragrance
breathed from the time when the king of Nysa himself lay to rest thereon,
flushed with wine and nectar as he clasped the beauteous breast of the
maiden-daughter of Minos, whom once Theseus forsook in the island of Dia, when
she had followed him from Cnossus. And when she had worked upon the heralds to
induce her brother to come, as soon as she reached the temple of the goddess,
according to the agreement, and the darkness of night surrounded them, that so
she might devise with him a cunning plan for her to take the mighty fleece of
gold and return to the home of Aeetes, for, she said, the sons of Phrixus had
given her by force to the strangers to carry off; with such beguiling words she
scattered to the air and the breezes her witching charms, which even from afar
would have drawn down the savage beast from the steep mountain-height.
</p>
<p>
Ruthless Love, great bane, great curse to mankind, from thee come deadly
strifes and lamentations and groans, and countless pains as well have their
stormy birth from thee. Arise, thou god, and arm thyself against the sons of
our foes in such guise as when thou didst fill Medea’s heart with
accursed madness. How then by evil doom did she slay Apsyrtus when he came to
meet her? For that must our song tell next.
</p>
<p>
When the heroes had left the maiden on the island of Artemis, according to the
covenant, both sides ran their ships to land separately. And Jason went to the
ambush to lie in wait for Apsyrtus and then for his comrades. But he, beguiled
by these dire promises, swiftly crossed the swell of the sea in his ship, and
in dark night set foot on the sacred island; and faring all alone to meet her
he made trial in speech of his sister, as a tender child tries a wintry torrent
which not even strong men can pass through, to see if she would devise some
guile against the strangers. And so they two agreed together on everything; and
straightway Aeson’s son leapt forth from the thick ambush, lifting his
bare sword in his hand; and quickly the maiden turned her eyes aside and
covered them with her veil that she might not see the blood of her brother when
he was smitten. And Jason marked him and struck him down, as a butcher strikes
down a mighty strong-horned bull, hard by the temple which the Brygi on the
mainland opposite had once built for Artemis. In its vestibule he fell on his
knees; and at last the hero breathing out his life caught up in both hands the
dark blood as it welled from the wound; and he dyed with red his sister’s
silvery veil and robe as she shrank away. And with swift side-glance the
irresistible pitiless Fury beheld the deadly deed they had done. And the hero,
Aeson’s son, cut off the extremities of the dead man, and thrice licked
up some blood and thrice spat the pollution from his teeth, as it is right for
the slayer to do, to atone for a treacherous murder. And the clammy corpse he
hid in the ground where even now those bones lie among the Apsyrtians.
</p>
<p>
Now as soon as the heroes saw the blaze of a torch, which the maiden raised for
them as a sign to pursue, they laid their own ship near the Colchian ship, and
they slaughtered the Colchian host, as kites slay the tribes of wood-pigeons,
or as lions of the wold, when they have leapt amid the steading, drive a great
flock of sheep huddled together. Nor did one of them escape death, but the
heroes rushed upon the whole crew, destroying them like a flame; and at last
Jason met them, and was eager to give aid where none was needed; but already
they were taking thought for him too. Thereupon they sat to devise some prudent
counsel for their voyage, and the maiden came upon them as they pondered, but
Peleus spake his word first:
</p>
<p>
“I now bid you embark while it is still night, and take with your oars
the passage opposite to that which the enemy guards, for at dawn when they see
their plight I deem that no word urging to further pursuit of us will prevail
with them; but as people bereft of their king, they will be scattered in
grievous dissension. And easy, when the people are scattered, will this path be
for us on our return.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake; and the youths assented to the words of Aeacus’ son. And
quickly they entered the ship, and toiled at their oars unceasingly until they
reached the sacred isle of Electra, the highest of them all, near the river
Eridanus.
</p>
<p>
But when the Colchians learnt the death of their prince, verily they were eager
to pursue Argo and the Minyans through all the Cronian sea. But Hera restrained
them by terrible lightnings from the sky. And at last they loathed their own
homes in the Cytaean land, quailing before Aeetes’ fierce wrath; so they
landed and made abiding homes there, scattered far and wide. Some set foot on
those very islands where the heroes had stayed, and they still dwell there,
bearing a name derived from Apsyrtus; and others built a fenced city by the
dark deep Illyrian river, where is the tomb of Harmonia and Cadmus, dwelling
among the Encheleans; and others live amid the mountains which are called the
Thunderers, from the day when the thunders of Zeus, son of Cronos, prevented
them from crossing over to the island opposite.
</p>
<p>
Now the heroes, when their return seemed safe for them, fared onward and made
their hawsers fast to the land of the Hylleans. For the islands lay thick in
the river and made the path dangerous for those who sailed thereby. Nor, as
aforetime, did the Hylleans devise their hurt, but of their own accord
furthered their passage, winning as guerdon a mighty tripod of Apollo. For
tripods twain had Phoebus given to Aeson’s son to carry afar in the
voyage he had to make, at the time when he went to sacred Pytho to enquire
about this very voyage; and it was ordained by fate that in whatever land they
should be placed, that land should never be ravaged by the attacks of foemen.
Therefore even now this tripod is hidden in that land near the pleasant city of
Hyllus, far beneath the earth, that it may ever be unseen by mortals. Yet they
found not King Hyllus still alive in the land, whom fair Melite bare to
Heracles in the land of the Phaeacians. For he came to the abode of Nausithous
and to Macris, the nurse of Dionysus, to cleanse himself from the deadly murder
of his children; here he loved and overcame the water nymph Melite, the
daughter of the river Aegaeus, and she bare mighty Hyllus. But when he had
grown up he desired not to dwell in that island under the rule of Nausithous
the king; but he collected a host of native Phaeacians and came to the Cronian
sea; for the hero King Nausithous aided his journey, and there he settled, and
the Mentores slew him as he was fighting for the oxen of his field.
</p>
<p>
Now, goddesses, say how it is that beyond this sea, near the land of Ausonia
and the Ligystian isles, which are called Stoechades, the mighty tracks of the
ship Argo are clearly sung of. What great constraint and need brought the
heroes so far? What breezes wafted them?
</p>
<p>
When Apsyrtus had fallen in mighty overthrow Zeus himself, king of gods, was
seized with wrath at what they had done. And he ordained that by the counsels
of Aeaean Circe they should cleanse themselves from the terrible stain of blood
and suffer countless woes before their return. Yet none of the chieftains knew
this; but far onward they sped starting from the Hyllean land, and they left
behind all the islands that were beforetime thronged by the Colchians&mdash;the
Liburnian isles, isle after isle, Issa, Dysceladus, and lovely Pityeia. Next
after them they came to Corcyra, where Poseidon settled the daughter of Asopus,
fair-haired Corcyra, far from the land of Phlius, whence he had carried her off
through love; and sailors beholding it from the sea, all black with its sombre
woods, call it Corcyra the Black. And next they passed Melite, rejoicing in the
soft-blowing breeze, and steep Cerossus, and Nymphaea at a distance, where lady
Calypso, daughter of Atlas, dwelt; and they deemed they saw the misty mountains
of Thunder. And then Hera bethought her of the counsels and wrath of Zeus
concerning them. And she devised an ending of their voyage and stirred up
storm-winds before them, by which they were caught and borne back to the rocky
isle of Electra. And straightway on a sudden there called to them in the midst
of their course, speaking with a human voice, the beam of the hollow ship,
which Athena had set in the centre of the stem, made of Dodonian oak. And
deadly fear seized them as they heard the voice that told of the grievous wrath
of Zeus. For it proclaimed that they should not escape the paths of an endless
sea nor grievous tempests, unless Circe should purge away the guilt of the
ruthless murder of Apsyrtus; and it bade Polydeuces and Castor pray to the
immortal gods first to grant a path through the Ausonian sea where they should
find Circe, daughter of Perse and Helios.
</p>
<p>
Thus Argo cried through the darkness; and the sons of Tyndareus uprose, and
lifted their hands to the immortals praying for each boon: but dejection held
the rest of the Minyan heroes. And far on sped Argo under sail, and entered
deep into the stream of Eridanus; where once, smitten on the breast by the
blazing bolt, Phaethon half-consumed fell from the chariot of Helios into the
opening of that deep lake; and even now it belcheth up heavy steam clouds from
the smouldering wound. And no bird spreading its light wings can cross that
water; but in mid-course it plunges into the flame, fluttering. And all around
the maidens, the daughters of Helios, enclosed in tall poplars, wretchedly wail
a piteous plaint; and from their eyes they shed on the ground bright drops of
amber. These are dried by the sun upon the sand; but whenever the waters of the
dark lake flow over the strand before the blast of the wailing wind, then they
roll on in a mass into Eridanus with swelling tide. But the Celts have attached
this story to them, that these are the tears of Leto’s son, Apollo, that
are borne along by the eddies, the countless tears that he shed aforetime when
he came to the sacred race of the Hyperboreans and left shining heaven at the
chiding of his father, being in wrath concerning his son whom divine Coronis
bare in bright Lacereia at the mouth of Amyrus. And such is the story told
among these men. But no desire for food or drink seized the heroes nor were
their thoughts turned to joy. But they were sorely afflicted all day, heavy and
faint at heart, with the noisome stench, hard to endure, which the streams of
Eridanus sent forth from Phaethon still burning; and at night they heard the
piercing lament of the daughters of Helios, wailing with shrill voice; and, as
they lamented, their tears were borne on the water like drops of oil.
</p>
<p>
Thence they entered the deep stream of Rhodanus which flows into Eridanus; and
where they meet there is a roar of mingling waters. Now that river, rising from
the ends of the earth, where are the portals and mansions of Night, on one side
bursts forth upon the beach of Ocean, at another pours into the Ionian sea, and
on the third through seven mouths sends its stream to the Sardinian sea and its
limitless bay. And from Rhodanus they entered
stormy lakes, which spread throughout the Celtic mainland of wondrous size; and
there they would have met with an inglorious calamity; for a certain branch of
the river was bearing them towards a gulf of Ocean which in ignorance they were
about to enter, and never would they have returned from there in safety. But
Hera leaping forth from heaven pealed her cry from the Hercynian rock; and all
together were shaken with fear of her cry; for terribly crashed the mighty
firmament. And backward they turned by reason of the goddess, and noted the
path by which their return was ordained. And after a long while they came to
the beach of the surging sea by the devising of Hera, passing unharmed through
countless tribes of the Celts and Ligyans. For round them the goddess poured a
dread mist day by day as they fared on. And so, sailing through the midmost
mouth, they reached the Stoechades islands in safety by the aid of the sons of
Zeus; wherefore altars and sacred rites are established in their honour for
ever; and not that sea-faring alone did they attend to succour; but Zeus
granted to them the ships of future sailors too. Then leaving the Stoechades
they passed on to the island Aethalia, where after their toil they wiped away
with pebbles sweat in abundance; and pebbles like skin in colour are strewn on
the beach; and there are their quoits and
their wondrous armour; and there is the Argoan harbour called after them.
</p>
<p>
And quickly from there they passed through the sea, beholding the Tyrrhenian
shores of Ausonia; and they came to the famous harbour of Aeaea, and from the
ship they cast hawsers to the shore near at hand. And here they found Circe
bathing her head in the salt sea-spray, for sorely had she been scared by
visions of the night. With blood her chambers and all the walls of her palace
seemed to be running, and flame was devouring all the magic herbs with which
she used to bewitch strangers whoever came; and she herself with murderous
blood quenched the glowing flame, drawing it up in her hands; and she ceased
from deadly fear. Wherefore when morning came she rose, and with sea-spray was
bathing her hair and her garments. And beasts, not resembling the beasts of the
wild, nor yet like men in body, but with a medley of limbs, went in a throng,
as sheep from the fold in multitudes follow the shepherd. Such creatures,
compacted of various limbs, did each herself produce from the primeval slime
when she had not yet grown solid beneath a rainless sky nor yet had received a
drop of moisture from the rays of the scorching sun; but time combined these
forms and marshalled them in their ranks; in such wise these monsters shapeless
of form followed her. And exceeding wonder seized the heroes, and at once, as
each gazed on the form and face of Circe, they readily guessed that she was the
sister of Aeetes.
</p>
<p>
Now when she had dismissed the fears of her nightly visions, straightway she
fared backwards, and in her subtlety she bade the heroes follow, charming them
on with her hand. Thereupon the host remained steadfast at the bidding of
Aeson’s son, but Jason drew with him the Colchian maid. And both followed
the selfsame path till they reached the hall of Circe, and she in amaze at
their coming bade them sit on brightly burnished seats. And they, quiet and
silent, sped to the hearth and sat there, as is the wont of wretched
suppliants. Medea hid her face in both her hands, but Jason fixed in the ground
the mighty hilted sword with which he had slain Aeetes’ son; nor did they
raise their eyes to meet her look. And straightway Circe became aware of the
doom of a suppliant and the guilt of murder. Wherefore in reverence for the
ordinance of Zeus, the god of suppliants, who is a god of wrath yet mightily
aids slayers of men, she began to offer the sacrifice with which ruthless
suppliants are cleansed from guilt when they approach the altar. First, to
atone for the murder still unexpiated, she held above their heads the young of
a sow whose dugs yet swelled from the fruit of the womb, and, severing its
neck, sprinkled their hands with the blood; and again she made propitiation
with other drink offerings, calling on Zeus the Cleanser, the protector of
murder-stained suppliants. And all the defilements in a mass her attendants
bore forth from the palace&mdash;the Naiad nymphs who ministered all things to
her. And within, Circe, standing by the hearth, kept burning atonement-cakes
without wine, praying the while that she might stay from their wrath the
terrible Furies, and that Zeus himself might be propitious and gentle to them
both, whether with hands stained by the blood of a stranger or, as kinsfolk, by
the blood of a kinsman, they should implore his grace.
</p>
<p>
But when she had wrought all her task, then she raised them up and seated them
on well polished seats, and herself sat near, face to face with them. And at
once she asked them clearly of their business and their voyaging, and whence
they had come to her land and palace, and had thus seated themselves as
suppliants at her hearth. For in truth the hideous remembrance of her dreams
entered her mind as she pondered; and she longed to hear the voice of the
maiden, her kinswoman, as soon as she saw that she had raised her eyes from the
ground. For all those of the race of Helios were plain to discern, since by the
far flashing of their eyes they shot in front of them a gleam as of gold. So
Medea told her all she asked&mdash;the daughter of Aeetes of the gloomy heart,
speaking gently in the Colchian tongue, both of the quest and the journeyings
of the heroes, and of their toils in the swift contests, and how she had sinned
through the counsels of her much-sorrowing sister, and how with the sons of
Phrixus she had fled afar from the tyrannous horrors of her father; but she
shrank from telling of the murder of Apsyrtus. Yet she escaped not
Circe’s ken; nevertheless, in spite of all, she pitied the weeping
maiden, and spake thus:
</p>
<p>
“Poor wretch, an evil and shameful return hast thou planned. Not for
long, I ween, wilt thou escape the heavy wrath of Aeetes; but soon will he go
even to the dwellings of Hellas to avenge the blood of his son, for intolerable
are the deeds thou hast done. But since thou art my suppliant and my kinswoman,
no further ill shall I devise against thee at thy coming; but begone from my
halls, companioning the stranger, whosoever he be, this unknown one that thou
hast taken in thy father’s despite; and kneel not to me at my hearth, for
never will I approve thy counsels and thy shameful flight.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake, and measureless anguish seized the maid; and over her eyes she
cast her robe and poured forth a lamentation, until the hero took her by the
hand and led her forth from the hall quivering with fear. So they left the home
of Circe.
</p>
<p>
But they were not unmarked by the spouse of Zeus, son of Cronos; but Iris told
her when she saw them faring from the hall. For Hera had bidden her watch what
time they should come to the ship; so again she urged her and spake:
</p>
<p>
“Dear Iris, now come, if ever thou hast fulfilled my bidding, hie thee
away on light pinions, and bid Thetis arise from the sea and come hither. For
need of her is come upon me. Then go to the sea-beaches where the bronze anvils
of Hephaestus are smitten by sturdy hammers, and tell him to still the blasts
of fire until Argo pass by them. Then go to Aeolus too, Aeolus who rules the
winds, children of the clear sky; and to him also tell my purpose so that he
may make all winds cease under heaven and no breeze may ruffle the sea; yet let
the breath of the west wind blow until the heroes have reached the Phaeacian
isle of Alcinous.”
</p>
<p>
So she spake, and straightway Iris leapt down from Olympus and cleft her way,
with light wings outspread. And she plunged into the Aegean Sea, where is the
dwelling of Nereus. And she came to Thetis first and, by the promptings of
Hera, told her tale and roused her to go to the goddess. Next she came to
Hephaestus, and quickly made him cease from the clang of his iron hammers; and
the smoke-grimed bellows were stayed from their blast. And thirdly she came to
Aeolus, the famous son of Hippotas. And when she had given her message to him
also and rested her swift knees from her course, then Thetis leaving Nereus and
her sisters had come from the sea to Olympus to the goddess Hera; and the
goddess made her sit by her side and uttered her word:
</p>
<p>
“Hearken now, lady Thetis, to what I am eager to tell thee. Thou knowest
how honoured in my heart is the hero, Aeson’s son, and the others that
have helped him in the contest, and how I saved them when they passed between
the Wandering rocks, where roar terrible storms of
fire and the waves foam round the rugged reefs. And now past the mighty rock of
Scylla and Charybdis horribly belching, a course awaits them. But thee indeed
from thy infancy did I tend with my own hands and love beyond all others that
dwell in the salt sea because thou didst refuse to share the couch of Zeus, for
all his desire. For to him such deeds are ever dear, to embrace either
goddesses or mortal women. But in reverence for me and with fear in thy heart
thou didst shrink from his love; and he then swore a mighty oath that thou
shouldst never be called the bride of an immortal god. Yet he ceased not from
spying thee against thy will, until reverend Themis declared to him the whole
truth, how that it was thy fate to bear a son mightier than his sire; wherefore
he gave thee up, for all his desire, fearing lest another should be his match
and rule the immortals, and in order that he might ever hold his own dominion.
But I gave thee the best of the sons of earth to be thy husband, that thou
mightest find a marriage dear to thy heart and bear children; and I summoned to
the feast the gods, one and all. And with my own hand I raised the bridal
torch, in return for the kindly honour thou didst pay me. But come, let me tell
a tale that erreth not. When thy son shall come to the Elysian plain, he whom
now in the home of Cheiron the Centaur water-nymphs are tending, though he
still craves thy mother milk, it is fated that he be the husband of Medea,
Aeetes’ daughter; do thou aid thy daughter-in-law as a mother-in-law
should, and aid Peleus himself. Why is thy wrath so steadfast? He was blinded
by folly. For blindness comes even upon the gods. Surely at my behest I deem
that Hephaestus will cease from kindling the fury of his flame, and that
Aeolus, son of Hippotas, will check his swift rushing winds, all but the steady
west wind, until they reach the havens of the Phaeacians; do thou devise a
return without bane. The rocks and the tyrannous waves are my fear, they alone,
and them thou canst foil with thy sisters’ aid. And let them not fall in
their helplessness into Charybdis lest she swallow them at one gulp, or
approach the hideous lair of Scylla, Ausonian Scylla the deadly, whom
night-wandering Hecate, who is called Crataeis, bare to
Phoreys, lest swooping upon them with her horrible jaws she destroy the
chiefest of the heroes. But guide their ship in the course where there shall be
still a hair’s breadth escape from destruction.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake, and Thetis answered with these words: “If the fury of the
ravening flame and the stormy winds cease in very deed, surely will I promise
boldly to save the ship, even though the waves bar the way, if only the west
wind blows fresh and clear. But it is time to fare on a long and measureless
path, in quest of my sisters who will aid me, and to the spot where the
ship’s hawsers are fastened, that at early dawn the heroes may take
thought to win their home-return.”
</p>
<p>
She spake, and darting down from the sky fell amid the eddies of the dark blue
sea; and she called to aid her the rest of the Nereids, her own sisters; and
they heard her and gathered together; and Thetis declared to them Hera’s
behests, and quickly sped them all on their way to the Ausonian sea. And
herself, swifter than the flash of an eye or the shafts of the sun, when it
rises upwards from a far-distant land, hastened swiftly through the sea, until
she reached the Aeaean beach of the Tyrrhenian mainland. And the heroes she
found by the ship taking their pastime with quoits and shooting of arrows; and
she drew near and just touched the hand of Aeaeus’ son Peleus, for he was
her husband; nor could anyone see her clearly, but she appeared to his eyes
alone, and thus addressed him:
</p>
<p>
“No longer now must ye stay sitting on the Tyrrhenian beach, but at dawn
loosen the hawsers of your swift ship, in obedience to Hera, your helper. For
at her behest the maiden daughters of Nereus have met together to draw your
ship through the midst of the rocks which are called Planctae,  for that is your destined path.
But do thou show my person to no one, when thou seest us come to meet time, but
keep it secret in thy mind, lest thou anger me still more than thou didst anger
me before so recklessly.”
</p>
<p>
She spake, and vanished into the depths of the sea; but sharp pain smote
Peleus, for never before had he seen her come, since first she left her bridal
chamber and bed in anger, on account of noble Achilles, then a babe. For she
ever encompassed the child’s mortal flesh in the night with the flame of
fire; and day by day she anointed with ambrosia his tender frame, so that he
might become immortal and that she might keep off from his body loathsome old
age. But Peleus leapt up from his bed and saw his dear son gasping in the
flame; and at the sight he uttered a terrible cry, fool that he was; and she
heard it, and catching up the child threw him screaming to the ground, and
herself like a breath of wind passed swiftly from the hall as a dream and leapt
into the sea, exceeding wroth, and thereafter returned not again. Wherefore
blank amazement fettered his soul; nevertheless he declared to his comrades all
the bidding of Thetis. And they broke off in the midst and hurriedly ceased
their contests, and prepared their meal and earth-strewn beds, whereon after
supper they slept through the night as aforetime.
</p>
<p>
Now when dawn the light-bringer was touching the edge of heaven, then at the
coming of the swift west wind they went to their thwarts from the land; and
gladly did they draw up the anchors from the deep and made the tackling ready
in due order; and above spread the sail, stretching it taut with the sheets
from the yard-arm. And a fresh breeze wafted the ship on. And soon they saw a
fair island, Anthemoessa, where the clear-voiced Sirens, daughters of Achelous,
used to beguile with their sweet songs whoever cast anchor there, and then
destroy him. Them lovely Terpsichore, one of the Muses, bare, united with
Achelous; and once they tended Demeter’s noble daughter still unwed, and
sang to her in chorus; and at that time they were fashioned in part like birds
and in part like maidens to behold. And ever on the watch from their place of
prospect with its fair haven, often from many had they taken away their sweet
return, consuming them with wasting desire; and suddenly to the heroes, too,
they sent forth from their lips a lily-like voice. And they were already about
to cast from the ship the hawsers to the shore, had not Thracian Orpheus, son
of Oeagrus, stringing in his hands his Bistonian lyre, rung forth the hasty
snatch of a rippling melody so that their ears might be filled with the sound
of his twanging; and the lyre overcame the maidens’ voice. And the west
wind and the sounding wave rushing astern bore the ship on; and the Sirens kept
uttering their ceaseless song. But even so the goodly son of Teleon alone of
the comrades leapt before them all from the polished bench into the sea, even
Butes, his soul melted by the clear ringing voice of the Sirens; and he swam
through the dark surge to mount the beach, poor wretch. Quickly would they have
robbed him of his return then and there, but the goddess that rules Eryx,
Cypris, in pity snatched him away, while yet in the eddies, and graciously
meeting him saved him to dwell on the Lilybean height. And the heroes, seized
by anguish, left the Sirens, but other perils still worse, destructive to
ships, awaited them in the meeting-place of the seas.
</p>
<p>
For on one side appeared the smooth rock of Scylla; on the other Charybdis
ceaselessly spouted and roared; in another part the Wandering rocks were
booming beneath the mighty surge, where before the burning flame spurted forth
from the top of the crags, above the rock glowing with fire, and the air was
misty with smoke, nor could you have seen the sun’s light. Then, though
Hephaestus had ceased from his toils, the sea was still sending up a warm
vapour. Hereupon on this side and on that the daughters of Nereus met them; and
behind, lady Thetis set her hand to the rudder-blade, to guide them amid the
Wandering rocks. And as when in fair weather herds of dolphins come up from the
depths and sport in circles round a ship as it speeds along, now seen in front,
now behind, now again at the side and delight comes to the sailors; so the
Nereids darted upward and circled in their ranks round the ship Argo, while
Thetis guided its course. And when they were about to touch the Wandering
rocks, straightway they raised the edge of their garments over their snow-white
knees, and aloft, on the very rocks and where the waves broke, they hurried
along on this side and on that apart from one another. And the ship was raised
aloft as the current smote her, and all around the furious wave mounting up
broke over the rocks, which at one time touched the sky like towering crags, at
another, down in the depths, were fixed fast at the bottom of the sea and the
fierce waves poured over them in floods. And the Nereids, even as maidens near
some sandy beach roll their garments up to their waists out of their way and
sport with a shapely-rounded ball; then they catch it one from another and send
it high into the air; and it never touches the ground; so they in turn one from
another sent the ship through the air over the waves, as it sped on ever away
from the rocks; and round them the water spouted and foamed. And lord
Hephaestus himself standing on the summit of a smooth rock and resting his
massy shoulder on the handle of his hammer, beheld them, and the spouse of Zeus
beheld them as she stood above the gleaming heaven; and she threw her arms
round Athena, such fear seized her as she gazed. And as long as the space of a
day is lengthened out in springtime, so long a time did they toil, heaving the
ship between the loud-echoing rocks; then again the heroes caught the wind and
sped onward; and swiftly they passed the mead of Thrinacia, where the kine of
Helios fed. There the nymphs, like sea-mews, plunged beneath the depths, when
they had fulfilled the behests of the spouse of Zeus. And at the same time the
bleating of sheep came to the heroes through the mist and the lowing of kine,
near at hand, smote their ears. And over the dewy leas Phaethusa, the youngest
of the daughters of Helios, tended the sheep, bearing in her hand a silver
crook; while Lampetia, herding the kine, wielded a staff of glowing
orichalcum as she followed. These kine the heroes
saw feeding by the river’s stream, over the plain and the water-meadow;
not one of them was dark in hue but all were white as milk and glorying in
their horns of gold. So they passed them by in the day-time, and when night
came on they were cleaving a great sea-gulf, rejoicing, until again early
rising dawn threw light upon their course.
</p>
<p>
Fronting the Ionian gulf there lies an island in the Ceraunian sea, rich in
soil, with a harbour on both sides, beneath which lies the sickle, as legend
saith&mdash;grant me grace, O Muses, not willingly do I tell this tale of olden
days&mdash;wherewith Cronos pitilessly mutilated his father; but others call it
the reaping-hook of Demeter, goddess of the nether world. For Demeter once
dwelt in that island, and taught the Titans to reap the ears of corn, all for
the love of Macris. Whence it is called Drepane, the
sacred nurse of the Phaeacians; and thus the Phaeacians themselves are by birth
of the blood of Uranus. To them came Argo, held fast by many toils, borne by
the breezes from the Thrinacian sea; and Alcinous and his people with kindly
sacrifice gladly welcomed their coming; and over them all the city made merry;
thou wouldst say they were rejoicing over their own sons. And the heroes
themselves strode in gladness through the throng, even as though they had set
foot in the heart of Haemonia; but soon were they to arm and raise the
battle-cry; so near to them appeared a boundless host of Colchians, who had
passed through the mouth of Pontus and between the Cyanean rocks in search of
the chieftains. They desired forthwith to carry off Medea to her father’s
house apart from the rest, or else they threatened with fierce cruelty to raise
the dread war-cry both then and thereafter on the coming of Aeetes. But lordly
Alcinous checked them amid their eagerness for war. For he longed to allay the
lawless strife between both sides without the clash of battle. And the maiden
in deadly fear often implored the comrades of Aeson’s son, and often with
her hands touched the knees of Arete, the bride of Alcinous:
</p>
<p>
“I beseech thee, O queen, be gracious and deliver me not to the Colchians
to be borne to my father, if thou thyself too art one of the race of mortals,
whose heart rushes swiftly to ruin from light transgressions. For my firm sense
forsook me&mdash;it was not for wantonness. Be witness the sacred light of
Helios, be witness the rites of the maiden that wanders by night, daughter of
Perses. Not willingly did I haste from my home with men of an alien race; but a
horrible fear wrought on me to bethink me of flight when I sinned; other device
was there none. Still my maiden’s girdle remains, as in the halls of my
father, unstained, untouched. Pity me, lady, and turn thy lord to mercy; and
may the immortals grant thee a perfect life, and joy, and children, and the
glory of a city unravaged!”
</p>
<p>
Thus did she implore Arete, shedding tears, and thus each of the chieftains in
turn:
</p>
<p>
“On your account, ye men of peerless might, and on account of my toils in
your ventures am I sorely afflicted; even I, by whose help ye yoked the bulls,
and reaped the deadly harvest of the earthborn men; even I, through whom on
your homeward path ye shall bear to Haemonia the golden fleece. Lo, here am I,
who have lost my country and my parents, who have lost my home and all the
delights of life; to you have I restored your country and your homes; with eyes
of gladness ye will see again your parents; but from me a heavy-handed god has
raft all joy; and with strangers I wander, an accursed thing. Fear your
covenant and your oaths, fear the Fury that avenges suppliants and the
retribution of heaven, if I fall into Aeetes’ hands and am slain with
grievous outrage. To no shrines, no tower of defence, no other refuge do I pay
heed, but only to you. Hard and pitiless in your cruelty! No reverence have ye
for me in your heart though ye see me helpless, stretching my hands towards the
knees of a stranger queen; yet, when ye longed to seize the fleece, ye would
have met all the Colchians face to thee and haughty Aeetes himself; but now ye
have forgotten your courage, now that they are all alone and cut off.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake, beseeching; and to whomsoever she bowed in prayer, that man
tried to give her heart and to check her anguish. And in their hands they shook
their sharp pointed spears, and drew the swords from their sheaths; and they
swore they would not hold back from giving succour, if she should meet with an
unrighteous judgement. And the host were all wearied and Night came on them,
Night that puts to rest the works of men, and lulled all the earth to sleep;
but to the maid no sleep brought rest, but in her bosom her heart was wrung
with anguish. Even as when a toiling woman turns her spindle through the night,
and round her moan her orphan children, for she is a widow, and down her cheeks
fall the tears, as she bethinks her how dreary a lot hath seized her; so
Medea’s cheeks were wet; and her heart within her was in agony, pierced
with sharp pain.
</p>
<p>
Now within the palace in the city, as aforetime, lay lordly Alcinous and Arete,
the revered wife of Alcinous, and on their couch through the night they were
devising plans about the maiden; and him, as her wedded husband, the wife
addressed with loving words:
</p>
<p>
“Yea, my friend, come, save the woe-stricken maid from the Colchians and
show grace to the Minyae. Argos is near our isle and the men of Haemonia; but
Aeetes dwells not near, nor do we know of Aeetes one whit: we hear but his
name; but this maiden of dread suffering hath broken my heart by her prayers. O
king, give her not up to the Colchians to be borne back to her father’s
home. She was distraught when first she gave him the drugs to charm the oxen;
and next, to cure one ill by another, as in our sinning we do often, she fled
from her haughty sire’s heavy wrath. But Jason, as I hear, is bound to
her by mighty oaths that he will make her his wedded wife within his halls.
Wherefore, my friend, make not, of thy will, Aeson’s son to be forsworn,
nor let the father, if thou canst help, work with angry heart some intolerable
mischief on his child. For fathers are all too jealous against their children;
what wrong did Nycteus devise against Antiope, fair of face! What woes did
Danae endure on the wide sea through her sire’s mad rage! Of late, and
not far away, Echetus in wanton cruelty thrust spikes of bronze in his
daughter’s eyes; and by a grievous fate is she wasting away, grinding
grains of bronze in a dungeon’s gloom.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake, beseeching; and by his wife’s words his heart was
softened, and thus he spake:
</p>
<p>
“Arete, with arms I could drive forth the Colchians, showing grace to the
heroes for the maiden’s sake. But I fear to set at nought the righteous
judgment of Zeus. Nor is it well to take no thought of Aeetes, as thou sayest:
for none is more lordly than Aeetes. And, if he willed, he might bring war upon
Hellas, though he dwell afar. Wherefore it is right for me to deliver the
judgement that in all men’s eyes shall be best; and I will not hide it
from thee. If she be yet a maid I decree that they carry her back to her
father; but if she shares a husband’s bed, I will not separate her from
her lord; nor, if she bear a child beneath her breast, will I give it up to an
enemy.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, and at once sleep laid him to rest. And she stored up in her
heart the word of wisdom, and straightway rose from her couch and went through
the palace; and her handmaids came hasting together, eagerly tending their
mistress. But quietly she summoned her herald and addressed him, in her
prudence urging Aeson’s son to wed the maiden, and not to implore
Alcinous; for he himself, she said, will decree to the Colchians that if she is
still a maid he will deliver her up to be borne to her father’s house,
but that if she shares a husband’s bed he will not sever her from wedded
love.
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake, and quickly from the hall his feet bore him, that he might
declare to Jason the fair-omened speech of Arete and the counsel of godfearing
Alcinous. And he found the heroes watching in full armour in the haven of
Hyllus, near the city; and out he spake the whole message; and each
hero’s heart rejoiced; for the word that he spake was welcome.
</p>
<p>
And straightway they mingled a bowl to the blessed ones, as is right, and
reverently led sheep to the altar, and for that very night prepared for the
maiden the bridal couch in the sacred cave, where once dwelt Macris, the
daughter of Aristaeus, lord of honey, who discovered the works of bees and the
fatness of the olive, the fruit of labour. She it was that first received in
her bosom the Nysean son of Zeus in Abantian Euboea, and with honey moistened
his parched lips when Hermes bore him out of the flame. And Hera beheld it, and
in wrath drove her from the whole island. And she accordingly came to dwell far
off, in the sacred cave of the Phaeacians, and granted boundless wealth to the
inhabitants. There at that time did they spread a mighty couch; and thereon
they laid the glittering fleece of gold, that so the marriage might be made
honoured and the theme of song. And for them nymphs gathered flowers of varied
hue and bore them thither in their white bosoms; and a splendour as of flame
played round them all, such a light gleamed from the golden tufts. And in their
eyes it kindled a sweet longing; yet for all her desire, awe withheld each one
from laying her hand thereon. Some were called daughters of the river Aegaeus;
others dwelt round the crests of the Meliteian mount; and others were woodland
nymphs from the plains. For Hera herself, the spouse of Zeus, had sent them to
do honour to Jason. That cave is to this day called the sacred cave of Medea,
where they spread the fine and fragrant linen and brought these two together.
And the heroes in their hands wielded their spears for war, lest first a host
of foes should burst upon them for battle unawares, and, their heads enwreathed
with leafy sprays, all in harmony, while Orpheus’ harp rang clear, sang
the marriage song at the entrance to the bridal chamber. Yet not in the house
of Alcinous was the hero, Aeson’s son, minded to complete his marriage,
but in his father’s hall when he had returned home to Ioleus; and such
was the mind of Medea herself; but necessity led them to wed at this time. For
never in truth do we tribes of woe-stricken mortals tread the path of delight
with sure foot; but still some bitter affliction keeps pace with our joy.
Wherefore they too, though their souls were melted with sweet love, were held
by fear, whether the sentence of Alcinous would be fulfilled.
</p>
<p>
Now dawn returning with her beams divine scattered the gloomy night through the
sky; and the island beaches laughed out and the paths over the plains far off,
drenched with dew, and there was a din in the streets; the people were astir
throughout the city, and far away the Colchians were astir at the bounds of the
isle of Macris. And straightway to them went Alcinous, by reason of his
covenant, to declare his purpose concerning the maiden, and in his hand he held
a golden staff, his staff of justice, whereby the people had righteous
judgments meted out to them throughout the city. And with him in order due and
arrayed in their harness of war went marching, band by band, the chiefs of the
Phaeacians. And from the towers came forth the women in crowds to gaze upon the
heroes; and the country folk came to meet them when they heard the news, for
Hera had sent forth a true report. And one led the chosen ram of his flock, and
another a heifer that had never toiled; and others set hard by jars of wine for
mixing; and the smoke of sacrifice leapt up far away. And women bore fine
linen, the fruit of much toil, as women will, and gifts of gold and varied
ornaments as well, such as are brought to newly-wedded brides; and they
marvelled when they saw the shapely forms and beauty of the gallant heroes, and
among them the son of Oeagrus, oft beating the ground with gleaming sandal, to
the time of his loud-ringing lyre and song. And all the nymphs together,
whenever he recalled the marriage, uplifted the lovely bridal-chant; and at
times again they sang alone as they circled in the dance, Hera, in thy honour;
for it was thou that didst put it into the heart of Arete to proclaim the wise
word of Alcinous. And as soon as he had uttered the decree of his righteous
judgement, and the completion of the marriage had been proclaimed, he took care
that thus it should abide fixed; and no deadly fear touched him nor
Aeetes’ grievous wrath, but he kept his judgement fast bound by unbroken
oaths. So when the Colchians learnt that they were beseeching in vain and he
bade them either observe his judgements or hold their ships away from his
harbours and land, then they began to dread the threats of their own king and
besought Alcinous to receive them as comrades; and there in the island long
time they dwelt with the Phaeacians, until in the course of years, the
Bacchiadae, a race sprung from Ephyra, settled
among them; and the Colchians passed to an island opposite; and thence they
were destined to reach the Ceraunian hills of the Abantes, and the Nestaeans
and Oricum; but all this was fulfilled after long ages had passed. And still
the altars which Medea built on the spot sacred to Apollo, god of shepherds,
receive yearly sacrifices in honour of the Fates and the Nymphs. And when the
Minyae departed many gifts of friendship did Alcinous bestow, and many Arete;
moreover she gave Medea twelve Phaeacian handmaids from the palace, to bear her
company. And on the seventh day they left Drepane; and at dawn came a fresh
breeze from Zeus. And onward they sped borne along by the wind’s breath.
Howbeit not yet was it ordained for the heroes to set foot on Achaea, until
they had toiled even in the furthest bounds of Libya.
</p>
<p>
Now had they left behind the gulf named after the Ambracians, now with sails
wide spread the land of the Curetes, and next in order the narrow islands with
the Echinades, and the land of Pelops was just descried; even then a baleful
blast of the north wind seized them in mid-course and swept them towards the
Libyan sea nine nights and as many days, until they came far within Syrtis,
wherefrom is no return for ships, when they are once forced into that gulf. For
on every hand are shoals, on every hand masses of seaweed from the depths; and
over them the light foam of the wave washes without noise; and there is a
stretch of sand to the dim horizon; and there moveth nothing that creeps or
flies. Here accordingly the flood-tide&mdash;for this tide often retreats from
the land and bursts back again over the beach coming on with a rush and
roar&mdash;thrust them suddenly on to the innermost shore, and but little of
the keel was left in the water. And they leapt forth from the ship, and sorrow
seized them when they gazed on the mist and the levels of vast land stretching
far like a mist and continuous into the distance; no spot for water, no path,
no steading of herdsmen did they descry afar off, but all the scene was
possessed by a dead calm. And thus did one hero, vexed in spirit, ask another:
</p>
<p>
“What land is this? Whither has the tempest hurled us? Would that,
reckless of deadly fear, we had dared to rush on by that same path between the
clashing rocks! Better were it to have overleapt the will of Zeus and perished
in venturing some mighty deed. But now what should we do, held back by the
winds to stay here, if ever so short a time? How desolate looms before us the
edge of the limitless land!”
</p>
<p>
Thus one spake; and among them Ancaeus the helmsman, in despair at their evil
case, spoke with grieving heart: “Verily we are undone by a terrible
doom; there is no escape from ruin; we must suffer the cruellest woes, having
fallen on this desolation, even though breezes should blow from the land; for,
as I gaze far around, on every side do I behold a sea of shoals, and masses of
water, fretted line upon line, run over the hoary sand. And miserably long ago
would our sacred ship have been shattered far from the shore; but the tide
itself bore her high on to the land from the deep sea. But now the tide rushes
back to the sea, and only the foam, whereon no ship can sail, rolls round us,
just covering the land. Wherefore I deem that all hope of our voyage and of our
return is cut off. Let someone else show his skill; let him sit at the helm the
man that is eager for our deliverance. But Zeus has no will to fulfil our day
of return after all our toils.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake with tears, and all of them that had knowledge of ships agreed
thereto; but the hearts of all grew numb, and pallor overspread their cheeks.
And as, like lifeless spectres, men roam through a city awaiting the issue of
war or of pestilence, or some mighty storm which overwhelms the countless
labours of oxen, when the images of their own accord sweat and run down with
blood, and bellowings are heard in temples, or when at mid-day the sun draws on
night from heaven, and the stars shine clear through the mist; so at that time
along the endless strand the chieftains wandered, groping their way. Then
straightway dark evening came upon them; and piteously did they embrace each
other and say farewell with tears, that they might, each one apart from his
fellow, fall on the sand and die. And this way and that they went further to
choose a resting-place; and they wrapped their heads in their cloaks and,
fasting and unfed, lay down all that night and the day, awaiting a piteous
death. But apart the maidens huddled together lamented beside the daughter of
Aeetes. And as when, forsaken by their mother, unfledged birds that have fallen
from a cleft in the rock chirp shrilly; or when by the banks of fair-flowing
Pactolus, swans raise their song, and all around the dewy meadow echoes and the
river’s fair stream; so these maidens, laying in the dust their golden
hair, all through the night wailed their piteous lament. And there all would
have parted from life without a name and unknown to mortal men, those bravest
of heroes, with their task unfulfilled; but as they pined in despair, the
heroine-nymphs, warders of Libya, had pity on them, they who once found Athena,
what time she leapt in gleaming armour from her father’s head, and bathed
her by Trito’s waters. It was noon-tide and the fiercest rays of the sun
were scorching Libya; they stood near Aeson’s son, and lightly drew the
cloak from his head. And the hero cast down his eyes and looked aside, in
reverence for the goddesses, and as he lay bewildered all alone they addressed
him openly with gentle words:
</p>
<p>
“Ill-starred one, why art thou so smitten with despair? We know how ye
went in quest of the golden fleece; we know each toil of yours, all the mighty
deeds ye wrought in your wanderings over land and sea. We are the solitary
ones, goddesses of the land, speaking with human voice, the heroines,
Libya’s warders and daughters. Up then; be not thus afflicted in thy
misery, and rouse thy comrades. And when Amphitrite has straightway loosed
Poseidon’s swift-wheeled car, then do ye pay to your mother a recompense
for all her travail when she bare you so long in her womb; and so ye may return
to the divine land of Achaea.”
</p>
<p>
Thus they spake, and with the voice vanished at once, where they stood. But
Jason sat upon the earth as he gazed around, and thus cried:
</p>
<p>
“Be gracious, noble goddesses of the desert, yet the saying about our
return I understand not clearly. Surely I will gather together my comrades and
tell them, if haply we can find some token of our escape, for the counsel of
many is better.”
</p>
<p>
He spake, and leapt to his feet, and shouted afar to his comrades, all squalid
with dust, like a lion when he roars through the woodland seeking his mate; and
far off in the mountains the glens tremble at the thunder of his voice; and the
oxen of the field and the herdsmen shudder with fear; yet to them Jason’s
voice was no whit terrible, the voice of a comrade calling to his friends. And
with looks downcast they gathered near, and hard by where the ship lay he made
them sit down in their grief and the women with them, and addressed them and
told them everything:
</p>
<p>
“Listen, friends; as I lay in my grief, three goddesses girded with
goat-skins from the neck downwards round the back and waist, like maidens,
stood over my head nigh at hand; and they uncovered me, drawing my cloak away
with light hand, and they bade me rise up myself and go and rouse you, and pay
to our mother a bounteous recompense for all her travail when she bare us so
long in her womb, when Amphitrite shall have loosed Poseidon’s
swift-wheeled car. But I cannot fully understand concerning this divine
message. They said indeed that they were heroines, Libya’s warders and
daughters; and all the toils that we endured aforetime by land and sea, all
these they declared that they knew full well. Then I saw them no more in their
place, but a mist or cloud came between and hid them from my sight.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, and all marvelled as they heard. Then was wrought for the Minyae
the strangest of portents. From the sea to the land leapt forth a monstrous
horse, of vast size, with golden mane tossing round his neck; and quickly from
his limbs he shook off abundant spray and started on his course, with feet like
the wind. And at once Peleus rejoiced and spake among the throng of his
comrades:
</p>
<p>
“I deem that Poseidon’s ear has even now been loosed by the hands
of his dear wife, and I divine that our mother is none else than our ship
herself; for surely she bare us in her womb and groans unceasingly with
grievous travailing. But with unshaken strength and untiring shoulders will we
lift her up and bear her within this country of sandy wastes, where yon
swift-footed steed has sped before. For he will not plunge beneath the earth;
and his hoof-prints, I ween, will point us to some bay above the sea.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, and the fit counsel pleased all. This is the tale the Muses
told; and I sing obedient to the Pierides, and this report have I heard most
truly; that ye, O mightiest far of the sons of kings, by your might and your
valour over the desert sands of Libya raised high aloft on your shoulders the
ship and all that ye brought therein, and bare her twelve days and nights
alike. Yet who could tell the pain and grief which they endured in that toil?
Surely they were of the blood of the immortals, such a task did they take on
them, constrained by necessity. How forward and how far they bore her gladly to
the waters of the Tritonian lake! How they strode in and set her down from
their stalwart shoulders!
</p>
<p>
Then, like raging hounds, they rushed to search for a spring; for besides their
suffering and anguish, a parching thirst lay upon them, and not in vain did
they wander; but they came to the sacred plain where Ladon, the serpent of the
land, till yesterday kept watch over the golden apples in the garden of Atlas;
and all around the nymphs, the Hesperides, were busied, chanting their lovely
song. But at that time, stricken by Heracles, he lay fallen by the trunk of the
apple-tree; only the tip of his tail was still writhing; but from his head down
his dark spine he lay lifeless; and where the arrows had left in his blood the
bitter gall of the Lernaean hydra, flies withered and died over the festering
wounds. And close at hand the Hesperides, their white arms flung over their
golden heads, lamented shrilly; and the heroes drew near suddenly; but the
maidens, at their quick approach, at once became dust and earth where they
stood. Orpheus marked the divine portent, and for his comrades addressed them
in prayer: “O divine ones, fair and kind, be gracious, O queens, whether
ye be numbered among the heavenly goddesses, or those beneath the earth, or be
called the Solitary nymphs; come, O nymphs, sacred race of Oceanus, appear
manifest to our longing eyes and show us some spring of water from the rock or
some sacred flow gushing from the earth, goddesses, wherewith we may quench the
thirst that burns us unceasingly. And if ever again we return in our voyaging
to the Achaean land, then to you among the first of goddesses with willing
hearts will we bring countless gifts, libations and banquets.”
</p>
<p>
So he spake, beseeching them with plaintive voice; and they from their station
near pitied their pain; and lo! First of all they caused grass to spring from
the earth; and above the grass rose up tall shoots, and then flourishing
saplings grew standing upright far above the earth. Hespere became a poplar and
Eretheis an elm, and Aegle a willow’s sacred trunk. And forth from these
trees their forms looked out, as clear as they were before, a marvel exceeding
great, and Aegle spake with gentle words answering their longing looks:
</p>
<p>
“Surely there has come hither a mighty succour to your toils, that most
accursed man, who robbed our guardian serpent of life and plucked the golden
apples of the goddesses and is gone; and has left bitter grief for us. For
yesterday came a man most fell in wanton violence, most grim in form; and his
eyes flashed beneath his scowling brow; a ruthless wretch; and he was clad in
the skin of a monstrous lion of raw hide, untanned; and he bare a sturdy bow of
olive, and a bow, wherewith he shot and killed this monster here. So he too
came, as one traversing the land on foot, parched with thirst; and he rushed
wildly through this spot, searching for water, but nowhere was he like to see
it. Now here stood a rock near the Tritonian lake; and of his own device, or by
the prompting of some god, he smote it below with his foot; and the water
gushed out in full flow. And he, leaning both his hands and chest upon the
ground, drank a huge draught from the rifted rock, until, stooping like a beast
of the field, he had satisfied his mighty maw.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake; and they gladly with joyful steps ran to the spot where Aegle
had pointed out to them the spring, until they reached it. And as when
earth-burrowing ants gather in swarms round a narrow cleft, or when flies
lighting upon a tiny drop of sweet honey cluster round with insatiate
eagerness; so at that time, huddled together, the Minyae thronged about the
spring from the rock. And thus with wet lips one cried to another in his
delight:
</p>
<p>
“Strange! In very truth Heracles, though far away, has saved his
comrades, fordone with thirst. Would that we might find him on his way as we
pass through the mainland!”
</p>
<p>
So they spake, and those who were ready for this work answered, and they
separated this way and that, each starting to search. For by the night winds
the footsteps had been effaced where the sand was stirred. The two sons of
Boreas started up, trusting in their wings; and Euphemus, relying on his swift
feet, and Lynceus to cast far his piercing eyes; and with them darted off
Canthus, the fifth. He was urged on by the doom of the gods and his own
courage, that he might learn for certain from Heracles where he had left
Polyphemus, son of Eilatus; for he was minded to question him on every point
concerning his comrade. But that hero had founded a glorious city among the
Mysians, and, yearning for his home-return, had passed far over the mainland in
search of Argo; and in time he reached the land of the Chalybes, who dwell near
the sea; there it was that his fate subdued him. And to him a monument stands
under a tall poplar, just facing the sea. But that day Lynceus thought he saw
Heracles all alone, far off, over measureless land, as a man at the
month’s beginning sees, or thinks he sees, the moon through a bank of
cloud. And he returned and told his comrades that no other searcher would find
Heracles on his way, and they also came back, and swift-footed Euphemus and the
twin sons of Thracian Boreas, after a vain toil.
</p>
<p>
But thee, Canthus, the fates of death seized in Libya. On pasturing flocks
didst thou light; and there followed a shepherd who, in defence of his own
sheep, while thou weft leading them off to thy
comrades in their need, slew thee by the cast of a stone; for he was no
weakling, Caphaurus, the grandson of Lycoreian Phoebus and the chaste maiden
Acacallis, whom once Minos drove from home to dwell in Libya, his own daughter,
when she was bearing the gods’ heavy load; and she bare to Phoebus a
glorious son, whom they call Amphithemis and Garamas. And Amphithemis wedded a
Tritonian nymph; and she bare to him Nasamon and strong Caphaurus, who on that
day in defending his sheep slew Canthus. But he escaped not the
chieftains’ avenging hands, when they learned the deed he had done. And
the Minyae, when they knew it, afterwards took up the corpse and buried it in
the earth, mourning; and the sheep they took with them.
</p>
<p>
Thereupon on the same day a pitiless fate seized Mopsus too, son of Ampycus;
and he escaped not a bitter doom by his prophesying; for there is no averting
of death. Now there lay in the sand, avoiding the midday heat, a dread serpent,
too sluggish of his own will to strike at an unwilling foe, nor yet would he
dart full face at one that would shrink back. But into whatever of all living
beings that life-giving earth sustains that serpent once injects his black
venom, his path to Hades becomes not so much as a cubit’s length, not
even if Paeeon, if it is right for me to say this openly, should tend him, when
its teeth have only grazed the skin. For when over Libya flew godlike Perseus
Eurymedon for by that name his mother called him&mdash;bearing to the king the
Gorgon’s head newly severed, all the drops of dark blood that fell to the
earth, produced a brood of those serpents. Now Mopsus stepped on the end of its
spine, setting thereon the sole of his left foot; and it writhed round in pain
and bit and tore the flesh between the shin and the muscles. And Medea and her
handmaids fled in terror; but Mopsus bravely felt the bleeding wound; for no
excessive pain harassed him. Poor wretch! Already a numbness that loosed his
limbs was stealing beneath his skin, and a thick mist was spreading over his
eyes. Straightway his heavy limbs sank helplessly to the ground and he grew
cold; and his comrades and the hero, Aeson’s son, gathered round,
marvelling at the close-coming doom. Nor yet though dead might he lie beneath
the sun even for a little space. For at once the poison began to rot his flesh
within, and the hair decayed and fell from the skin. And quickly and in haste
they dug a deep grave with mattocks of bronze; and they tore their hair, the
heroes and the maidens, bewailing the dead man’s piteous suffering; and
when he had received due burial rites, thrice they marched round the tomb in
full armour, and heaped above him a mound of earth.
</p>
<p>
But when they had gone aboard, as the south wind blew over the sea, and they
were searching for a passage to go forth from the Tritonian lake, for long they
had no device, but all the day were borne on aimlessly. And as a serpent goes
writhing along his crooked path when the sun’s fiercest rays scorch him;
and with a hiss he turns his head to this side and that, and in his fury his
eyes glow like sparks of fire, until he creeps to his lair through a cleft in
the rock; so Argo seeking an outlet from the lake, a fairway for ships,
wandered for a long time. Then straightway Orpheus bade them bring forth from
the ship Apollo’s massy tripod and offer it to the gods of the land as
propitiation for their return. So they went forth and set Apollo’s gift
on the shore; then before them stood, in the form of a youth, farswaying
Triton, and he lifted a clod from the earth and offered it as a
stranger’s gift, and thus spake:
</p>
<p>
“Take it, friends, for no stranger’s gift of great worth have I
here by me now to place in the hands of those who beseech me. But if ye are
searching for a passage through this sea, as often is the need of men passing
through a strange land, I will declare it. For my sire Poseidon has made me to
be well versed in this sea. And I rule the shore if haply in your distant land
you have ever heard of Eurypylus, born in Libya, the home of wild
beasts.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, and readily Euphemus held out his hands towards the clod, and
thus addressed him in reply:
</p>
<p>
“If haply, hero, thou knowest aught of Apis and the
sea of Minos, tell us truly, who ask it of you. For not of our will have we
come hither, but by the stress of heavy storms have we touched the borders of
this land, and have borne our ship aloft on our shoulders to the waters of this
lake over the mainland, grievously burdened; and we know not where a passage
shows itself for our course to the land of Pelops.”
</p>
<p>
So he spake; and Triton stretched out his hand and showed afar the sea and the
lake’s deep mouth, and then addressed them: “That is the outlet to
the sea, where the deep water lies unmoved and dark; on each side roll white
breakers with shining crests; and the way between for your passage out is
narrow. And that sea stretches away in mist to the divine land of Pelops beyond
Crete; but hold to the right, when ye have entered the swell of the sea from
the lake, and steer your course hugging the land, as long as it trends to the
north; but when the coast bends, falling away in the other direction, then your
course is safely laid for you if ye go straight forward from the projecting
cape. But go in joy, and as for labour let there be no grieving that limbs in
youthful vigour should still toil.”
</p>
<p>
He spake with kindly counsel; and they at once went aboard, intent to come
forth from the lake by the use of oars. And eagerly they sped on; meanwhile
Triton took up the mighty tripod, and they saw him enter the lake; but
thereafter did no one mark how he vanished so near them along with the tripod.
But their hearts were cheered, for that one of the blessed had met them in
friendly guise. And they bade Aeson’s son offer to him the choicest of
the sheep and when he had slain it chant the hymn of praise. And straightway he
chose in haste and raising the victim slew it over the stern, and prayed with
these words:
</p>
<p>
“Thou god, who hast manifested thyself on the borders of this land,
whether the daughters born of the sea call thee Triton, the great sea-marvel,
or Phoreys, or Nereus, be gracious, and grant the return home dear to our
hearts.”
</p>
<p>
He spake, and cut the victim’s throat over the water and cast it from the
stern. And the god rose up from the depths in form such as he really was. And
as when a man trains a swift steed for the broad race-course, and runs along,
grasping the bushy mane, while the steed follows obeying his master, and rears
his neck aloft in his pride, and the gleaming bit rings loud as he champs it in
his jaws from side to side; so the god, seizing hollow Argo’s keel,
guided her onward to the sea. And his body, from the crown of his head, round
his back and waist as far as the belly, was wondrously like that of the blessed
ones in form; but below his sides the tail of a sea monster lengthened far,
forking to this side and that; and he smote the surface of the waves with the
spines, which below parted into curving fins, like the horns of the new moon.
And he guided Argo on until he sped her into the sea on her course; and quickly
he plunged into the vast abyss; and the heroes shouted when they gazed with
their eyes on that dread portent. There is the harbour of Argo and there are
the signs of her stay, and altars to Poseidon and Triton; for during that day
they tarried. But at dawn with sails outspread they sped on before the breath
of the west wind, keeping the desert land on their right. And on the next morn
they saw the headland and the recess of the sea, bending inward beyond the
jutting headland. And straightway the west wind ceased, and there came the
breeze of the clear south wind; and their hearts rejoiced at the sound it made.
But when the sun sank and the star returned that bids the shepherd fold, which
brings rest to wearied ploughmen, at that time the wind died down in the dark
night; so they furled the sails and lowered the tall mast and vigorously plied
their polished oars all night and through the day, and again when the next
night came on. And rugged Carpathus far away welcomed them; and thence they
were to cross to Crete, which rises in the sea above other islands.
</p>
<p>
And Talos, the man of bronze, as he broke off rocks from the hard cliff, stayed
them from fastening hawsers to the shore, when they came to the roadstead of
Dicte’s haven. He was of the stock of bronze, of the men sprung from
ash-trees, the last left among the sons of the gods; and the son of Cronos gave
him to Europa to be the warder of Crete and to stride round the island thrice a
day with his feet of bronze. Now in all the rest of his body and limbs was he
fashioned of bronze and invulnerable; but beneath the sinew by his ankle was a
blood-red vein; and this, with its issues of life and death, was covered by a
thin skin. So the heroes, though outworn with toil, quickly backed their ship
from the land in sore dismay. And now far from Crete would they have been borne
in wretched plight, distressed both by thirst and pain, had not Medea addressed
them as they turned away:
</p>
<p>
“Hearken to me. For I deem that I alone can subdue for you that man,
whoever he be, even though his frame be of bronze throughout, unless his life
too is everlasting. But be ready to keep your ship here beyond the cast of his
stones, till he yield the victory to me.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake; and they drew the ship out of range, resting on their oars,
waiting to see what plan unlooked for she would bring to pass; and she, holding
the fold of her purple robe over her cheeks on each side, mounted on the deck;
and Aeson’s son took her hand in his and guided her way along the
thwarts. And with songs did she propitiate and invoke the Death-spirits,
devourers of life, the swift hounds of Hades, who, hovering through all the
air, swoop down on the living. Kneeling in supplication, thrice she called on
them with songs, and thrice with prayers; and, shaping her soul to mischief,
with her hostile glance she bewitched the eyes of Talos, the man of bronze; and
her teeth gnashed bitter wrath against him, and she sent forth baneful phantoms
in the frenzy of her rage.
</p>
<p>
Father Zeus, surely great wonder rises in my mind, seeing that dire destruction
meets us not from disease and wounds alone, but lo! even from afar, may be, it
tortures us! So Talos, for all his frame of bronze, yielded the victory to the
might of Medea the sorceress. And as he was heaving massy rocks to stay them
from reaching the haven, he grazed his ankle on a pointed crag; and the ichor
gushed forth like melted lead; and not long thereafter did he stand towering on
the jutting cliff. But even as some huge pine, high up on the mountains, which
woodmen have left half hewn through by their sharp axes when they returned from
the forest&mdash;at first it shivers in the wind by night, then at last snaps
at the stump and crashes down; so Talos for a while stood on his tireless feet,
swaying to and fro, when at last, all strengthless, fell with a mighty thud.
For that night there in Crete the heroes lay; then, just as dawn was growing
bright, they built a shrine to Minoan Athena, and drew water and went aboard,
so that first of all they might by rowing pass beyond Salmone’s height.
</p>
<p>
But straightway as they sped over the wide Cretan sea night scared them, that
night which they name the Pall of Darkness; the stars pierced not that fatal
night nor the beams of the moon, but black chaos descended from heaven, or
haply some other darkness came, rising from the nethermost depths. And the
heroes, whether they drifted in Hades or on the waters, knew not one whit; but
they committed their return to the sea in helpless doubt whither it was bearing
them. But Jason raised his hands and cried to Phoebus with mighty voice,
calling on him to save them; and the tears ran down in his distress; and often
did he promise to bring countless offerings to Pytho, to Amyclae, and to
Ortygia. And quickly, O son of Leto, swift to hear, didst thou come down from
heaven to the Melantian rocks, which lie there in the sea. Then darting upon
one of the twin peaks, thou raisedst aloft in thy right hand thy golden bow;
and the bow flashed a dazzling gleam all round. And to their sight appeared a
small island of the Sporades, over against the tiny isle Hippuris, and there
they cast anchor and stayed; and straightway dawn arose and gave them light;
and they made for Apollo a glorious abode in a shady wood, and a shady altar,
calling on Phoebus the “Gleamer”, because of the gleam far-seen;
and that bare island they called Anaphe, for that
Phoebus had revealed it to men sore bewildered. And they sacrificed all that
men could provide for sacrifice on a desolate strand; wherefore when
Medea’s Phaeacian handmaids saw them pouring water for libations on the
burning brands, they could no longer restrain laughter within their bosoms, for
that ever they had seen oxen in plenty slain in the halls of Alcinous. And the
heroes delighted in the jest and attacked them with taunting words; and merry
railing and contention flung to and fro were kindled among them. And from that
sport of the heroes such scoffs do the women fling at the men in that island
whenever they propitiate with sacrifices Apollo the gleaming god, the warder of
Anaphe.
</p>
<p>
But when they had loosed the hawsers thence in fair weather, then Euphemus
bethought him of a dream of the night, reverencing the glorious son of Maia.
For it seemed to him that the god-given clod of earth held in his palm close to
his breast was being suckled by white streams of milk, and that from it, little
though it was, grew a woman like a virgin; and he, overcome by strong desire,
lay with her in love’s embrace; and united with her he pitied her, as
though she were a maiden whom he was feeding with his own milk; but she
comforted him with gentle words:
</p>
<p>
“Daughter of Triton am I, dear friend, and nurse of thy children, no
maiden; Triton and Libya are my parents. But restore me to the daughters of
Nereus to dwell in the sea near Anaphe; I shall return again to the light of
the sun, to prepare a home for thy descendants.”
</p>
<p>
Of this he stored in his heart the memory, and declared it to Aeson’s
son; and Jason pondered a prophecy of the Far-Darter and lifted up his voice
and said:
</p>
<p>
“My friend, great and glorious renown has fallen to thy lot. For of this
clod when thou hast cast it into the sea, the gods will make an island, where
thy children’s children shall dwell; for Triton gave this to thee as a
stranger’s gift from the Libyan mainland. None other of the immortals it
was than he that gave thee this when he met thee.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake; and Euphemus made not vain the answer of Aeson’s son; but,
cheered by the prophecy, he cast the clod into the depths. Therefrom rose up an
island, Calliste, sacred nurse of the sons of Euphemus, who in former days
dwelt in Sintian Lemnos, and from Lemnos were driven forth by Tyrrhenians and
came to Sparta as suppliants; and when they left Sparta, Theras, the goodly son
of Autesion, brought them to the island Calliste, and from himself he gave it
the name of Thera. But this befell after the days of Euphemus.
</p>
<p>
And thence they steadily left behind long leagues of sea and stayed on the
beach of Aegina; and at once they contended in innocent strife about the
fetching of water, who first should draw it and reach the ship. For both their
need and the ceaseless breeze urged them on. There even to this day do the
youths of the Myrmidons take up on their shoulders full-brimming jars, and with
swift feet strive for victory in the race.
</p>
<p>
Be gracious, race of blessed chieftains! And may these songs year after year be
sweeter to sing among men. For now have I come to the glorious end of your
toils; for no adventure befell you as ye came home from Aegina, and no tempest
of winds opposed you; but quietly did ye skirt the Cecropian land and Aulis
inside of Euboea and the Opuntian cities of the Locrians, and gladly did ye
step forth upon the beach of Pagasae.

<h1>Argonautica</h1>
<h2>by Apollonius of Rhodes</h2>
<h3>Book III</h3>
<p>
Come now, Erato, stand by my side, and say next how Jason brought back the
fleece to Iolcus aided by the love of Medea. For thou sharest the power of
Cypris, and by thy love-cares dost charm unwedded maidens; wherefore to thee
too is attached a name that tells of love.
</p>
<p>
Thus the heroes, unobserved, were waiting in ambush amid the thick reed-beds;
but Hera and Athena took note of them, and, apart from Zeus and the other
immortals, entered a chamber and took counsel together; and Hera first made
trial of Athena:
</p>
<p>
“Do thou now first, daughter of Zeus, give advice. What must be done?
Wilt thou devise some scheme whereby they may seize the golden fleece of Aeetes
and bear it to Hellas, or can they deceive the king with soft words and so work
persuasion? Of a truth he is terribly overweening. Still it is right to shrink
from no endeavour.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake, and at once Athena addressed her: “I too was pondering
such thoughts in my heart, Hera, when thou didst ask me outright. But not yet
do I think that I have conceived a scheme to aid the courage of the heroes,
though I have balanced many plans.”
</p>
<p>
She ended, and the goddesses fixed their eyes on the ground at their feet,
brooding apart; and straightway Hera was the first to speak her thought:
“Come, let us go to Cypris; let both of us accost her and urge her to bid
her son (if only he will obey) speed his shaft at the daughter of Aeetes, the
enchantress, and charm her with love for Jason. And I deem that by her device
he will bring back the fleece to Hellas.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake, and the prudent plan pleased Athena, and she addressed her in
reply with gentle words:
</p>
<p>
“Hera, my father begat me to be a stranger to the darts of love, nor do I
know any charm to work desire. But if the word pleases thee, surely I will
follow; but thou must speak when we meet her.”
</p>
<p>
So she said, and starting forth they came to the mighty palace of Cypris, which
her husband, the halt-footed god, had built for her when first he brought her
from Zeus to be his wife. And entering the court they stood beneath the gallery
of the chamber where the goddess prepared the couch of Hephaestus. But he had
gone early to his forge and anvils to a broad cavern in a floating island where
with the blast of flame he wrought all manner of curious work; and she all
alone was sitting within, on an inlaid seat facing the door. And her white
shoulders on each side were covered with the mantle of her hair and she was
parting it with a golden comb and about to braid up the long tresses; but when
she saw the goddesses before her, she stayed and called them within, and rose
from her seat and placed them on couches. Then she herself sat down, and with
her hands gathered up the locks still uncombed. And smiling she addressed them
with crafty words:
</p>
<p>
“Good friends, what intent, what occasion brings you here after so long?
Why have ye come, not too frequent visitors before, chief among goddesses that
ye are?”
</p>
<p>
And to her Hera replied: “Thou dost mock us, but our hearts are stirred
with calamity. For already on the river Phasis the son of Aeson moors his ship,
he and his comrades in quest of the fleece. For all their sakes we fear
terribly (for the task is nigh at hand) but most for Aeson’s son. Him
will I deliver, though he sail even to Hades to free Ixion below from his
brazen chains, as far as strength lies in my limbs, so that Pelias may not mock
at having escaped an evil doom&mdash;Pelias who left me unhonoured with
sacrifice. Moreover Jason was greatly loved by me before, ever since at the
mouth of Anaurus in flood, as I was making trial of men’s righteousness,
he met me on his return from the chase; and all the mountains and long ridged
peaks were sprinkled with snow, and from them the torrents rolling down were
rushing with a roar. And he took pity on me in the likeness of an old crone,
and raising me on his shoulders himself bore me through the headlong tide. So
he is honoured by me unceasingly; nor will Pelias pay the penalty of his
outrage, unless thou wilt grant Jason his return.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake, and speechlessness seized Cypris. And beholding Hera
supplicating her she felt awe, and then addressed her with friendly words:
“Dread goddess, may no viler thing than Cypris ever be found, if I
disregard thy eager desire in word or deed, whatever my weak arms can effect;
and let there be no favour in return.”
</p>
<p>
She spake, and Hera again addressed her with prudence: “It is not in need
of might or of strength that we have come. But just quietly bid thy boy charm
Aeetes’ daughter with love for Jason. For if she will aid him with her
kindly counsel, easily do I think he will win the fleece of gold and return to
Iolcus, for she is full of wiles.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake, and Cypris addressed them both: “Hera and Athena, he will
obey you rather than me. For unabashed though he is, there will be some slight
shame in his eyes before you; but he has no respect for me, but ever slights me
in contentious mood. And, overborne by his naughtiness, I purpose to break his
ill-sounding arrows and his bow in his very sight. For in his anger he has
threatened that if I shall not keep my hands off him while he still masters his
temper, I shall have cause to blame myself thereafter.”
</p>
<p>
So she spake, and the goddesses smiled and looked at each other. But Cypris
again spoke, vexed at heart: “To others my sorrows are a jest; nor ought
I to tell them to all; I know them too well myself. But now, since this pleases
you both, I will make the attempt and coax him, and he will not say me
nay.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake, and Hera took her slender hand and gently smiling, replied:
“Perform this task, Cytherea, straightway, as thou sayest; and be not
angry or contend with thy boy; he will cease hereafter to vex thee.”
</p>
<p>
She spake, and left her seat, and Athena accompanied her and they went forth
both hastening back. And Cypris went on her way through the glens of Olympus to
find her boy. And she found him apart, in the blooming orchard of Zeus, not
alone, but with him Ganymedes, whom once Zeus had set to dwell among the
immortal gods, being enamoured of his beauty. And they were playing for golden
dice, as boys in one house are wont to do. And already greedy Eros was holding
the palm of his left hand quite full of them under his breast, standing
upright; and on the bloom of his cheeks a sweet blush was glowing. But the
other sat crouching hard by, silent and downcast, and he had two dice left
which he threw one after the other, and was angered by the loud laughter of
Eros. And lo, losing them straightway with the former, he went off empty
handed, helpless, and noticed not the approach of Cypris. And she stood before
her boy, and laying her hand on his lips, addressed him:
</p>
<p>
“Why dost thou smile in triumph, unutterable rogue? Hast thou cheated him
thus, and unjustly overcome the innocent child? Come, be ready to perform for
me the task I will tell thee of, and I will give thee Zeus’ all-beauteous
plaything&mdash;the one which his dear nurse Adrasteia made for him, while he
still lived a child, with childish ways, in the Idaean cave&mdash;a
well-rounded ball; no better toy wilt thou get from the hands of Hephaestus.
All of gold are its zones, and round each double seams run in a circle; but the
stitches are hidden, and a dark blue spiral overlays them all. But if thou
shouldst cast it with thy hands, lo, like a star, it sends a flaming track
through the sky. This I will give thee; and do thou strike with thy shaft and
charm the daughter of Aeetes with love for Jason; and let there be no
loitering. For then my thanks would be the slighter.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake, and welcome were her words to the listening boy. And he threw
down all his toys, and eagerly seizing her robe on this side and on that, clung
to the goddess. And he implored her to bestow the gift at once; but she, facing
him with kindly words, touched his cheeks, kissed him and drew him to her, and
replied with a smile:
</p>
<p>
“Be witness now thy dear head and mine, that surely I will give thee the
gift and deceive thee not, if thou wilt strike with thy shaft Aeetes’
daughter.”
</p>
<p>
She spoke, and he gathered up his dice, and having well counted them all threw
them into his mother’s gleaming lap. And straightway with golden baldric
he slung round him his quiver from where it leant against a tree-trunk, and
took up his curved bow. And he fared forth through the fruitful orchard of the
palace of Zeus. Then he passed through the gates of Olympus high in air; hence
is a downward path from heaven; and the twin poles rear aloft steep mountain
tops the highest crests of earth, where the risen sun grows ruddy with his
first beams. And beneath him there appeared now the life-giving earth and
cities of men and sacred streams of rivers, and now in turn mountain peaks and
the ocean all around, as he swept through the vast expanse of air.
</p>
<p>
Now the heroes apart in ambush, in a back-water of the river, were met in
council, sitting on the benches of their ship. And Aeson’s son himself
was speaking among them; and they were listening silently in their places
sitting row upon row: “My friends, what pleases myself that will I say
out; it is for you to bring about its fulfilment. For in common is our task,
and common to all alike is the right of speech; and he who in silence withholds
his thought and his counsel, let him know that it is he alone that bereaves
this band of its home-return. Do ye others rest here in the ship quietly with
your arms; but I will go to the palace of Aeetes, taking with me the sons of
Phrixus and two comrades as well. And when I meet him I will first make trial
with words to see if he will be willing to give up the golden fleece for
friendship’s sake or not, but trusting to his might will set at nought
our quest. For so, learning his frowardness first from himself, we will
consider whether we shall meet him in battle, or some other plan shall avail
us, if we refrain from the war-cry. And let us not merely by force, before
putting words to the test, deprive him of his own possession. But first it is
better to go to him and win his favour by speech. Oftentimes, I ween, does
speech accomplish at need what prowess could hardly catty through, smoothing
the path in manner befitting. And he once welcomed noble Phrixus, a fugitive
from his stepmother’s wiles and the sacrifice prepared by his father. For
all men everywhere, even the most shameless, reverence the ordinance of Zeus,
god of strangers, and regard it.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, and the youths approved the words of Aeson’s son with one
accord, nor was there one to counsel otherwise. And then he summoned to go with
him the sons of Phrixus, and Telamon and Augeias; and himself took
Hermes’ wand; and at once they passed forth from the ship beyond the
reeds and the water to dry land, towards the rising ground of the plain. The
plain, I wis, is called Circe’s; and here in line grow many willows and
osiers, on whose topmost branches hang corpses bound with cords. For even now
it is an abomination with the Colchians to burn dead men with fire; nor is it
lawful to place them in the earth and raise a mound above, but to wrap them in
untanned oxhides and suspend them from trees far from the city. And so earth
has an equal portion with air, seeing that they bury the women; for that is the
custom of their land.
</p>
<p>
And as they went Hera with friendly thought spread a thick mist through the
city, that they might fare to the palace of Aeetes unseen by the countless
hosts of the Colchians. But soon when from the plain they came to the city and
Aeetes’ palace, then again Hera dispersed the mist. And they stood at the
entrance, marvelling at the king’s courts and the wide gates and columns
which rose in ordered lines round the walls; and high up on the palace a coping
of stone rested on brazen triglyphs. And silently they crossed the threshold.
And close by garden vines covered with green foliage were in full bloom, lifted
high in air. And beneath them ran four fountains, ever-flowing, which
Hephaestus had delved out. One was gushing with milk, one with wine, while the
third flowed with fragrant oil; and the fourth ran with water, which grew warm
at the setting of the Pleiads, and in turn at their rising bubbled forth from
the hollow rock, cold as crystal. Such then were the wondrous works that the
craftsman-god Hephaestus had fashioned in the palace of Cytaean Aeetes. And he
wrought for him bulls with feet of bronze, and their mouths were of bronze, and
from them they breathed out a terrible flame of fire; moreover he forged a
plough of unbending adamant, all in one piece, in payment of thanks to Helios,
who had taken the god up in his chariot when faint from the Phlegraean fight. And here an inner-court was built, and
round it were many well-fitted doors and chambers here and there, and all along
on each side was a richly-wrought gallery. And on both sides loftier buildings
stood obliquely. In one, which was the loftiest, lordly Aeetes dwelt with his
queen; and in another dwelt Apsyrtus, son of Aeetes, whom a Caucasian nymph,
Asterodeia, bare before he made Eidyia his wedded wife, the youngest daughter
of Tethys and Oceanus. And the sons of the Colchians called him by the new name
of Phaethon, because he outshone all the youths. The
other buildings the handmaidens had, and the two daughters of Aeetes, Chalciope
and Medea. Medea then [they found] going from chamber to chamber in search of
her sister, for Hera detained her within that day; but beforetime she was not
wont to haunt the palace, but all day long was busied in Hecate’s temple,
since she herself was the priestess of the goddess. And when she saw them she
cried aloud, and quickly Chalciope caught the sound; and her maids, throwing
down at their feet their yarn and their thread, rushed forth all in a throng.
And she, beholding her sons among them, raised her hands aloft through joy; and
so they likewise greeted their mother, and when they saw her embraced her in
their gladness; and she with many sobs spoke thus:
</p>
<p>
“After all then, ye were not destined to leave me in your heedlessness
and to wander far; but fate has turned you back. Poor wretch that I am! What a
yearning for Hellas from some woeful madness seized you at the behest of your
father Phrixus. Bitter sorrows for my heart did he ordain when dying. And why
should ye go to the city of Orchomenus, whoever this Orchomenus is, for the
sake of Athamas’ wealth, leaving your mother alone to bear her
grief?”
</p>
<p>
Such were her words; and Aeetes came forth last of all and Eidyia herself came,
the queen of Aeetes, on hearing the voice of Chalciope; and straightway all the
court was filled with a throng. Some of the thralls were busied with a mighty
bull, others with the axe were cleaving dry billets, and others heating with
fire water for the baths; nor was there one who relaxed his toil, serving the
king.
</p>
<p>
Meantime Eros passed unseen through the grey mist, causing confusion, as when
against grazing heifers rises the gadfly, which oxherds call the breese. And
quickly beneath the lintel in the porch he strung his bow and took from the
quiver an arrow unshot before, messenger of pain. And with swift feet unmarked
he passed the threshold and keenly glanced around; and gliding close by
Aeson’s son he laid the arrow-notch on the cord in the centre, and
drawing wide apart with both hands he shot at Medea; and speechless amazement
seized her soul. But the god himself flashed back again from the high-roofed
hall, laughing loud; and the bolt burnt deep down in the maiden’s heart
like a flame; and ever she kept darting bright glances straight up at
Aeson’s son, and within her breast her heart panted fast through anguish,
all remembrance left her, and her soul melted with the sweet pain. And as a
poor woman heaps dry twigs round a blazing brand&mdash;a daughter of toil,
whose task is the spinning of wool, that she may kindle a blaze at night
beneath her roof, when she has waked very early&mdash;and the flame waxing
wondrous great from the small brand consumes all the twigs together; so,
coiling round her heart, burnt secretly Love the destroyer; and the hue of her
soft cheeks went and came, now pale, now red, in her soul’s distraction.
</p>
<p>
Now when the thralls had laid a banquet ready before them, and they had
refreshed themselves with warm baths, gladly did they please their souls with
meat and drink. And thereafter Aeetes questioned the sons of his daughter,
addressing them with these words:
</p>
<p>
“Sons of my daughter and of Phrixus, whom beyond all strangers I honoured
in my halls, how have ye come returning back to Aea? Did some calamity cut
short your escape in the midst? Ye did not listen when I set before you the
boundless length of the way. For I marked it once, whirled along in the chariot
of my father Helios, when he was bringing my sister Circe to the western land
and we came to the shore of the Tyrrhenian mainland, where even now she abides,
exceeding far from Colchis. But what pleasure is there in words? Do ye tell me
plainly what has been your fortune, and who these men are, your companions, and
where from your hollow ship ye came ashore.”
</p>
<p>
Such were his questions, and Argus, before all his brethren, being fearful for
the mission of Aeson’s son, gently replied, for he was the elder-born:
</p>
<p>
“Aeetes, that ship forthwith stormy blasts tore asunder, and ourselves,
crouching on the beams, a wave drove on to the beach of the isle of Enyalius  in the murky night; and some god
preserved us. For even the birds of Ares that haunted the desert isle
beforetime, not even them did we find. But these men had driven them off,
having landed from their ship on the day before; and the will of Zeus taking
pity on us, or some fate, detained them there, since they straightway gave us
both food and clothing in abundance, when they heard the illustrious name of
Phrixus and thine own; for to thy city are they faring. And if thou dost wish
to know their errand, I will not hide it from time. A certain king, vehemently
longing to drive this man far from his fatherland and possessions, because in
might he outshone all the sons of Aeolus, sends him to voyage hither on a
bootless venture; and asserts that the stock of Aeolus will not escape the
heart-grieving wrath and rage of implacable Zeus, nor the unbearable curse and
vengeance due for Phrixus, until the fleece comes back to Hellas. And their
ship was fashioned by Pallas Athena, not such a one as are the ships among the
Colchians, on the vilest of which we chanced. For the fierce waves and wind
broke her utterly to pieces; but the other holds firm with her bolts, even
though all the blasts should buffet her. And with equal swiftness she speedeth
before the wind and when the crew ply the oar with unresting hands. And he hath
gathered in her the mightiest heroes of all Achaea, and hath come to thy city
from wandering far through cities and gulfs of the dread ocean, in the hope
that thou wilt grant him the fleece. But as thou dost please, so shall it be,
for he cometh not to use force, but is eager to pay thee a recompense for the
gift. He has heard from me of thy bitter foes the Sauromatae, and he will
subdue them to thy sway. And if thou desirest to know their names and lineage I
will tell thee all. This man on whose account the rest were gathered from
Hellas, they call Jason, son of Aeson, whom Cretheus begat. And if in truth he
is of the stock of Cretheus himself, thus he would be our kinsman on the
father’s side. For Cretheus and Athamas were both sons of Aeolus; and
Phrixus was the son of Athamas, son of Aeolus. And here, if thou hast heard at
all of the seed of Helios, thou dost behold Augeias; and this is Telamon sprung
from famous Aeacus; and Zeus himself begat Aeacus. And so all the rest, all the
comrades that follow him, are the sons or grandsons of the immortals.”
</p>
<p>
Such was the tale of Argus; but the king at his words was filled with rage as
he heard; and his heart was lifted high in wrath. And he spake in heavy
displeasure; and was angered most of all with the son of Chalciope; for he
deemed that on their account the strangers had come; and in his fury his eyes
flashed forth beneath his brows:
</p>
<p>
“Begone from my sight, felons, straightway, ye and your tricks, from the
land, ere someone see a fleece and a Phrixus to his sorrow. Banded together
with your friends from Hellas, not for the fleece, but to seize my sceptre and
royal power have ye come hither. Had ye not first tasted of my table, surely
would I have cut out your tongues and hewn off both hands and sent you forth
with your feet alone, so that ye might be stayed from starting hereafter. And
what lies have ye uttered against the blessed gods!”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake in his wrath; and mightily from its depths swelled the heart of
Aeacus’ son, and his soul within longed to speak a deadly word in
defiance, but Aeson’s son checked him, for he himself first made gentle
answer:
</p>
<p>
“Aeetes, bear with this armed band, I pray. For not in the way thou
deemest have we come to thy city and palace, no, nor yet with such desires. For
who would of his own will dare to cross so wide a sea for the goods of a
stranger? But fate and the ruthless command of a presumptuous king urged me.
Grant a favour to thy suppliants, and to all Hellas will I publish a glorious
fame of thee; yea, we are ready now to pay thee a swift recompense in war,
whether it be the Sauromatae or some other people that thou art eager to subdue
to thy sway.”
</p>
<p>
He spake, flattering him with gentle utterance; but the king’s soul
brooded a twofold purpose within him, whether he should attack and slay them on
the spot or should make trial of their might. And this, as he pondered, seemed
the better way, and he addressed Jason in answer:
</p>
<p>
“Stranger, why needest thou go through thy tale to the end? For if ye are
in truth of heavenly race, or have come in no wise inferior to me, to win the
goods of strangers, I will give thee the fleece to bear away, if thou dost
wish, when I have tried thee. For against brave men I bear no grudge, such as
ye yourselves tell me of him who bears sway in Hellas. And the trial of your
courage and might shall be a contest which I myself can compass with my hands,
deadly though it be. Two bulls with feet of bronze I have that pasture on the
plain of Ares, breathing forth flame from their jaws; them do I yoke and drive
over the stubborn field of Ares, four plough-gates; and quickly cleaving it
with the share up to the headland, I cast into the furrows the seed, not the
corn of Demeter, but the teeth of a dread serpent that grow up into the fashion
of armed men; them I slay at once, cutting them down beneath my spear as they
rise against me on all sides. In the morning do I yoke the oxen, and at
eventide I cease from the harvesting. And thou, if thou wilt accomplish such
deeds as these, on that very day shalt carry off the fleece to the king’s
palace; ere that time comes I will not give it, expect it not. For indeed it is
unseemly that a brave man should yield to a coward.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake; and Jason, fixing his eyes on the ground, sat just as he was,
speechless, helpless in his evil plight. For a long time he turned the matter
this way and that, and could in no way take on him the task with courage, for a
mighty task it seemed; and at last he made reply with crafty words:
</p>
<p>
“With thy plea of right, Aeetes, thou dost shut me in overmuch. Wherefore
also I will dare that contest, monstrous as it is, though it be my doom to die.
For nothing will fall upon men more dread than dire necessity, which indeed
constrained me to come hither at a king’s command.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, smitten by his helpless plight; and the king with grim words
addressed him, sore troubled as he was: “Go forth now to the gathering,
since thou art eager for the toil; but if thou shouldst fear to lift the yoke
upon the oxen or shrink from the deadly harvesting, then all this shall be my
care, so that another too may shudder to come to a man that is better than
he.”
</p>
<p>
He spake outright; and Jason rose from his seat, and Augeias and Telamon at
once; and Argus followed alone, for he signed to his brothers to stay there on
the spot meantime; and so they went forth from the hall. And wonderfully among
them all shone the son of Aeson for beauty and grace; and the maiden looked at
him with stealthy glance, holding her bright veil aside, her heart smouldering
with pain; and her soul creeping like a dream flitted in his track as he went.
So they passed forth from the palace sorely troubled. And Chalciope, shielding
herself from the wrath of Aeetes, had gone quickly to her chamber with her
sons. And Medea likewise followed, and much she brooded in her soul all the
cares that the Loves awaken. And before her eyes the vision still
appeared&mdash;himself what like he was, with what vesture he was clad, what
things he spake, how he sat on his seat, how he moved forth to the
door&mdash;and as she pondered she deemed there never was such another man; and
ever in her ears rung his voice and the honey-sweet words which he uttered. And
she feared for him, lest the oxen or Aeetes with his own hand should slay him;
and she mourned him as though already slain outright, and in her affliction a
round tear through very grievous pity coursed down her cheek; and gently
weeping she lifted up her voice aloud:
</p>
<p>
“Why does this grief come upon me, poor wretch? Whether he be the best of
heroes now about to perish, or the worst, let him go to his doom. Yet I would
that he had escaped unharmed; yea, may this be so, revered goddess, daughter of
Perses, may he avoid death and return home; but if it be his lot to be
o’ermastered by the oxen, may he first learn this, that I at least do not
rejoice in his cruel calamity.”
</p>
<p>
Thus then was the maiden’s heart racked by love-cares. But when the
others had gone forth from the people and the city, along the path by which at
the first they had come from the plain, then Argus addressed Jason with these
words:
</p>
<p>
“Son of Aeson, thou wilt despise the counsel which I will tell thee, but,
though in evil plight, it is not fitting to forbear from the trial. Ere now
thou hast heard me tell of a maiden that uses sorcery under the guidance of
Hecate, Perses’ daughter. If we could win her aid there will be no dread,
methinks, of thy defeat in the contest; but terribly do I fear that my mother
will not take this task upon her. Nevertheless I will go back again to entreat
her, for a common destruction overhangs us all.”
</p>
<p>
He spake with goodwill, and Jason answered with these words: “Good
friend, if this is good in thy sight, I say not nay. Go and move thy mother,
beseeching her aid with prudent words; pitiful indeed is our hope when we have
put our return in the keeping of women.” So he spake, and quickly they
reached the back-water. And their comrades joyfully questioned them, when they
saw them close at hand; and to them spoke Aeson’s son grieved at heart:
</p>
<p>
“My friends, the heart of ruthless Aeetes is utterly filled with wrath
against us, for not at all can the goal be reached either by me or by you who
question me. He said that two bulls with feet of bronze pasture on the plain of
Ares, breathing forth flame from their jaws. And with these he bade me plough
the field, four plough-gates; and said that he would give me from a
serpent’s jaws seed which will raise up earthborn men in armour of
bronze; and on the same day I must slay them. This task&mdash;for there was
nothing better to devise&mdash;I took on myself outright.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake; and to all the contest seemed one that none could accomplish,
and long, quiet and silent, they looked at one another, bowed down with the
calamity and their despair; but at last Peleus spake with courageous words
among all the chiefs: “It is time to be counselling what we shall do. Yet
there is not so much profit, I trow, in counsel as in the might of our hands.
If thou then, hero son of Aeson, art minded to yoke Aeetes’ oxen, and art
eager for the toil, surely thou wilt keep thy promise and make thyself ready.
But if thy soul trusts not her prowess utterly, then neither bestir thyself nor
sit still and look round for some one else of these men. For it is not I who
will flinch, since the bitterest pain will be but death.”
</p>
<p>
So spake the son of Aeacus; and Telamon’s soul was stirred, and quickly
he started up in eagerness; and Idas rose up the third in his pride; and the
twin sons of Tyndareus; and with them Oeneus’ son who was numbered among
strong men, though even the soft down on his cheek showed not yet; with such
courage was his soul uplifted. But the others gave way to these in silence. And
straightway Argus spake these words to those that longed for the contest:
</p>
<p>
“My friends, this indeed is left us at the last. But I deem that there
will come to you some timely aid from my mother. Wherefore, eager though ye be,
refrain and abide in your ship a little longer as before, for it is better to
forbear than recklessly to choose an evil fate. There is a maiden, nurtured in
the halls of Aeetes, whom the goddess Hecate taught to handle magic herbs with
exceeding skill all that the land and flowing waters produce. With them is
quenched the blast of unwearied flame, and at once she stays the course of
rivers as they rush roaring on, and checks the stars and the paths of the
sacred moon. Of her we bethought us as we came hither along the path from the
palace, if haply my mother, her own sister, might persuade her to aid us in the
venture. And if this is pleasing to you as well, surely on this very day will I
return to the palace of Aeetes to make trial; and perchance with some
god’s help shall I make the trial.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, and the gods in their goodwill gave them a sign. A trembling
dove in her flight from a mighty hawk fell from on high, terrified, into the
lap of Aeson’s son, and the hawk fell impaled on the stern-ornament. And
quickly Mopsus with prophetic words spake among them all:
</p>
<p>
“For you, friends, this sign has been wrought by the will of heaven; in
no other way is it possible to interpret its meaning better, than to seek out
the maiden and entreat her with manifold skill. And I think she will not reject
our prayer, if in truth Phineus said that our return should be with the help of
the Cyprian goddess. It was her gentle bird that escaped death; and as my heart
within me foresees according to this omen, so may it prove! But, my friends,
let us call on Cytherea to aid us, and now at once obey the counsels of
Argus.”
</p>
<p>
He spake, and the warriors approved, remembering the injunctions of Phineus;
but all alone leapt up Apharcian Idas and shouted loudly in terrible wrath:
“Shame on us, have we come here fellow voyagers with women, calling on
Cypris for help and not on the mighty strength of Enyalius? And do ye look to
doves and hawks to save yourselves from contests? Away with you, take thought
not for deeds of war, but by supplication to beguile weakling girls.”
</p>
<p>
Such were his eager words; and of his comrades many murmured low, but none
uttered a word of answer back. And he sat down in wrath; and at once Jason
roused them and uttered his own thought: “Let Argus set forth from the
ship, since this pleases all; but we will now move from the river and openly
fasten our hawsers to the shore. For surely it is not fitting for us to hide
any longer cowering from the battle-cry.”
</p>
<p>
So he spake, and straightway sent Argus to return in haste to the city; and
they drew the anchors on board at the command of Aeson’s son, and rowed
the ship close to the shore, a little away from the back-water.
</p>
<p>
But straightway Aeetes held an assembly of the Colchians far aloof from his
palace at a spot where they sat in times before, to devise against the Minyae
grim treachery and troubles. And he threatened that when first the oxen should
have torn in pieces the man who had taken upon him to perform the heavy task,
he would hew down the oak grove above the wooded hill, and burn the ship and
her crew, that so they might vent forth in ruin their grievous insolence, for
all their haughty schemes. For never would he have welcomed the Aeolid Phrixus
as a guest in his halls, in spite of his sore need, Phrixus, who surpassed all
strangers in gentleness and fear of the gods, had not Zeus himself sent Hermes
his messenger down from heaven, so that he might meet with a friendly host;
much less would pirates coming to his land be let go scatheless for long, men
whose care it was to lift their hands and seize the goods of others, and to
weave secret webs of guile, and harry the steadings of herdsmen with
ill-sounding forays. And he said that besides all that the sons of Phrixus
should pay a fitting penalty to himself for returning in consort with
evildoers, that they might recklessly drive him from his honour and his throne;
for once he had heard a baleful prophecy from his father Helios, that he must
avoid the secret treachery and schemes of his own offspring and their crafty
mischief. Wherefore he was sending them, as they desired, to the Achaean land
at the bidding of their father&mdash;a long journey. Nor had he ever so slight
a fear of his daughters, that they would form some hateful scheme, nor of his
son Apsyrtus; but this curse was being fulfilled in the children of Chalciope.
And he proclaimed terrible things in his rage against the strangers, and loudly
threatened to keep watch over the ship and its crew, so that no one might
escape calamity.
</p>
<p>
Meantime Argus, going to Aeetes’ palace, with manifold pleading besought
his mother to pray Medea’s aid; and Chalciope herself already had the
same thoughts, but fear checked her soul lest haply either fate should
withstand and she should entreat her in vain, all distraught as she would be at
her father’s deadly wrath, or, if Medea yielded to her prayers, her deeds
should be laid bare and open to view.
</p>
<p>
Now a deep slumber had relieved the maiden from her love-pains as she lay upon
her couch. But straightway fearful dreams, deceitful, such as trouble one in
grief, assailed her. And she thought that the stranger had taken on him the
contest, not because he longed to win the ram’s fleece, and that he had
not come on that account to Aeetes’ city, but to lead her away, his
wedded wife, to his own home; and she dreamed that herself contended with the
oxen and wrought the task with exceeding ease; and that her own parents set at
naught their promise, for it was not the maiden they had challenged to yoke the
oxen but the stranger himself; from that arose a contention of doubtful issue
between her father and the strangers; and both laid the decision upon her, to
be as she should direct in her mind. But she suddenly, neglecting her parents,
chose the stranger. And measureless anguish seized them and they shouted out in
their wrath; and with the cry sleep released its hold upon her. Quivering with
fear she started up, and stared round the walls of her chamber, and with
difficulty did she gather her spirit within her as before, and lifted her voice
aloud:
</p>
<p>
“Poor wretch, how have gloomy dreams affrighted me! I fear that this
voyage of the heroes will bring some great evil. My heart is trembling for the
stranger. Let him woo some Achaean girl far away among his own folk; let
maidenhood be mine and the home of my parents. Yet, taking to myself a reckless
heart, I will no more keep aloof but will make trial of my sister to see if she
will entreat me to aid in the contest, through grief for her own sons; this
would quench the bitter pain in my heart.”
</p>
<p>
She spake, and rising from her bed opened the door of her chamber, bare-footed,
clad in one robe; and verily she desired to go to her sister, and crossed the
threshold. And for long she stayed there at the entrance of her chamber, held
back by shame; and she turned back once more; and again she came forth from
within, and again stole back; and idly did her feet bear her this way and that;
yea, as oft as she went straight on, shame held her within the chamber, and
though held back by shame, bold desire kept urging her on. Thrice she made the
attempt and thrice she checked herself, the fourth time she fell on her bed
face downward, writhing in pain. And as when a bride in her chamber bewails her
youthful husband, to whom her brothers and parents have given her, nor yet does
she hold converse with all her attendants for shame and for thinking of him;
but she sits apart in her grief; and some doom has destroyed him, before they
have had pleasure of each other’s charms; and she with heart on fire
silently weeps, beholding her widowed couch, in fear lest the women should mock
and revile her; like to her did Medea lament. And suddenly as she was in the
midst of her tears, one of the handmaids came forth and noticed her, one who
was her youthful attendant; and straightway she told Chalciope, who sat in the
midst of her sons devising how to win over her sister. And when Chalciope heard
the strange tale from the handmaid, not even so did she disregard it. And she
rushed in dismay from her chamber right on to the chamber where the maiden lay
in her anguish, having torn her cheeks on each side; and when Chalciope saw her
eyes all dimmed with tears, she thus addressed her:
</p>
<p>
“Ah me, Medea, why dost thou weep so? What hath befallen thee? What
terrible grief has entered thy heart? Has some heaven-sent disease enwrapt thy
frame, or hast thou heard from our father some deadly threat concerning me and
my sons? Would that I did not behold this home of my parents, or the city, but
dwelt at the ends of the earth, where not even the name of Colchians is
known!”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake, and her sister’s cheeks flushed; and though she was eager
to reply, long did maiden shame restrain her. At one moment the word rose on
the end of her tongue, at another it fluttered back deep within her breast. And
often through her lovely lips it strove for utterance; but no sound came forth;
till at last she spoke with guileful words; for the bold Loves were pressing
her hard:
</p>
<p>
“Chalciope, my heart is all trembling for thy sons, lest my father
forthwith destroy them together with the strangers. Slumbering just now in a
short-lived sleep such a ghastly dream did I see&mdash;may some god forbid its
fulfilment and never mayst thou win for thyself bitter care on thy sons’
account.”
</p>
<p>
She spake, making trial of her sister to see if she first would entreat help
for her sons. And utterly unbearable grief surged over Chalciope’s soul
for fear at what she heard; and then she replied: “Yea, I myself too have
come to thee in eager furtherance of this purpose, if thou wouldst haply devise
with me and prepare some help. But swear by Earth and Heaven that thou wilt
keep secret in thy heart what I shall tell thee, and be fellow-worker with me.
I implore thee by the blessed gods, by thyself and by thy parents, not to see
them destroyed by an evil doom piteously; or else may I die with my dear sons
and come back hereafter from Hades an avenging Fury to haunt thee.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake, and straightway a torrent of tears gushed forth and low down
she clasped her sister’s knees with both hands and let her head sink on
to her breast. Then they both made piteous lamentation over each other, and
through the halls rose the faint sound of women weeping in anguish. Medea, sore
troubled, first addressed her sister:
</p>
<p>
“God help thee, what healing can I bring thee for what thou speakest of,
horrible curses and Furies? Would that it were firmly in my power to save thy
sons! Be witness that mighty oath of the Colchians by which thou urgest me to
swear, the great Heaven, and Earth beneath, mother of the gods, that as far as
strength lies in me, never shalt thou fail of help, if only thy prayers can be
accomplished.”
</p>
<p>
She spake, and Chalciope thus replied: “Couldst thou not then, for the
stranger&mdash;who himself craves thy aid&mdash;devise some trick or some wise
thought to win the contest, for the sake of my sons? And from him has come
Argus urging me to try to win thy help; I left him in the palace meantime while
I came hither.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake, and Medea’s heart bounded with joy within her, and at
once her fair cheeks flushed, and a mist swam before her melting eyes, and she
spake as follows: “Chalciope, as is dear and delightful to thee and thy
sons, even so will I do. Never may the dawn appear again to my eyes, never
mayst thou see me living any longer, if I should take thought for anything
before thy life or thy sons’ lives, for they are my brothers, my dear
kinsmen and youthful companions. So do I declare myself to be thy sister, and
thy daughter too, for thou didst lift me to thy breast when an infant equally
with them, as I ever heard from my mother in past days. But go, bury my
kindness in silence, so that I may carry out my promise unknown to my parents;
and at dawn I will bring to Hecate’s temple charms to cast a spell upon
the bulls.”
</p>
<p>
Thus Chalciope went back from the chamber, and made known to her sons the help
given by her sister. And again did shame and hateful fear seize Medea thus left
alone, that she should devise such deeds for a man in her father’s
despite.
</p>
<p>
Then did night draw darkness over the earth; and on the sea sailors from their
ships looked towards the Bear and the stars of Orion; and now the wayfarer and
the warder longed for sleep, and the pall of slumber wrapped round the mother
whose children were dead; nor was there any more the barking of dogs through
the city, nor sound of men’s voices; but silence held the blackening
gloom. But not indeed upon Medea came sweet sleep. For in her love for
Aeson’s son many cares kept her wakeful, and she dreaded the mighty
strength of the bulls, beneath whose fury he was like to perish by an unseemly
fate in the field of Ares. And fast did her heart throb within her breast, as a
sunbeam quivers upon the walls of a house when flung up from water, which is
just poured forth in a caldron or a pail may be; and hither and thither on the
swift eddy does it dart and dance along; even so the maiden’s heart
quivered in her breast. And the tear of pity flowed from her eyes, and ever
within anguish tortured her, a smouldering fire through her frame, and about
her fine nerves and deep down beneath the nape of the neck where the pain
enters keenest, whenever the unwearied Loves direct against the heart their
shafts of agony. And she thought now that she would give him the charms to cast
a spell on the bulls, now that she would not, and that she herself would
perish; and again that she would not perish and would not give the charms, but
just as she was would endure her fate in silence. Then sitting down she wavered
in mind and said:
</p>
<p>
“Poor wretch, must I toss hither and thither in woe? On every side my
heart is in despair; nor is there any help for my pain; but it burneth ever
thus. Would that I had been slain by the swift shafts of Artemis before I had
set eyes on him, before Chalciope’s sons reached the Achaean land. Some
god or some Fury brought them hither for our grief, a cause of many tears. Let
him perish in the contest if it be his lot to die in the field. For how could I
prepare the charms without my parents’ knowledge? What story call I tell
them? What trick, what cunning device for aid can I find? If I see him alone,
apart from his comrades, shall I greet him? Ill-starred that I am! I cannot
hope that I should rest from my sorrows even though he perished; then will evil
come to me when he is bereft of life. Perish all shame, perish all glow; may
he, saved by my effort, go scatheless wherever his heart desires. But as for
me, on the day when he bides the contest in triumph, may I die either straining
my neck in the noose from the roof-tree or tasting drugs destructive of life.
But even so, when I am dead, they will fling out taunts against me; and every
city far away will ring with my doom, and the Colchian women, tossing my name
on their lips hither and thither, will revile me with unseemly
mocking&mdash;the maid who cared so much for a stranger that she died, the maid
who disgraced her home and her parents, yielding to a mad passion. And what
disgrace will not be mine? Alas for my infatuation! Far better would it be for
me to forsake life this very night in my chamber by some mysterious fate,
escaping all slanderous reproach, before I complete such nameless
dishonour.”
</p>
<p>
She spake, and brought a casket wherein lay many drugs, some for healing,
others for killing, and placing it upon her knees she wept. And she drenched
her bosom with ceaseless tears, which flowed in torrents as she sat, bitterly
bewailing her own fate. And she longed to choose a murderous drug to taste it,
and now she was loosening the bands of the casket eager to take it forth,
unhappy maid! But suddenly a deadly fear of hateful Hades came upon her heart.
And long she held back in speechless horror, and all around her thronged
visions of the pleasing cares of life. She thought of all the delightful things
that are among the living, she thought of her joyous playmates, as a maiden
will; and the sun grew sweeter than ever to behold, seeing that in truth her
soul yearned for all. And she put the casket again from off her knees, all
changed by the prompting of Hera, and no more did she waver in purpose; but
longed for the rising dawn to appear quickly, that she might give him the
charms to work the spell as she had promised, and meet him face to face. And
often did she loosen the bolts of her door, to watch for the faint gleam: and
welcome to her did the dayspring shed its light, and folk began to stir
throughout the city.
</p>
<p>
Then Argus bade his brothers remain there to learn the maiden’s mind and
plans, but himself turned back and went to the ship.
</p>
<p>
Now soon as ever the maiden saw the light of dawn, with her hands she gathered
up her golden tresses which were floating round her shoulders in careless
disarray, and bathed her tear-stained cheeks, and made her skin shine with
ointment sweet as nectar; and she donned a beautiful robe, fitted with
well-bent clasps, and above on her head, divinely fair, she threw a veil
gleaming like silver. And there, moving to and fro in the palace, she trod the
ground forgetful of the heaven-sent woes thronging round her and of others that
were destined to follow. And she called to her maids. Twelve they were, who lay
during the night in the vestibule of her fragrant chamber, young as herself,
not yet sharing the bridal couch, and she bade them hastily yoke the mules to
the chariot to bear her to the beauteous shrine of Hecate. Thereupon the
handmaids were making ready the chariot; and Medea meanwhile took from the
hollow casket a charm which men say is called the charm of Prometheus. If a man
should anoint his body therewithal, having first appeased the Maiden, the
only-begotten, with sacrifice by night, surely that man could not be wounded by
the stroke of bronze nor would he flinch from blazing fire; but for that day he
would prove superior both in prowess and in might. It shot up first-born when
the ravening eagle on the rugged flanks of Caucasus let drip to the earth the
blood-like ichor of tortured Prometheus. And its
flower appeared a cubit above ground in colour like the Corycian crocus, rising
on twin stalks; but in the earth the root was like newly-cut flesh. The dark
juice of it, like the sap of a mountain-oak, she had gathered in a Caspian
shell to make the charm withal, when she had first bathed in seven ever-flowing
streams, and had called seven times on Brimo, nurse of youth, night-wandering
Brimo, of the underworld, queen among the dead,&mdash;in the gloom of night,
clad in dusky garments. And beneath, the dark earth shook and bellowed when the
Titanian root was cut; and the son of Iapetus himself groaned, his soul
distraught with pain. And she brought the charm forth and placed it in the
fragrant band which engirdled her, just beneath her bosom, divinely fair. And
going forth she mounted the swift chariot, and with her went two handmaidens on
each side. And she herself took the reins and in her right hand the
well-fashioned whip, and drove through the city; and the rest, the handmaids,
laid their hands on the chariot behind and ran along the broad highway; and
they kilted up their light robes above their white knees. And even as by the
mild waters of Parthenius, or after bathing in the river Amnisus, Leto’s
daughter stands upon her golden chariot and courses over the hills with her
swift-footed roes, to greet from afar some richly-steaming hecatomb; and with
her come the nymphs in attendance, gathering, some at the spring of Amnisus
itself, others by the glens and many-fountained peaks; and round her whine and
fawn the beasts cowering as she moves along: thus they sped through the city;
and on both sides the people gave way, shunning the eyes of the royal maiden.
But when she had left the city’s well paved streets, and was approaching
the shrine as she drove over the plains, then she alighted eagerly from the
smooth-running chariot and spake as follows among her maidens:
</p>
<p>
“Friends, verily have I sinned greatly and took no heed not to go among
the stranger-folk who roam over our land. The whole
city is smitten with dismay; wherefore no one of the women who formerly
gathered here day by day has now come hither. But since we have come and no one
else draws near, come, let us satisfy our souls without stint with soothing
song, and when we have plucked the fair flowers amid the tender grass, that
very hour will we return. And with many a gift shall ye reach home this very
day, if ye will gladden me with this desire of mine. For Argus pleads with me,
also Chalciope herself; but this that ye hear from me keep silently in your
hearts, lest the tale reach my father’s ears. As for yon stranger who
took on him the task with the oxen, they bid me receive his gifts and rescue
him from the deadly contest. And I approved their counsel, and I have summoned
him to come to my presence apart from his comrades, so that we may divide the
gifts among ourselves if he bring them in his hands, and in return may give him
a baleful charm. But when he comes, do ye stand aloof.”
</p>
<p>
So she spake, and the crafty counsel pleased them all. And straightway Argus
drew Aeson’s son apart from his comrades as soon as he heard from his
brothers that Medea had gone at daybreak to the holy shrine of Hecate, and led
him over the plain; and with them went Mopsus, son of Ampycus, skilled to utter
oracles from the appearance of birds, and skilled to give good counsel to those
who set out on a journey.
</p>
<p>
Never yet had there been such a man in the days of old, neither of all the
heroes of the lineage of Zeus himself, nor of those who sprung from the blood
of the other gods, as on that day the bride of Zeus made Jason, both to look
upon and to hold converse with. Even his comrades wondered as they gazed upon
him, radiant with manifold graces; and the son of Ampycus rejoiced in their
journey, already foreboding how all would end.
</p>
<p>
Now by the path along the plain there stands near the shrine a poplar with its
crown of countless leaves, whereon often chattering crows would roost. One of
them meantime as she clapped her wings aloft in the branches uttered the
counsels of Hera:
</p>
<p>
“What a pitiful seer is this, that has not the wit to conceive even what
children know, how that no maiden will say a word of sweetness or love to a
youth when strangers be near. Begone, sorry prophet, witless one; on thee
neither Cypris nor the gentle Loves breathe in their kindness.”
</p>
<p>
She spake chiding, and Mopsus smiled to hear the god-sent voice of the bird,
and thus addressed them: “Do thou, son of Aeson, pass on to the temple,
where thou wilt find the maiden; and very kind will her greeting be to thee
through the prompting of Cypris, who will be thy helpmate in the contest, even
as Phineus, Agenor’s son, foretold. But we two, Argus and I, will await
thy return, apart in this very spot; do thou all alone be a suppliant and win
her over with prudent words.”
</p>
<p>
He spake wisely, and both at once gave approval. Nor was Medea’s heart
turned to other thoughts, for all her singing, and never a song that she
essayed pleased her long in her sport. But in confusion she ever faltered, nor
did she keep her eyes resting quietly upon the throng of her handmaids; but to
the paths far off she strained her gaze, turning her face aside. Oft did her
heart sink fainting within her bosom whenever she fancied she heard passing by
the sound of a footfall or of the wind. But soon he appeared to her longing
eyes, striding along loftily, like Sirius coming from ocean, which rises fair
and clear to see, but brings unspeakable mischief to flocks; thus then did
Aeson’s son come to her, fair to see, but the sight of him brought
love-sick care. Her heart fell from out her bosom, and a dark mist came over
her eyes, and a hot blush covered her cheeks. And she had no strength to lift
her knees backwards or forwards, but her feet beneath were rooted to the
ground; and meantime all her handmaidens had drawn aside. So they two stood
face to face without a word, without a sound, like oaks or lofty pines, which
stand quietly side by side on the mountains when the wind is still; then again,
when stirred by the breath of the wind, they murmur ceaselessly; so they two
were destined to tell out all their tale, stirred by the breath of Love. And
Aeson’s son saw that she had fallen into some heaven-sent calamity, and
with soothing words thus addressed her:
</p>
<p>
“Why, pray, maiden, dost thou fear me so much, all alone as I am? Never
was I one of these idle boasters such as other men are&mdash;not even
aforetime, when I dwelt in my own country. Wherefore, maiden, be not too much
abashed before me, either to enquire whatever thou wilt or to speak thy mind.
But since we have met one another with friendly hearts, in a hallowed spot,
where it is wrong to sin, speak openly and ask questions, and beguile me not
with pleasing words, for at the first thou didst promise thy sister to give me
the charms my heart desires. I implore thee by Hecate herself, by thy parents,
and by Zeus who holds his guardian hand over strangers and suppliants; I come
here to thee both a suppliant and a stranger, bending the knee in my sore need.
For without thee and thy sister never shall I prevail in the grievous contest.
And to thee will I render thanks hereafter for thy aid, as is right and fitting
for men who dwell far off, making glorious thy name and fame; and the rest of
the heroes, returning to Hellas, will spread thy renown and so will the
heroes’ wives and mothers, who now perhaps are sitting on the shore and
making moan for us; their painful affliction thou mightest scatter to the
winds. In days past the maiden Ariadne, daughter of Minos, with kindly intent
rescued Theseus from grim contests&mdash;the maiden whom Pasiphae daughter of
Helios bare. But she, when Minos had lulled his wrath to rest, went aboard the
ship with him and left her fatherland; and her even the immortal gods loved,
and, as a sign in mid-sky, a crown of stars, which men call Ariadne’s
crown, rolls along all night among the heavenly constellations. So to thee too
shall be thanks from the gods, if thou wilt save so mighty an array of
chieftains. For surely from thy lovely form thou art like to excel in gentle
courtesy.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, honouring her; and she cast her eyes down with a smile divinely
sweet; and her soul melted within her, uplifted by his praise, and she gazed
upon him face to face; nor did she know what word to utter first, but was eager
to pour out everything at once. And forth from her fragrant girdle ungrudgingly
she brought out the charm; and he at once received it in his hands with joy.
And she would even have drawn out all her soul from her breast and given it to
him, exulting in his desire; so wonderfully did love flash forth a sweet flame
from the golden head of Aeson’s son; and he captivated her gleaming eyes;
and her heart within grew warm, melting away as the dew melts away round roses
when warmed by the morning’s light. And now both were fixing their eyes
on the ground abashed, and again were throwing glances at each other, smiling
with the light of love beneath their radiant brows. And at last and scarcely
then did the maiden greet him:
</p>
<p>
“Take heed now, that I may devise help for thee. When at thy coming my
father has given thee the deadly teeth from the dragon’s jaws for sowing,
then watch for the time when the night is parted in twain, then bathe in the
stream of the tireless river, and alone, apart from others, clad in dusky
raiment, dig a rounded pit; and therein slay a ewe, and sacrifice it whole,
heaping high the pyre on the very edge of the pit. And propitiate only-begotten
Hecate, daughter of Perses, pouring from a goblet the hive-stored labour of
bees. And then, when thou hast heedfully sought the grace of the goddess,
retreat from the pyre; and let neither the sound of feet drive thee to turn
back, nor the baying of hounds, lest haply thou shouldst maim all the rites and
thyself fail to return duly to thy comrades. And at dawn steep this charm in
water, strip, and anoint thy body therewith as with oil; and in it there will
be boundless prowess and mighty strength, and thou wilt deem thyself a match
not for men but for the immortal gods. And besides, let thy spear and shield
and sword be sprinkled. Thereupon the spear-heads of the earthborn men shall
not pierce thee, nor the flame of the deadly bulls as it rushes forth
resistless. But such thou shalt be not for long, but for that one day; still
never flinch from the contest. And I will tell thee besides of yet another
help. As soon as thou hast yoked the strong oxen, and with thy might and thy
prowess hast ploughed all the stubborn fallow, and now along the furrows the
Giants are springing up, when the serpent’s teeth are sown on the dusky
clods, if thou markest them uprising in throngs from the fallow, cast unseen
among them a massy stone; and they over it, like ravening hounds over their
food, will slay one another; and do thou thyself hasten to rush to the
battle-strife, and the fleece thereupon thou shalt bear far away from Aea;
nevertheless, depart wherever thou wilt, or thy pleasure takes thee, when thou
hast gone hence.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake, and cast her eyes to her feet in silence, and her cheek,
divinely fair, was wet with warm tears as she sorrowed for that he was about to
wander far from her side over the wide sea: and once again she addressed him
face to face with mournful words, and took his right hand; for now shame had
left her eyes:
</p>
<p>
“Remember, if haply thou returnest to thy home, Medea’s name; and
so will I remember thine, though thou be far away. And of thy kindness tell me
this, where is thy home, whither wilt thou sail hence in thy ship over the sea;
wilt thou come near wealthy Orchomenus, or near the Aeaean isle? And tell me of
the maiden, whosoever she be that thou hast named, the far-renowned daughter of
Pasiphae, who is kinswoman to my father.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake; and over him too, at the tears of the maiden, stole Love the
destroyer, and he thus answered her:
</p>
<p>
“All too surely do I deem that never by night and never by day will I
forget thee if I escape death and indeed make my way in safety to the Achaean
land, and Aeetes set not before us some other contest worse than this. And if
it pleases thee to know about my fatherland, I will tell it out; for indeed my
own heart bids me do that. There is a land encircled by lofty mountains, rich
in sheep and in pasture, where Prometheus, son of Iapetus, begat goodly
Deucalion, who first founded cities and reared temples to the immortal gods,
and first ruled over men. This land the neighbours who dwell around call
Haemonia. And in it stands Ioleus, my city, and in it many others, where they
have not so much as heard the name of the Aeaean isle; yet there is a story
that Minyas starting thence, Minyas son of Aeolus, built long ago the city of
Orchomenus that borders on the Cadmeians. But why do I tell thee all this vain
talk, of our home and of Minos’ daughter, far-famed Ariadne, by which
glorious name they called that lovely maiden of whom thou askest me? Would
that, as Minos then was well inclined to Theseus for her sake, so may thy
father be joined to us in friendship!”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake, soothing her with gentle converse. But pangs most bitter stirred
her heart and in grief did she address him with vehement words:
</p>
<p>
“In Hellas, I ween, this is fair to pay heed to covenants; but Aeetes is
not such a man among men as thou sayest was Pasiphae’s husband, Minos;
nor can I liken myself to Ariadne; wherefore speak not of guest-love. But only
do thou, when thou hast reached Iolcus, remember me, and thee even in my
parents’ despite, will I remember. And from far off may a rumour come to
me or some messenger-bird, when thou forgettest me; or me, even me, may swift
blasts catch up and bear over the sea hence to Iolcus, that so I may cast
reproaches in thy face and remind thee that it was by my good will thou didst
escape. May I then be seated in thy halls, an unexpected guest!”
</p>
<p>
Thus she spake with piteous tears falling down her cheeks, and to her Jason
replied: “Let the empty blasts wander at will, lady, and the
messenger-bird, for vain is thy talk. But if thou comest to those abodes and to
the land of Hellas, honoured and reverenced shalt thou be by women and men; and
they shall worship thee even as a goddess, for that by thy counsel their sons
came home again, their brothers and kinsmen and stalwart husbands were saved
from calamity. And in our bridal chamber shalt thou prepare our couch; and
nothing shall come between our love till the doom of death fold us
round.”
</p>
<p>
Thus he spake; and her soul melted within her to hear his words; nevertheless
she shuddered to behold the deeds of destruction to come. Poor wretch! Not long
was she destined to refuse a home in Hellas. For thus Hera devised it, that
Aeaean Medea might come to Ioleus for a bane to Pelias, forsaking her native
land.
</p>
<p>
And now her handmaids, glancing at them from a distance, were grieving in
silence; and the time of day required that the maiden should return home to her
mother’s side. But she thought not yet of departing, for her soul
delighted both in his beauty and in his winsome words, but Aeson’s son
took heed, and spake at last, though late: “It is time to depart, lest
the sunlight sink before we know it, and some stranger notice all; but again
will we come and meet here.”
</p>
<p>
So did they two make trial of one another thus far with gentle words; and
thereafter parted. Jason hastened to return in joyous mood to his comrades and
the ship, she to her handmaids; and they all together came near to meet her,
but she marked them not at all as they thronged around. For her soul had soared
aloft amid the clouds. And her feet of their own accord mounted the swift
chariot, and with one hand she took the reins, and with the other the whip of
cunning workmanship, to drive the mules; and they rushed hasting to the city
and the palace. And when she was come Chalciope in grief for her sons
questioned her; but Medea, distraught by swiftly-changing thoughts, neither
heard her words nor was eager to speak in answer to her questions. But she sat
upon a low stool at the foot of her couch, bending down, her cheek leaning on
her left hand, and her eyes were wet with tears as she pondered what an evil
deed she had taken part in by her counsels.
</p>
<p>
Now when Aeson’s son had joined his comrades again in the spot where he
had left them when he departed, he set out to go with them, telling them all
the story, to the gathering of the heroes; and together they approached the
ship. And when they saw Jason they embraced him and questioned him. And he told
to all the counsels of the maiden and showed the dread charm; but Idas alone of
his comrades sat apart biting down his wrath; and the rest joyous in heart, at
the hour when the darkness of night stayed them, peacefully took thought for
themselves. But at daybreak they sent two men to go to Aeetes and ask for the
seed, first Telamon himself, dear to Ares, and with him Aethalides,
Hermes’ famous son. So they went and made no vain journey; but when they
came, lordly Aeetes gave them for the contest the fell teeth of the Aonian
dragon which Cadmus found in Ogygian Thebes when he came seeking for Europa and
there slew the warder of the spring of Ares. There he settled by the
guidance of the heifer whom Apollo by his prophetic word granted him to lead
him on his way. But the teeth the Tritonian goddess tore away from the
dragon’s jaws and bestowed as a gift upon Aeetes and the slayer. And
Agenor’s son, Cadmus, sowed them on the Aonian plains and founded an
earthborn people of all who were left from the spear when Ares did the reaping;
and the teeth Aeetes then readily gave to be borne to the ship, for he deemed
not that Jason would bring the contest to an end, even though he should cast
the yoke upon the oxen.
</p>
<p>
Far away in the west the sun was sailing beneath the dark earth, beyond the
furthest hills of the Aethiopians; and Night was laying the yoke upon her
steeds; and the heroes were preparing their beds by the hawsers. But Jason, as
soon as the stars of Heliee, the bright-gleaming bear, had set, and the air had
all grown still under heaven, went to a desert spot, like some stealthy thief,
with all that was needful; for beforehand in the daytime had he taken thought
for everything; and Argus came bringing a ewe and milk from the flock; and them
he took from the ship. But when the hero saw a place which was far away from
the tread of men, in a clear meadow beneath the open sky, there first of all he
bathed his tender body reverently in the sacred river; and round him he placed
a dark robe, which Hypsipyle of Lemnos had given him aforetime, a memorial of
many a loving embrace. Then he dug a pit in the ground of a cubit’s depth
and heaped up billets of wood, and over it he cut the throat of the sheep, and
duly placed the carcase above; and he kindled the logs placing fire beneath,
and poured over them mingled libations, calling on Hecate Brimo to aid him in
the contests. And when he had called on her he drew back; and she heard him,
the dread goddess, from the uttermost depths and came to the sacrifice of
Aeson’s son; and round her horrible serpents twined themselves among the
oak boughs; and there was a gleam of countless torches; and sharply howled
around her the hounds of hell. All the meadows trembled at her step; and the
nymphs that haunt the marsh and the river shrieked, all who dance round that
mead of Amarantian Phasis. And fear seized Aeson’s son, but not even so
did he turn round as his feet bore him forth, till he came back to his
comrades; and now early dawn arose and shed her light above snowy Caucasus.
</p>
<p>
Then Aeetes arrayed his breast in the stiff corslet which Ares gave him when he
had slain Phlegraean Mimas with his own hands; and upon his head he placed a
golden helmet with four plumes, gleaming like the sun’s round light when
he first rises from Ocean. And he wielded his shield of many hides, and his
spear, terrible, resistless; none of the heroes could have withstood its shock
now that they had left behind Heracles far away, who alone could have met it in
battle. For the king his well-fashioned chariot of swift steeds was held near
at hand by Phaethon, for him to mount; and he mounted, and held the reins in
his hands. Then from the city he drove along the broad highway, that he might
be present at the contest; and with him a countless multitude rushed forth. And
as Poseidon rides, mounted in his chariot, to the Isthmian contest or to
Taenarus, or to Lerna’s water, or through the grove of Hyantian
Onchestus, and thereafter passes even to Calaureia with his steeds, and the
Haemonian rock, or well-wooded Geraestus; even so was Aeetes, lord of the
Colchians, to behold.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, prompted by Medea, Jason steeped the charm in water and sprinkled
with it his shield and sturdy spear, and sword; and his comrades round him made
proof of his weapons with might and main, but could not bend that spear even a
little, but it remained firm in their stalwart hands unbroken as before. But in
furious rage with them Idas, Aphareus’ son, with his great sword hewed at
the spear near the butt, and the edge leapt back repelled by the shock, like a
hammer from the anvil; and the heroes shouted with joy for their hope in the
contest. And then he sprinkled his body, and terrible prowess entered into him,
unspeakable, dauntless; and his hands on both sides thrilled vigorously as they
swelled with strength. And as when a warlike steed eager for the fight neighs
and beats the ground with his hoof, while rejoicing he lifts his neck on high
with ears erect; in such wise did Aeson’s son rejoice in the strength of
his limbs. And often hither and thither did he leap high in air tossing in his
hands his shield of bronze and ashen spear. Thou wouldst say that wintry
lightning flashing from the gloomy sky kept on darting forth from the clouds
what time they bring with them their blackest rainstorm. Not long after that
were the heroes to hold back from the contests; but sitting in rows on their
benches they sped swiftly on to the plain of Ares. And it lay in front of them
on the opposite side of the city, as far off as is the turning-post that a
chariot must reach from the starting-point, when the kinsmen of a dead king
appoint funeral games for footmen and horsemen. And they found Aeetes and the
tribes of the Colchians; these were stationed on the Caucasian heights, but the
king by the winding brink of the river.
</p>
<p>
Now Aeson’s son, as soon as his comrades had made the hawsers fast, leapt
from the ship, and with spear and shield came forth to the contest; and at the
same time he took the gleaming helmet of bronze filled with sharp teeth, and
his sword girt round his shoulders, his body stripped, in somewise resembling
Ares and in somewise Apollo of the golden sword. And gazing over the field he
saw the bulls’ yoke of bronze and near it the plough, all of one piece,
of stubborn adamant. Then he came near, and fixed his sturdy spear upright on
its butt, and taking his helmet, off leant it against the spear. And he went
forward with shield alone to examine the countless tracks of the bulls, and
they from some unseen lair beneath the earth, where was their strong steading,
wrapt in murky smoke, both rushed out together, breathing forth flaming fire.
And sore afraid were the heroes at the sight. But Jason, setting wide his feet,
withstood their onset, as in the sea a rocky reef withstands the waves tossed
by the countless blasts. Then in front of him he held his shield; and both the
bulls with loud bellowing attacked him with their mighty horns; nor did they
stir him a jot by their onset. And as when through the holes of the furnace the
armourers’ bellows anon gleam brightly, kindling the ravening flame, and
anon cease from blowing, and a terrible roar rises from the fire when it darts
up from below; so the bulls roared, breathing forth swift flame from their
mouths, while the consuming heat played round him, smiting like lightning; but
the maiden’s charms protected him. Then grasping the tip of the horn of
the right-hand bull, he dragged it mightily with all his strength to bring it
near the yoke of bronze, and forced it down on to its knees, suddenly striking
with his foot the foot of bronze. So also he threw the other bull on to its
knees as it rushed upon him, and smote it down with one blow. And throwing to
the ground his broad shield, he held them both down where they had fallen on
their fore-knees, as he strode from side to side, now here, now there, and
rushed swiftly through the flame. But Aeetes marvelled at the hero’s
might. And meantime the sons of Tyndareus for long since had it been thus
ordained for them&mdash;near at hand gave him the yoke from the ground to cast
round them. Then tightly did he bind their necks; and lifting the pole of
bronze between them, he fastened it to the yoke by its golden tip. So the twin
heroes started back from the fire to the ship. But Jason took up again his
shield and cast it on his back behind him, and grasped the strong helmet filled
with sharp teeth, and his resistless spear, wherewith, like some ploughman with
a Pelasgian goad, he pricked the bulls beneath, striking their flanks; and very
firmly did he guide the well fitted plough handle, fashioned of adamant.
</p>
<p>
The bulls meantime raged exceedingly, breathing forth furious flame of fire;
and their breath rose up like the roar of blustering winds, in fear of which
above all seafaring men furl their large sail. But not long after that they
moved on at the bidding of the spear; and behind them the rugged fallow was
broken up, cloven by the might of the bulls and the sturdy ploughman. Then
terribly groaned the clods withal along the furrows of the plough as they were
rent, each a man’s burden; and Jason followed, pressing down the
cornfield with firm foot; and far from him he ever sowed the teeth along the
clods as each was ploughed, turning his head back for fear lest the deadly crop
of earthborn men should rise against him first; and the bulls toiled onwards
treading with their hoofs of bronze.
</p>
<p>
But when the third part of the day was still left as it wanes from dawn, and
wearied labourers call for the sweet hour of unyoking to come to them
straightway, then the fallow was ploughed by the tireless ploughman, four
plough-gates though it was; and he loosed the plough from the oxen. Them he
scared in flight towards the plain; but he went back again to the ship, while
he still saw the furrows free of the earthborn men. And all round his comrades
heartened him with their shouts. And in the helmet he drew from the
river’s stream and quenched his thirst with the water. Then he bent his
knees till they grew supple, and filled his mighty heart with courage, raging
like a boar, when it sharpens its teeth against the hunters, while from its
wrathful mouth plenteous foam drips to the ground. By now the earthborn men
were springing up over all the field; and the plot of Ares, the death-dealer,
bristled with sturdy shields and double-pointed spears and shining helmets; and
the gleam reached Olympus from beneath, flashing through the air. And as when
abundant snow has fallen on the earth and the storm blasts have dispersed the
wintry clouds under the murky night, and all the hosts of the stars appear
shining through the gloom; so did those warriors shine springing up above the
earth. But Jason bethought him of the counsels of Medea full of craft, and
seized from the plain a huge round boulder, a terrible quoit of Ares Enyalius;
four stalwart youths could not have raised it from the ground even a little.
Taking it in his hands he threw it with a rush far away into their midst; and
himself crouched unseen behind his shield, with full confidence. And the
Colchians gave a loud cry, like the roar of the sea when it beats upon sharp
crags; and speechless amazement seized Aeetes at the rush of the sturdy quoit.
And the Earthborn, like fleet-footed hounds, leaped upon one another and slew
with loud yells; and on earth their mother they fell beneath their own spears,
likes pines or oaks, which storms of wind beat down. And even as a fiery star
leaps from heaven, trailing a furrow of light, a portent to men, whoever see it
darting with a gleam through the dusky sky; in such wise did Aeson’s son
rush upon the earthborn men, and he drew from the sheath his bare sword, and
smote here and there, mowing them down, many on the belly and side, half risen
to the air&mdash;and some that had risen as far as the shoulders&mdash;and some
just standing upright, and others even now rushing to battle. And as when a
fight is stirred up concerning boundaries, and a husbandman, in fear lest they
should ravage his fields, seizes in his hand a curved sickle, newly sharpened,
and hastily cuts the unripe crop, and waits not for it to be parched in due
season by the beams of the sun; so at that time did Jason cut down the crop of
the Earthborn; and the furrows were filled with blood, as the channels of a
spring with water. And they fell, some on their faces biting the rough clod of
earth with their teeth, some on their backs, and others on their hands and
sides, like to sea-monsters to behold. And many, smitten before raising their
feet from the earth, bowed down as far to the ground as they had risen to the
air, and rested there with the damp of death on their brows. Even so, I ween,
when Zeus has sent a measureless rain, new planted orchard-shoots droop to the
ground, cut off by the root the toil of gardening men; but heaviness of heart
and deadly anguish come to the owner of the farm, who planted them; so at that
time did bitter grief come upon the heart of King Aeetes. And he went back to
the city among the Colchians, pondering how he might most quickly oppose the
heroes. And the day died, and Jason’s contest was ended.

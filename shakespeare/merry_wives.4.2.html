<blockquote>
<em>Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS FORD</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my</span><br/>
<span id='2'>sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>and I profess requital to a hair's breadth; not</span><br/>
<span id='4'>only, Mistress Ford, in the simple</span><br/>
<span id='5'>office of love, but in all the accoutrement,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>complement and ceremony of it. But are you</span><br/>
<span id='7'>sure of your husband now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>He's a-birding, sweet Sir John.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>[Within]  What, ho, gossip Ford! what, ho!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Step into the chamber, Sir John.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit FALSTAFF</em></p>
<p><em>Enter MISTRESS PAGE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>How now, sweetheart! who's at home besides yourself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Why, none but mine own people.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Indeed!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>No, certainly.</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside to her</em></p>
<span id='15'>Speak louder.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Why?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>he so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails</span><br/>
<span id='20'>against all married mankind; so curses all Eve's</span><br/>
<span id='21'>daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets</span><br/>
<span id='22'>himself on the forehead, crying, 'Peer out, peer</span><br/>
<span id='23'>out!' that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but</span><br/>
<span id='24'>tameness, civility and patience, to this his</span><br/>
<span id='25'>distemper he is in now: I am glad the fat knight is not here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Why, does he talk of him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Of none but him; and swears he was carried out, the</span><br/>
<span id='28'>last time he searched for him, in a basket; protests</span><br/>
<span id='29'>to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and</span><br/>
<span id='30'>the rest of their company from their sport, to make</span><br/>
<span id='31'>another experiment of his suspicion: but I am glad</span><br/>
<span id='32'>the knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>How near is he, Mistress Page?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Hard by; at street end; he will be here anon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>I am undone! The knight is here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Why then you are utterly shamed, and he's but a dead</span><br/>
<span id='37'>man. What a woman are you!&mdash;Away with him, away</span><br/>
<span id='38'>with him! better shame than murder.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Which way should be go? how should I bestow him?</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Shall I put him into the basket again?</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter FALSTAFF</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>No, I'll come no more i' the basket. May I not go</span><br/>
<span id='42'>out ere he come?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Alas, three of Master Ford's brothers watch the door</span><br/>
<span id='44'>with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise</span><br/>
<span id='45'>you might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>There they always use to discharge their</span><br/>
<span id='48'>birding-pieces. Creep into the kiln-hole.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Where is it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an</span><br/>
<span id='52'>abstract for the remembrance of such places, and</span><br/>
<span id='53'>goes to them by his note: there is no hiding you in the house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>I'll go out then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>If you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir</span><br/>
<span id='56'>John. Unless you go out disguised&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>How might we disguise him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Alas the day, I know not! There is no woman's gown</span><br/>
<span id='59'>big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>a muffler and a kerchief, and so escape.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather</span><br/>
<span id='62'>than a mischief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>My maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a</span><br/>
<span id='64'>gown above.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>On my word, it will serve him; she's as big as he</span><br/>
<span id='66'>is: and there's her thrummed hat and her muffler</span><br/>
<span id='67'>too. Run up, Sir John.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Go, go, sweet Sir John: Mistress Page and I will</span><br/>
<span id='69'>look some linen for your head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Quick, quick! we'll come dress you straight: put</span><br/>
<span id='71'>on the gown the while.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit FALSTAFF</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>I would my husband would meet him in this shape: he</span><br/>
<span id='73'>cannot abide the old woman of Brentford; he swears</span><br/>
<span id='74'>she's a witch; forbade her my house and hath</span><br/>
<span id='75'>threatened to beat her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel, and the</span><br/>
<span id='77'>devil guide his cudgel afterwards!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>But is my husband coming?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Ah, in good sadness, is he; and talks of the basket</span><br/>
<span id='80'>too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry the</span><br/>
<span id='82'>basket again, to meet him at the door with it, as</span><br/>
<span id='83'>they did last time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Nay, but he'll be here presently: let's go dress him</span><br/>
<span id='85'>like the witch of Brentford.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>I'll first direct my men what they shall do with the</span><br/>
<span id='87'>basket. Go up; I'll bring linen for him straight.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse him enough.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>We'll leave a proof, by that which we will do,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Wives may be merry, and yet honest too:</span><br/>
<span id='91'>We do not act that often jest and laugh;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>'Tis old, but true, Still swine eat all the draff.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter MISTRESS FORD with two Servants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>your master is hard at door; if he bid you set it</span><br/>
<span id='95'>down, obey him: quickly, dispatch.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>First Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Come, come, take it up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Second Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>First Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>I hope not; I had as lief bear so much lead.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any</span><br/>
<span id='100'>way then to unfool me again? Set down the basket,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!</span><br/>
<span id='102'>O you panderly rascals! there's a knot, a ging, a</span><br/>
<span id='103'>pack, a conspiracy against me: now shall the devil</span><br/>
<span id='104'>be shamed. What, wife, I say! Come, come forth!</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to go</span><br/>
<span id='107'>loose any longer; you must be pinioned.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>SIR HUGH EVANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Why, this is lunatics! this is mad as a mad dog!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.</span><br/>

<span id='114'>without cause, mistress, do I?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>FORD</strong></span>

<span id='125'>Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed</span><br/>
<span id='126'>out of my house yesterday in this basket: why may</span><br/>

<span id='speech63'><strong>SIR HUGH EVANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the</span><br/>

<span id='136'>Well, he's not here I seek for.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Help to search my house this one time. If I find</span><br/>
<span id='139'>not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let</span><br/>
<span id='140'>me for ever be your table-sport; let them say of</span><br/>
<span id='141'>me, 'As jealous as Ford, Chat searched a hollow</span><br/>
<span id='142'>walnut for his wife's leman.' Satisfy me once more;</span><br/>

<span id='150'>she? We are simple men; we do not know what's</span><br/>
<span id='151'>brought to pass under the profession of</span><br/>
<span id='152'>fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>by the figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond</span><br/>
<span id='154'>our element we know nothing. Come down, you witch,</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Nay, good, sweet husband! Good gentlemen, let him</span><br/>

<span id='speech84'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Will the king come, that I may breathe my last</span><br/>
<span id='2'>In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>O, but they say the tongues of dying men</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Enforce attention like deep harmony:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>He that no more must say is listen'd more</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The setting sun, and music at the close,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Writ in remembrance more than things long past:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound</span><br/>
<span id='20'>The open ear of youth doth always listen;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Report of fashions in proud Italy,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Whose manners still our tardy apish nation</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Limps after in base imitation.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>So it be new, there's no respect how vile&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Direct not him whose way himself will choose:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Methinks I am a prophet new inspired</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And thus expiring do foretell of him:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>For violent fires soon burn out themselves;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>This other Eden, demi-paradise,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>This fortress built by Nature for herself</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Against infection and the hand of war,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>This happy breed of men, this little world,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>This precious stone set in the silver sea,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Which serves it in the office of a wall,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Or as a moat defensive to a house,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Against the envy of less happier lands,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Renowned for their deeds as far from home,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>For Christian service and true chivalry,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Dear for her reputation through the world,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Like to a tenement or pelting farm:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>England, bound in with the triumphant sea</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>That England, that was wont to conquer others,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>How happy then were my ensuing death!</span><br/>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.</span><br/>

<span id='speech7'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>O how that name befits my composition!</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?</span><br/>
<span id='77'>For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Can sick men play so nicely with their names?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>No, misery makes sport to mock itself:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Should dying men flatter with those that live?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>No, no, men living flatter those that die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And thou, too careless patient as thou art,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Of those physicians that first wounded thee:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>And yet, incaged in so small a verge,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>It were a shame to let this land by lease;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>But for thy world enjoying but this land,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Is it not more than shame to shame it so?</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Landlord of England art thou now, not king:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou&mdash;</span><br/>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>         A lunatic lean-witted fool,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Presuming on an ague's privilege,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Darest with thy frozen admonition</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood</span><br/>
<span id='119'>With fury from his native residence.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>For that I was his father Edward's son;</span><br/>
<span id='126'>That blood already, like the pelican,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:</span><br/>
<span id='128'>My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!</span><br/>
<span id='130'>May be a precedent and witness good</span><br/>
<span id='131'>That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood:</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Join with the present sickness that I have;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And thy unkindness be like crooked age,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>To crop at once a too long wither'd flower.</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!</span><br/>
<span id='136'>These words hereafter thy tormentors be!</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Love they to live that love and honour have.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit, borne off by his Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>And let them die that age and sullens have;</span><br/>
<span id='140'>For both hast thou, and both become the grave.</span><br/>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>I do beseech your majesty, impute his words</span><br/>
<span id='142'>To wayward sickliness and age in him:</span><br/>
<span id='143'>He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear</span><br/>
<span id='144'>As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.</span><br/>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;</span><br/>
<span id='146'>As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter NORTHUMBERLAND</em></p>

<span id='147'>My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.</span><br/>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>What says he?</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='149'>                  Nay, nothing; all is said</span><br/>
<span id='150'>His tongue is now a stringless instrument;</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent.</span><br/>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.</span><br/>

<span id='154'>The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;</span><br/>
<span id='155'>His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.</span><br/>
<span id='156'>So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:</span><br/>
<span id='157'>We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Which live like venom where no venom else</span><br/>
<span id='159'>But only they have privilege to live.</span><br/>
<span id='160'>And for these great affairs do ask some charge,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Towards our assistance we do seize to us</span><br/>
<span id='162'>The plate, corn, revenues and moveables,</span><br/>

<span id='164'>How long shall I be patient? ah, how long</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke</span><br/>
<span id='169'>About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.</span><br/>
<span id='172'>I am the last of noble Edward's sons,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:</span><br/>
<span id='174'>In war was never lion raged more fierce,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Than was that young and princely gentleman.</span><br/>
<span id='177'>His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;</span><br/>
<span id='179'>But when he frown'd, it was against the French</span><br/>
<span id='180'>And not against his friends; his noble hand</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Did will what he did spend and spent not that</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Which his triumphant father's hand had won;</span><br/>
<span id='183'>His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>But bloody with the enemies of his kin.</span><br/>
<span id='185'>O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Or else he never would compare between.</span><br/>

<span id='279'>Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay</span><br/>
<span id='280'>In Brittany, received intelligence</span><br/>
<span id='281'>That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,</span><br/>
<span id='282'>That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,</span><br/>
<span id='283'>His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,</span><br/>
<span id='284'>Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,</span><br/>
<span id='285'>Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,</span><br/>
<span id='286'>All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne</span><br/>
<span id='287'>With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,</span><br/>
<span id='288'>Are making hither with all due expedience</span><br/>
<span id='289'>And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:</span><br/>
<span id='290'>Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay</span><br/>
<span id='291'>The first departing of the king for Ireland.</span><br/>
<span id='292'>If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,</span><br/>

<span id='294'>Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,</span><br/>
<span id='295'>Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt</span><br/>
<span id='296'>And make high majesty look like itself,</span><br/>
<span id='297'>Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;</span><br/>
<span id='298'>But if you faint, as fearing to do so,</span><br/>
<span id='299'>Stay and be secret, and myself will go.</span><br/>

<h1>A Lover's Complaint</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<p>
From off a hill whose concave womb reworded<br/>
A plaintful story from a sist'ring vale,<br/>
My spirits t'attend this double voice accorded,<br/>
And down I laid to list the sad-tun'd tale;<br/>
Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,<br/>
Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,<br/>
Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Upon her head a platted hive of straw,<br/>
Which fortified her visage from the sun,<br/>
Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw<br/>
The carcass of a beauty spent and done;<br/>
Time had not scythed all that youth begun,<br/>
Nor youth all quit, but spite of heaven's fell rage<br/>
Some beauty peeped through lattice of sear'd age.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,<br/>
Which on it had conceited characters,<br/>
Laund'ring the silken figures in the brine<br/>
That seasoned woe had pelleted in tears,<br/>
And often reading what contents it bears;<br/>
As often shrieking undistinguish'd woe,<br/>
In clamours of all size, both high and low.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Sometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride,<br/>
As they did batt'ry to the spheres intend;<br/>
Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied<br/>
To th'orbed earth; sometimes they do extend<br/>
Their view right on; anon their gazes lend<br/>
To every place at once, and nowhere fix'd,<br/>
The mind and sight distractedly commix'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,<br/>
Proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride;<br/>
For some untuck'd descended her sheav'd hat,<br/>
Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;<br/>
Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,<br/>
And, true to bondage, would not break from thence,<br/>
Though slackly braided in loose negligence.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A thousand favours from a maund she drew,<br/>
Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,<br/>
Which one by one she in a river threw,<br/>
Upon whose weeping margent she was set,<br/>
Like usury applying wet to wet,<br/>
Or monarchs' hands, that lets not bounty fall<br/>
Where want cries 'some,' but where excess begs 'all'.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Of folded schedules had she many a one,<br/>
Which she perus'd, sigh'd, tore and gave the flood;<br/>
Crack'd many a ring of posied gold and bone,<br/>
Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;<br/>
Found yet mo letters sadly penn'd in blood,<br/>
With sleided silk, feat and affectedly<br/>
Enswath'd, and seal'd to curious secrecy.<br/>
</p>
<p>
These often bath'd she in her fluxive eyes,<br/>
And often kiss'd, and often gave to tear;<br/>
Cried, 'O false blood, thou register of lies,<br/>
What unapproved witness dost thou bear!<br/>
Ink would have seem'd more black and damned here!'<br/>
This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,<br/>
Big discontent so breaking their contents.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh,<br/>
Sometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew<br/>
Of court, of city, and had let go by<br/>
The swiftest hours observed as they flew,<br/>
Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew;<br/>
And, privileg'd by age, desires to know<br/>
In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So slides he down upon his grained bat,<br/>
And comely distant sits he by her side,<br/>
When he again desires her, being sat,<br/>
Her grievance with his hearing to divide:<br/>
If that from him there may be aught applied<br/>
Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,<br/>
'Tis promised in the charity of age.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Father,' she says, 'though in me you behold<br/>
The injury of many a blasting hour,<br/>
Let it not tell your judgement I am old,<br/>
Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power.<br/>
I might as yet have been a spreading flower,<br/>
Fresh to myself, if I had self-applied<br/>
Love to myself, and to no love beside.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'But woe is me! Too early I attended<br/>
A youthful suit; it was to gain my grace;<br/>
O one by nature's outwards so commended,<br/>
That maiden's eyes stuck over all his face,<br/>
Love lack'd a dwelling and made him her place;<br/>
And when in his fair parts she did abide,<br/>
She was new lodg'd and newly deified.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'His browny locks did hang in crooked curls,<br/>
And every light occasion of the wind<br/>
Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls,<br/>
What's sweet to do, to do will aptly find,<br/>
Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind:<br/>
For on his visage was in little drawn,<br/>
What largeness thinks in paradise was sawn.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Small show of man was yet upon his chin;<br/>
His phoenix down began but to appear,<br/>
Like unshorn velvet, on that termless skin,<br/>
Whose bare out-bragg'd the web it seemed to wear.<br/>
Yet show'd his visage by that cost more dear,<br/>
And nice affections wavering stood in doubt<br/>
If best were as it was, or best without.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'His qualities were beauteous as his form,<br/>
For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;<br/>
Yet if men mov'd him, was he such a storm<br/>
As oft 'twixt May and April is to see,<br/>
When winds breathe sweet, unruly though they be.<br/>
His rudeness so with his authoriz'd youth<br/>
Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Well could he ride, and often men would say<br/>
That horse his mettle from his rider takes,<br/>
Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,<br/>
What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!<br/>
And controversy hence a question takes,<br/>
Whether the horse by him became his deed,<br/>
Or he his manage by th' well-doing steed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'But quickly on this side the verdict went,<br/>
His real habitude gave life and grace<br/>
To appertainings and to ornament,<br/>
Accomplish'd in himself, not in his case;<br/>
All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,<br/>
Came for additions; yet their purpos'd trim<br/>
Piec'd not his grace, but were all grac'd by him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'So on the tip of his subduing tongue<br/>
All kind of arguments and question deep,<br/>
All replication prompt, and reason strong,<br/>
For his advantage still did wake and sleep,<br/>
To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep:<br/>
He had the dialect and different skill,<br/>
Catching all passions in his craft of will.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'That he did in the general bosom reign<br/>
Of young, of old, and sexes both enchanted,<br/>
To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain<br/>
In personal duty, following where he haunted,<br/>
Consent's bewitch'd, ere he desire, have granted,<br/>
And dialogued for him what he would say,<br/>
Ask'd their own wills, and made their wills obey.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Many there were that did his picture get<br/>
To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind,<br/>
Like fools that in th' imagination set<br/>
The goodly objects which abroad they find<br/>
Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign'd,<br/>
And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them,<br/>
Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'So many have, that never touch'd his hand,<br/>
Sweetly suppos'd them mistress of his heart.<br/>
My woeful self that did in freedom stand,<br/>
And was my own fee-simple (not in part)<br/>
What with his art in youth, and youth in art,<br/>
Threw my affections in his charmed power,<br/>
Reserv'd the stalk and gave him all my flower.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Yet did I not, as some my equals did,<br/>
Demand of him, nor being desired yielded,<br/>
Finding myself in honour so forbid,<br/>
With safest distance I mine honour shielded.<br/>
Experience for me many bulwarks builded<br/>
Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil<br/>
Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'But ah! Who ever shunn'd by precedent<br/>
The destin'd ill she must herself assay,<br/>
Or force'd examples 'gainst her own content,<br/>
To put the by-pass'd perils in her way?<br/>
Counsel may stop a while what will not stay:<br/>
For when we rage, advice is often seen<br/>
By blunting us to make our wills more keen.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,<br/>
That we must curb it upon others' proof,<br/>
To be forbode the sweets that seems so good,<br/>
For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.<br/>
O appetite, from judgement stand aloof!<br/>
The one a palate hath that needs will taste,<br/>
Though reason weep and cry, "It is thy last."<br/>
</p>
<p>
'For further I could say, "This man's untrue",<br/>
And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;<br/>
Heard where his plants in others' orchards grew,<br/>
Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;<br/>
Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;<br/>
Thought characters and words merely but art,<br/>
And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'And long upon these terms I held my city,<br/>
Till thus he 'gan besiege me: "Gentle maid,<br/>
Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity,<br/>
And be not of my holy vows afraid:<br/>
That's to ye sworn, to none was ever said,<br/>
For feasts of love I have been call'd unto,<br/>
Till now did ne'er invite, nor never woo.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'"All my offences that abroad you see<br/>
Are errors of the blood, none of the mind:<br/>
Love made them not; with acture they may be,<br/>
Where neither party is nor true nor kind,<br/>
They sought their shame that so their shame did find,<br/>
And so much less of shame in me remains,<br/>
By how much of me their reproach contains.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'"Among the many that mine eyes have seen,<br/>
Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmed,<br/>
Or my affection put to th' smallest teen,<br/>
Or any of my leisures ever charmed:<br/>
Harm have I done to them, but ne'er was harmed;<br/>
Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,<br/>
And reign'd commanding in his monarchy.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'"Look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me,<br/>
Of pallid pearls and rubies red as blood,<br/>
Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me<br/>
Of grief and blushes, aptly understood<br/>
In bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;<br/>
Effects of terror and dear modesty,<br/>
Encamp'd in hearts, but fighting outwardly.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'"And, lo! behold these talents of their hair,<br/>
With twisted metal amorously empleach'd,<br/>
I have receiv'd from many a several fair,<br/>
Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech'd,<br/>
With th' annexions of fair gems enrich'd,<br/>
And deep-brain'd sonnets that did amplify<br/>
Each stone's dear nature, worth and quality.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'"The diamond, why 'twas beautiful and hard,<br/>
Whereto his invis'd properties did tend,<br/>
The deep green emerald, in whose fresh regard<br/>
Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;<br/>
The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend<br/>
With objects manifold; each several stone,<br/>
With wit well blazon'd smil'd, or made some moan.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'"Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,<br/>
Of pensiv'd and subdued desires the tender,<br/>
Nature hath charg'd me that I hoard them not,<br/>
But yield them up where I myself must render,<br/>
That is, to you, my origin and ender:<br/>
For these of force must your oblations be,<br/>
Since I their altar, you empatron me.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'"O then advance of yours that phraseless hand,<br/>
Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;<br/>
Take all these similes to your own command,<br/>
Hallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise:<br/>
What me, your minister for you, obeys,<br/>
Works under you; and to your audit comes<br/>
Their distract parcels in combined sums.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'"Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,<br/>
Or sister sanctified of holiest note,<br/>
Which late her noble suit in court did shun,<br/>
Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;<br/>
For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,<br/>
But kept cold distance, and did thence remove<br/>
To spend her living in eternal love.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'"But O, my sweet, what labour is't to leave<br/>
The thing we have not, mast'ring what not strives,<br/>
Planing the place which did no form receive,<br/>
Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves,<br/>
She that her fame so to herself contrives,<br/>
The scars of battle 'scapeth by the flight,<br/>
And makes her absence valiant, not her might.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'"O pardon me, in that my boast is true,<br/>
The accident which brought me to her eye,<br/>
Upon the moment did her force subdue,<br/>
And now she would the caged cloister fly:<br/>
Religious love put out religion's eye:<br/>
Not to be tempted would she be immur'd,<br/>
And now to tempt all, liberty procur'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'"How mighty then you are, O hear me tell!<br/>
The broken bosoms that to me belong<br/>
Have emptied all their fountains in my well,<br/>
And mine I pour your ocean all among:<br/>
I strong o'er them, and you o'er me being strong,<br/>
Must for your victory us all congest,<br/>
As compound love to physic your cold breast.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'"My parts had pow'r to charm a sacred nun,<br/>
Who, disciplin'd and dieted in grace,<br/>
Believ'd her eyes when they t'assail begun,<br/>
All vows and consecrations giving place.<br/>
O most potential love! Vow, bond, nor space,<br/>
In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,<br/>
For thou art all and all things else are thine.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'"When thou impressest, what are precepts worth<br/>
Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,<br/>
How coldly those impediments stand forth,<br/>
Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!<br/>
Love's arms are peace, 'gainst rule, 'gainst sense, 'gainst shame,<br/>
And sweetens, in the suff'ring pangs it bears,<br/>
The aloes of all forces, shocks and fears.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'"Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,<br/>
Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine,<br/>
And supplicant their sighs to your extend,<br/>
To leave the batt'ry that you make 'gainst mine,<br/>
Lending soft audience to my sweet design,<br/>
And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath,<br/>
That shall prefer and undertake my troth."<br/>
</p>
<p>
'This said, his wat'ry eyes he did dismount,<br/>
Whose sights till then were levell'd on my face;<br/>
Each cheek a river running from a fount<br/>
With brinish current downward flowed apace.<br/>
O how the channel to the stream gave grace!<br/>
Who, glaz'd with crystal gate the glowing roses<br/>
That flame through water which their hue encloses.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies<br/>
In the small orb of one particular tear!<br/>
But with the inundation of the eyes<br/>
What rocky heart to water will not wear?<br/>
What breast so cold that is not warmed here?<br/>
O cleft effect! Cold modesty, hot wrath,<br/>
Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'For lo, his passion, but an art of craft,<br/>
Even there resolv'd my reason into tears;<br/>
There my white stole of chastity I daff'd,<br/>
Shook off my sober guards, and civil fears,<br/>
Appear to him as he to me appears,<br/>
All melting, though our drops this diff'rence bore:<br/>
His poison'd me, and mine did him restore.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'In him a plenitude of subtle matter,<br/>
Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,<br/>
Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,<br/>
Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,<br/>
In either's aptness, as it best deceives,<br/>
To blush at speeches rank, to weep at woes,<br/>
Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'That not a heart which in his level came<br/>
Could 'scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,<br/>
Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;<br/>
And veil'd in them, did win whom he would maim.<br/>
Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;<br/>
When he most burned in heart-wish'd luxury,<br/>
He preach'd pure maid, and prais'd cold chastity.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'Thus merely with the garment of a grace,<br/>
The naked and concealed fiend he cover'd,<br/>
That th'unexperient gave the tempter place,<br/>
Which, like a cherubin, above them hover'd.<br/>
Who, young and simple, would not be so lover'd?<br/>
Ay me! I fell, and yet do question make<br/>
What I should do again for such a sake.<br/>
</p>
<p>
'O, that infected moisture of his eye,<br/>
O, that false fire which in his cheek so glow'd!<br/>
O, that forc'd thunder from his heart did fly,<br/>
O, that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow'd,<br/>
O, all that borrowed motion, seeming owed,<br/>
Would yet again betray the fore-betrayed,<br/>
And new pervert a reconciled maid.'<br/>

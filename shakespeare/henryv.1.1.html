<h1>Henry V</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>London. An ante-chamber in the King's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CANTERBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>But that the scambling and unquiet time</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Did push it out of farther question.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ELY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>CANTERBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>It must be thought on. If it pass against us,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>We lose the better half of our possession:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>For all the temporal lands which men devout</span><br/>
<span id='10'>By testament have given to the church</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Would they strip from us; being valued thus:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And, to relief of lazars and weak age,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>A hundred almshouses right well supplied;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And to the coffers of the king beside,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ELY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>This would drink deep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CANTERBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>'Twould drink the cup and all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ELY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>But what prevention?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CANTERBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>The king is full of grace and fair regard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ELY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>And a true lover of the holy church.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CANTERBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>The courses of his youth promised it not.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>The breath no sooner left his father's body,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>But that his wildness, mortified in him,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Consideration, like an angel, came</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Leaving his body as a paradise,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>To envelop and contain celestial spirits.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Never was such a sudden scholar made;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Never came reformation in a flood,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>With such a heady currance, scouring faults</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness</span><br/>
<span id='37'>So soon did lose his seat and all at once</span><br/>
<span id='38'>As in this king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ELY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>                  We are blessed in the change.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CANTERBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Hear him but reason in divinity,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And all-admiring with an inward wish</span><br/>
<span id='42'>You would desire the king were made a prelate:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>You would say it hath been all in all his study:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>List his discourse of war, and you shall hear</span><br/>
<span id='46'>A fearful battle render'd you in music:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Turn him to any cause of policy,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>So that the art and practic part of life</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Must be the mistress to this theoric:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Since his addiction was to courses vain,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And never noted in him any study,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Any retirement, any sequestration</span><br/>
<span id='61'>From open haunts and popularity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ELY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>The strawberry grows underneath the nettle</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And so the prince obscured his contemplation</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CANTERBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>It must be so; for miracles are ceased;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And therefore we must needs admit the means</span><br/>
<span id='71'>How things are perfected.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ELY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>But, my good lord,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>How now for mitigation of this bill</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Incline to it, or no?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CANTERBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>He seems indifferent,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Or rather swaying more upon our part</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>For I have made an offer to his majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Upon our spiritual convocation</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And in regard of causes now in hand,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Which I have open'd to his grace at large,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>As touching France, to give a greater sum</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Than ever at one time the clergy yet</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Did to his predecessors part withal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ELY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>How did this offer seem received, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CANTERBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>With good acceptance of his majesty;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Save that there was not time enough to hear,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>As I perceived his grace would fain have done,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>The severals and unhidden passages</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And generally to the crown and seat of France</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ELY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>What was the impediment that broke this off?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CANTERBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>The French ambassador upon that instant</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come</span><br/>
<span id='97'>To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ELY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>It is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CANTERBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Then go we in, to know his embassy;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Which I could with a ready guess declare,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ELY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

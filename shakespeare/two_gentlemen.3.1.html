<h1>Two Gentlemen of Verona</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Milan. The Duke's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>We have some secrets to confer about.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit THURIO</em></p>
<span id='3'>Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>My gracious lord, that which I would discover</span><br/>
<span id='5'>The law of friendship bids me to conceal;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>But when I call to mind your gracious favours</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Done to me, undeserving as I am,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>My duty pricks me on to utter that</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Which else no worldly good should draw from me.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>This night intends to steal away your daughter:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Myself am one made privy to the plot.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>I know you have determined to bestow her</span><br/>
<span id='14'>On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And should she thus be stol'n away from you,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>It would be much vexation to your age.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose</span><br/>
<span id='18'>To cross my friend in his intended drift</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Than, by concealing it, heap on your head</span><br/>
<span id='20'>A pack of sorrows which would press you down,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Which to requite, command me while I live.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>This love of theirs myself have often seen,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And oftentimes have purposed to forbid</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Sir Valentine her company and my court:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>But fearing lest my jealous aim might err</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And so unworthily disgrace the man,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find</span><br/>
<span id='32'>That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>The key whereof myself have ever kept;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And thence she cannot be convey'd away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean</span><br/>
<span id='39'>How he her chamber-window will ascend</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And with a corded ladder fetch her down;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>For which the youthful lover now is gone</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And this way comes he with it presently;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly</span><br/>
<span id='45'>That my discovery be not aimed at;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>For love of you, not hate unto my friend,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Hath made me publisher of this pretence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Upon mine honour, he shall never know</span><br/>
<span id='49'>That I had any light from thee of this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter VALENTINE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Please it your grace, there is a messenger</span><br/>
<span id='53'>That stays to bear my letters to my friends,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And I am going to deliver them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Be they of much import?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>The tenor of them doth but signify</span><br/>
<span id='57'>My health and happy being at your court.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>I am to break with thee of some affairs</span><br/>
<span id='60'>That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought</span><br/>
<span id='62'>To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Neither regarding that she is my child</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Nor fearing me as if I were her father;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And, where I thought the remnant of mine age</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>I now am full resolved to take a wife</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And turn her out to who will take her in:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>For me and my possessions she esteems not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>What would your Grace have me to do in this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>There is a lady in Verona here</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And nought esteems my aged eloquence:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>For long agone I have forgot to court;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Besides, the fashion of the time is changed&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>How and which way I may bestow myself</span><br/>
<span id='88'>To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Dumb jewels often in their silent kind</span><br/>
<span id='91'>More than quick words do move a woman's mind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>But she did scorn a present that I sent her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Send her another; never give her o'er;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>For scorn at first makes after-love the more.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>But rather to beget more love in you:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>But she I mean is promised by her friends</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And kept severely from resort of men,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>That no man hath access by day to her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Why, then, I would resort to her by night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>That no man hath recourse to her by night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>What lets but one may enter at her window?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And built so shelving that one cannot climb it</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Without apparent hazard of his life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>So bold Leander would adventure it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Advise me where I may have such a ladder.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>This very night; for Love is like a child,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>That longs for every thing that he can come by.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:</span><br/>
<span id='128'>How shall I best convey the ladder thither?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Under a cloak that is of any length.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Ay, my good lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>                  Then let me see thy cloak:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>I'll get me one of such another length.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?</span><br/>
<span id='137'>I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.</span><br/>
<span id='138'>What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!</span><br/>
<span id='139'>And here an engine fit for my proceeding.</span><br/>
<span id='140'>I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='141'>'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>And slaves they are to me that send them flying:</span><br/>
<span id='143'>O, could their master come and go as lightly,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!</span><br/>
<span id='145'>My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:</span><br/>
<span id='146'>While I, their king, that hither them importune,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Because myself do want my servants' fortune:</span><br/>
<span id='149'>I curse myself, for they are sent by me,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>That they should harbour where their lord would be.'</span><br/>
<span id='151'>What's here?</span><br/>
<span id='152'>'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'</span><br/>
<span id='153'>'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Why, Phaeton,&mdash;for thou art Merops' son,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car</span><br/>
<span id='156'>And with thy daring folly burn the world?</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Go, base intruder! overweening slave!</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>And think my patience, more than thy desert,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Is privilege for thy departure hence:</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Thank me for this more than for all the favours</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.</span><br/>
<span id='164'>But if thou linger in my territories</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Longer than swiftest expedition</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Will give thee time to leave our royal court,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love</span><br/>
<span id='168'>I ever bore my daughter or thyself.</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;</span><br/>
<span id='170'>But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>And why not death rather than living torment?</span><br/>
<span id='172'>To die is to be banish'd from myself;</span><br/>
<span id='173'>And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Is self from self: a deadly banishment!</span><br/>
<span id='175'>What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?</span><br/>
<span id='176'>What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Unless it be to think that she is by</span><br/>
<span id='178'>And feed upon the shadow of perfection</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Except I be by Silvia in the night,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>There is no music in the nightingale;</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Unless I look on Silvia in the day,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>There is no day for me to look upon;</span><br/>
<span id='183'>She is my essence, and I leave to be,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>If I be not by her fair influence</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.</span><br/>
<span id='186'>I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Tarry I here, I but attend on death:</span><br/>
<span id='188'>But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></span>

<span id='190'>Soho, soho!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>What seest thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Him we go to find: there's not a hair on's head</span><br/>
<span id='193'>but 'tis a Valentine.</span><br/>

<span id='speech41'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>Valentine?</span><br/>

<span id='195'>No.</span><br/>

<span id='196'>Who then? his spirit?</span><br/>

<span id='197'>Neither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>What then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>Nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>Who wouldst thou strike?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>Nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>Villain, forbear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>Why, sir, I'll strike nothing: I pray you,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>So much of bad already hath possess'd them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>Is Silvia dead?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='211'>No, Valentine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='212'>No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.</span><br/>
<span id='213'>Hath she forsworn me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>No, Valentine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='215'>No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.</span><br/>
<span id='216'>What is your news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>That thou art banished&mdash;O, that's the news!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='219'>From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='220'>O, I have fed upon this woe already,</span><br/>
<span id='221'>And now excess of it will make me surfeit.</span><br/>
<span id='222'>Doth Silvia know that I am banished?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='223'>Ay, ay; and she hath offer'd to the doom&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='224'>Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='225'>A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;</span><br/>
<span id='227'>With them, upon her knees, her humble self;</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them</span><br/>
<span id='229'>As if but now they waxed pale for woe:</span><br/>
<span id='230'>But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,</span><br/>
<span id='232'>Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;</span><br/>
<span id='233'>But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.</span><br/>
<span id='234'>Besides, her intercession chafed him so,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>When she for thy repeal was suppliant,</span><br/>
<span id='236'>That to close prison he commanded her,</span><br/>
<span id='237'>With many bitter threats of biding there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='238'>No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st</span><br/>
<span id='239'>Have some malignant power upon my life:</span><br/>
<span id='240'>If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,</span><br/>
<span id='241'>As ending anthem of my endless dolour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='242'>Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,</span><br/>
<span id='243'>And study help for that which thou lament'st.</span><br/>
<span id='244'>Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.</span><br/>
<span id='245'>Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;</span><br/>
<span id='246'>Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.</span><br/>
<span id='247'>Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that</span><br/>
<span id='248'>And manage it against despairing thoughts.</span><br/>
<span id='249'>Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence;</span><br/>
<span id='250'>Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'd</span><br/>
<span id='251'>Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.</span><br/>
<span id='252'>The time now serves not to expostulate:</span><br/>
<span id='253'>Come, I'll convey thee through the city-gate;</span><br/>
<span id='254'>And, ere I part with thee, confer at large</span><br/>
<span id='255'>Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.</span><br/>
<span id='256'>As thou lovest Silvia, though not for thyself,</span><br/>
<span id='257'>Regard thy danger, and along with me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='258'>I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,</span><br/>
<span id='259'>Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='260'>Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='261'>O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt VALENTINE and PROTEUS</em></p>

<h1>Henry VI, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Orleans.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter, on the walls, a Master Gunner and his Boy</em>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Master-Gunner	Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is besieged,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And how the English have the suburbs won.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Boy</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Father, I know; and oft have shot at them,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Master-Gunner	But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Chief master-gunner am I of this town;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Something I must do to procure me grace.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>The prince's espials have informed me</span><br/>
<span id='9'>How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars</span><br/>
<span id='11'>In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And thence discover how with most advantage</span><br/>
<span id='13'>They may vex us with shot, or with assault.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>To intercept this inconvenience,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And even these three days have I watch'd,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>If I could see them.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And thou shalt find me at the governor's.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Boy</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Father, I warrant you; take you no care;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter, on the turrets, SALISBURY and TALBOT, GLANSDALE, GARGRAVE, and others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Talbot, my life, my joy, again return'd!</span><br/>
<span id='24'>How wert thou handled being prisoner?</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Or by what means got'st thou to be released?</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>TALBOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>For him was I exchanged and ransomed.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But with a baser man of arms by far</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Which I, disdaining, scorn'd; and craved death,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>In fine, redeem'd I was as I desired.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Whom with my bare fists I would execute,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>If I now had him brought into my power.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>TALBOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>In open market-place produced they me,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>To be a public spectacle to all:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Here, said they, is the terror of the French,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>The scarecrow that affrights our children so.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Then broke I from the officers that led me,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>To hurl at the beholders of my shame:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>My grisly countenance made others fly;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>None durst come near for fear of sudden death.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>That walked about me every minute-while;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And if I did but stir out of my bed,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the Boy with a linstock</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>I grieve to hear what torments you endured,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>But we will be revenged sufficiently</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Now it is supper-time in Orleans:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Here, through this grate, I count each one</span><br/>
<span id='61'>and view the Frenchmen how they fortify:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Let me have your express opinions</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Where is best place to make our battery next.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>GARGRAVE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>I think, at the north gate; for there stand lords.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GLANSDALE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>TALBOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>For aught I see, this city must be famish'd,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.</span><br/>
<p><em>Here they shoot. SALISBURY and GARGRAVE fall</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GARGRAVE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>TALBOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>How farest thou, mirror of all martial men?</span><br/>
<span id='75'>One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand</span><br/>
<span id='77'>That hath contrived this woful tragedy!</span><br/>
<span id='78'>In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Yet livest thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Thou shalt not die whiles&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Remember to avenge me on the French.'</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Wretched shall France be only in my name.</span><br/>
<p><em>Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens</em></p>
<span id='98'>What stir is this? what tumult's in the heavens?</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>My lord, my lord, the French have gathered head:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join'd,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>A holy prophetess new risen up,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Is come with a great power to raise the siege.</span><br/>
<p><em>Here SALISBURY lifteth himself up and groans</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TALBOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!</span><br/>
<span id='105'>It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Convey me Salisbury into his tent,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.</span><br/>
<p><em>Alarum. Exeunt</em></p>

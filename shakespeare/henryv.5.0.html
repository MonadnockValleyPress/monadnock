<h1>Henry V</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Prologue</h3>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Chorus</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Chorus</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>That I may prompt them: and of such as have,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>I humbly pray them to admit the excuse</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Of time, of numbers and due course of things,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Which cannot in their huge and proper life</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Be here presented. Now we bear the king</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Toward Calais: grant him there; there seen,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Heave him away upon your winged thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth'd sea,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Seems to prepare his way: so let him land,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And solemnly see him set on to London.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>So swift a pace hath thought that even now</span><br/>
<span id='16'>You may imagine him upon Blackheath;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Where that his lords desire him to have borne</span><br/>
<span id='18'>His bruised helmet and his bended sword</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Before him through the city: he forbids it,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Giving full trophy, signal and ostent</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Quite from himself to God. But now behold,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>In the quick forge and working-house of thought,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>How London doth pour out her citizens!</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Like to the senators of the antique Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>With the plebeians swarming at their heels,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>As, by a lower but loving likelihood,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Were now the general of our gracious empress,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>How many would the peaceful city quit,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>As yet the lamentation of the French</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Invites the King of England's stay at home;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>The emperor's coming in behalf of France,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To order peace between them; and omit</span><br/>
<span id='40'>All the occurrences, whatever chanced,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Till Harry's back-return again to France:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>There must we bring him; and myself have play'd</span><br/>
<span id='43'>The interim, by remembering you 'tis past.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>After your thoughts, straight back again to France.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<h1>Timon of Athens</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>The woods. Before Timon's cave.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Poet and Painter; TIMON watching them from his cave</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Painter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where</span><br/>
<span id='2'>he abides.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Poet</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>What's to be thought of him? does the rumour hold</span><br/>
<span id='4'>for true, that he's so full of gold?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>Painter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor</span><br/>
<span id='7'>straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said</span><br/>
<span id='8'>he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Poet</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Painter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens</span><br/>
<span id='11'>again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore</span><br/>
<span id='12'>'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this</span><br/>
<span id='13'>supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in</span><br/>
<span id='14'>us; and is very likely to load our purposes with</span><br/>
<span id='15'>what they travail for, if it be a just true report</span><br/>
<span id='16'>that goes of his having.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Poet</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>What have you now to present unto him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Painter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I will</span><br/>
<span id='19'>promise him an excellent piece.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Poet</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent</span><br/>
<span id='21'>that's coming toward him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Painter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the</span><br/>
<span id='23'>time: it opens the eyes of expectation:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>performance is ever the duller for his act; and,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the</span><br/>
<span id='26'>deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is</span><br/>
<span id='27'>most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind</span><br/>
<span id='28'>of will or testament which argues a great sickness</span><br/>
<span id='29'>in his judgment that makes it.</span><br/>
<p><em>TIMON comes from his cave, behind</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>[Aside]  Excellent workman! thou canst not paint a</span><br/>
<span id='31'>man so bad as is thyself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Poet</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for</span><br/>
<span id='33'>him: it must be a personating of himself; a satire</span><br/>
<span id='34'>against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery</span><br/>
<span id='35'>of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>[Aside]  Must thou needs stand for a villain in</span><br/>
<span id='37'>thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in</span><br/>
<span id='38'>other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Poet</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Nay, let's seek him:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Then do we sin against our own estate,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>When we may profit meet, and come too late.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Painter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>True;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>When the day serves, before black-corner'd night,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light. Come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>[Aside]  I'll meet you at the turn. What a</span><br/>
<span id='46'>god's gold,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Than where swine feed!</span><br/>
<span id='49'>'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Settlest admired reverence in a slave:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey!</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Fit I meet them.</span><br/>
<p><em>Coming forward</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Poet</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Hail, worthy Timon!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Painter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Our late noble master!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Have I once lived to see two honest men?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Poet</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Sir,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Having often of your open bounty tasted,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Hearing you were retired, your friends fall'n off,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Whose thankless natures&mdash;O abhorred spirits!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>What! to you,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence</span><br/>
<span id='64'>To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover</span><br/>
<span id='65'>The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude</span><br/>
<span id='66'>With any size of words.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Let it go naked, men may see't the better:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>You that are honest, by being what you are,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Make them best seen and known.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Painter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>He and myself</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Have travail'd in the great shower of your gifts,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And sweetly felt it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Ay, you are honest men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Painter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>We are hither come to offer you our service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Both</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Ye're honest men: ye've heard that I have gold;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>I am sure you have: speak truth; ye're honest men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Painter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>So it is said, my noble lord; but therefore</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Came not my friend nor I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Best in all Athens: thou'rt, indeed, the best;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Thou counterfeit'st most lively.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Painter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>So, so, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>E'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth</span><br/>
<span id='88'>That thou art even natural in thine art.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>I must needs say you have a little fault:</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I</span><br/>
<span id='92'>You take much pains to mend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>Both</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Beseech your honour</span><br/>
<span id='94'>To make it known to us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>You'll take it ill.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>Both</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Most thankfully, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Will you, indeed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>Both</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Doubt it not, worthy lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>There's never a one of you but trusts a knave,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>That mightily deceives you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>Both</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Do we, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured</span><br/>
<span id='105'>That he's a made-up villain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>Painter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>I know none such, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Poet</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Nor I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Rid me these villains from your companies:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Confound them by some course, and come to me,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>I'll give you gold enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Both</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Name them, my lord, let's know them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>You that way and you this, but two in company;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Each man apart, all single and alone,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.</span><br/>
<span id='117'>If where thou art two villains shall not be,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside</span><br/>
<span id='119'>But where one villain is, then him abandon.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:</span><br/>
<p><em>To Painter</em></p>
<span id='121'>You have work'd for me; there's payment for you: hence!</span><br/>
<p><em>To Poet</em></p>
<span id='122'>You are an alchemist; make gold of that.</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Out, rascal dogs!</span><br/>
<p><em>Beats them out, and then retires to his cave</em></p>
<p><em>Enter FLAVIUS and two Senators</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>FLAVIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>It is in vain that you would speak with Timon;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>For he is set so only to himself</span><br/>
<span id='126'>That nothing but himself which looks like man</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Is friendly with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Bring us to his cave:</span><br/>
<span id='129'>It is our part and promise to the Athenians</span><br/>
<span id='130'>To speak with Timon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Second Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>At all times alike</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs</span><br/>
<span id='133'>That framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Offering the fortunes of his former days,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>The former man may make him. Bring us to him,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And chance it as it may.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>FLAVIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Here is his cave.</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Look out, and speak to friends: the Athenians,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee:</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Speak to them, noble Timon.</span><br/>
<p><em>TIMON comes from his cave</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Thou sun, that comfort'st, burn! Speak, and</span><br/>
<span id='143'>be hang'd:</span><br/>
<span id='144'>For each true word, a blister! and each false</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Be as cauterizing to the root o' the tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Consuming it with speaking!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Worthy Timon,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>I thank them; and would send them back the plague,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Could I but catch it for them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>O, forget</span><br/>
<span id='153'>What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.</span><br/>
<span id='154'>The senators with one consent of love</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought</span><br/>
<span id='156'>On special dignities, which vacant lie</span><br/>
<span id='157'>For thy best use and wearing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>Second Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>They confess</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Toward thee forgetfulness too general, gross:</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Which now the public body, which doth seldom</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Play the recanter, feeling in itself</span><br/>
<span id='162'>A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon;</span><br/>
<span id='164'>And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Together with a recompense more fruitful</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth</span><br/>
<span id='168'>As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs</span><br/>
<span id='169'>And write in thee the figures of their love,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Ever to read them thine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>You witch me in it;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Surprise me to the very brink of tears:</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>Therefore, so please thee to return with us</span><br/>
<span id='176'>And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take</span><br/>
<span id='177'>The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Allow'd with absolute power and thy good name</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up</span><br/>
<span id='182'>His country's peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>Second Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>And shakes his threatening sword</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Against the walls of Athens.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>Therefore, Timon,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:</span><br/>
<span id='187'>If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>And take our goodly aged men by the beards,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Giving our holy virgins to the stain</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>In pity of our aged and our youth,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>While you have throats to answer: for myself,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>There's not a whittle in the unruly camp</span><br/>
<span id='199'>But I do prize it at my love before</span><br/>
<span id='200'>The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you</span><br/>
<span id='201'>To the protection of the prosperous gods,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>As thieves to keepers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>FLAVIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>Stay not, all's in vain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>Why, I was writing of my epitaph;</span><br/>
<span id='205'>it will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Of health and living now begins to mend,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>And last so long enough!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>We speak in vain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='211'>But yet I love my country, and am not</span><br/>
<span id='212'>One that rejoices in the common wreck,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>As common bruit doth put it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>That's well spoke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='215'>Commend me to my loving countrymen,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>These words become your lips as they pass</span><br/>
<span id='217'>thorough them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>Second Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>And enter in our ears like great triumphers</span><br/>
<span id='219'>In their applauding gates.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='220'>Commend me to them,</span><br/>
<span id='221'>And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,</span><br/>
<span id='222'>Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,</span><br/>
<span id='223'>Their pangs of love, with other incident throes</span><br/>
<span id='224'>That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain</span><br/>
<span id='225'>In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:</span><br/>
<span id='226'>I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='227'>I like this well; he will return again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='228'>I have a tree, which grows here in my close,</span><br/>
<span id='229'>That mine own use invites me to cut down,</span><br/>
<span id='230'>And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree</span><br/>
<span id='232'>From high to low throughout, that whoso please</span><br/>
<span id='233'>To stop affliction, let him take his haste,</span><br/>
<span id='234'>Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>FLAVIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='236'>Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='237'>Come not to me again: but say to Athens,</span><br/>
<span id='238'>Timon hath made his everlasting mansion</span><br/>
<span id='239'>Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;</span><br/>
<span id='240'>Who once a day with his embossed froth</span><br/>
<span id='241'>The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,</span><br/>
<span id='242'>And let my grave-stone be your oracle.</span><br/>
<span id='243'>Lips, let sour words go by and language end:</span><br/>
<span id='244'>What is amiss plague and infection mend!</span><br/>
<span id='245'>Graves only be men's works and death their gain!</span><br/>
<span id='246'>Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.</span><br/>
<p><em>Retires to his cave</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='247'>His discontents are unremoveably</span><br/>
<span id='248'>Coupled to nature.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>Second Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='249'>Our hope in him is dead: let us return,</span><br/>
<span id='250'>And strain what other means is left unto us</span><br/>
<span id='251'>In our dear peril.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>

<span id='252'>                  It requires swift foot.</span><br/>

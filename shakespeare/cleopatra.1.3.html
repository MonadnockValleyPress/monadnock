<h1>Antony and Cleopatra</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The same. Another room.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Where is he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CHARMIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>                  I did not see him since.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>See where he is, who's with him, what he does:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>I did not send you: if you find him sad,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report</span><br/>
<span id='6'>That I am sudden sick: quick, and return.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit ALEXAS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CHARMIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>You do not hold the method to enforce</span><br/>
<span id='9'>The like from him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>                  What should I do, I do not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CHARMIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>In each thing give him way, cross him nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CHARMIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>In time we hate that which we often fear.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>But here comes Antony.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MARK ANTONY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>I am sick and sullen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Will not sustain it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Now, my dearest queen,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Pray you, stand further from me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>What's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>What says the married woman? You may go:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Would she had never given you leave to come!</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I have no power upon you; hers you are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>The gods best know,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>O, never was there queen</span><br/>
<span id='31'>So mightily betray'd! yet at the first</span><br/>
<span id='32'>I saw the treasons planted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Cleopatra,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Why should I think you can be mine and true,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Which break themselves in swearing!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Most sweet queen,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Then was the time for words: no going then;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Eternity was in our lips and eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>But was a race of heaven: they are so still,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Art turn'd the greatest liar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>How now, lady!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know</span><br/>
<span id='50'>There were a heart in Egypt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Hear me, queen:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The strong necessity of time commands</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Our services awhile; but my full heart</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Remains in use with you. Our Italy</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Equality of two domestic powers</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Into the hearts of such as have not thrived</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge</span><br/>
<span id='64'>By any desperate change: my more particular,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And that which most with you should safe my going,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Is Fulvia's death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Though age from folly could not give me freedom,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>She's dead, my queen:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read</span><br/>
<span id='71'>The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>See when and where she died.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>O most false love!</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill</span><br/>
<span id='75'>With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know</span><br/>
<span id='78'>The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>As you shall give the advice. By the fire</span><br/>
<span id='80'>That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war</span><br/>
<span id='82'>As thou affect'st.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>                  Cut my lace, Charmian, come;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>So Antony loves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>                  My precious queen, forbear;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And give true evidence to his love, which stands</span><br/>
<span id='88'>An honourable trial.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>So Fulvia told me.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Of excellent dissembling; and let it look</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Life perfect honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>You'll heat my blood: no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>You can do better yet; but this is meetly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Now, by my sword,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>And target. Still he mends;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>How this Herculean Roman does become</span><br/>
<span id='101'>The carriage of his chafe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>I'll leave you, lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Courteous lord, one word.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>That you know well: something it is I would,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>O, my oblivion is a very Antony,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And I am all forgotten.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>But that your royalty</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Holds idleness your subject, I should take you</span><br/>
<span id='111'>For idleness itself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>'Tis sweating labour</span><br/>
<span id='113'>To bear such idleness so near the heart</span><br/>
<span id='114'>As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Since my becomings kill me, when they do not</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>And all the gods go with you! upon your sword</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Sit laurel victory! and smooth success</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Be strew'd before your feet!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Let us go. Come;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Our separation so abides, and flies,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

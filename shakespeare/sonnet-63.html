<h3>LXIII</h3>
<p>
Against my love shall be as I am now,<br/>
With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn;<br/>
When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow<br/>
With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn<br/>
Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night;<br/>
And all those beauties whereof now he's king<br/>
Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,<br/>
Stealing away the treasure of his spring; <br/>
For such a time do I now fortify<br/>
Against confounding age's cruel knife,<br/>
That he shall never cut from memory<br/>
My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they shall live, and he in them still green.<br/>

<h1>Henry IV, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The rebel camp.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter WORCESTER and VERNON</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>O, no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The liberal and kind offer of the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>VERNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>'Twere best he did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Then are we all undone.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>It is not possible, it cannot be,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>The king should keep his word in loving us;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>He will suspect us still and find a time</span><br/>
<span id='8'>To punish this offence in other faults:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>For treason is but trusted like the fox,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Look how we can, or sad or merrily,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Interpretation will misquote our looks,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And an adopted name of privilege,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>All his offences live upon my head</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And on his father's; we did train him on,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And, his corruption being ta'en from us,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>In any case, the offer of the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>VERNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Deliver what you will; I'll say 'tis so.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Here comes your cousin.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HOTSPUR and DOUGLAS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>My uncle is return'd:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Uncle, what news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>The king will bid you battle presently.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>EARL OF DOUGLAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>EARL OF DOUGLAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Marry, and shall, and very willingly.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>There is no seeming mercy in the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Did you beg any? God forbid!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>I told him gently of our grievances,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>By now forswearing that he is forsworn:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge</span><br/>
<span id='42'>With haughty arms this hateful name in us.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter the EARL OF DOUGLAS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>EARL OF DOUGLAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Arm, gentlemen; to arms! for I have thrown</span><br/>
<span id='44'>A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And that no man might draw short breath today</span><br/>
<span id='51'>But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>VERNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>No, by my soul; I never in my life</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Unless a brother should a brother dare</span><br/>
<span id='56'>To gentle exercise and proof of arms.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>He gave you all the duties of a man;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Making you ever better than his praise</span><br/>
<span id='61'>By still dispraising praise valued in you;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And, which became him like a prince indeed,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>He made a blushing cital of himself;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And chid his truant youth with such a grace</span><br/>
<span id='65'>As if he master'd there a double spirit</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Of teaching and of learning instantly.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>There did he pause: but let me tell the world,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>If he outlive the envy of this day,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>England did never owe so sweet a hope,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>So much misconstrued in his wantonness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Cousin, I think thou art enamoured</span><br/>
<span id='72'>On his follies: never did I hear</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Of any prince so wild a libertine.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>But be he as he will, yet once ere night</span><br/>
<span id='75'>I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>That he shall shrink under my courtesy.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Arm, arm with speed: and, fellows, soldiers, friends,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Better consider what you have to do</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Can lift your blood up with persuasion.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>My lord, here are letters for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>I cannot read them now.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>O gentlemen, the time of life is short!</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To spend that shortness basely were too long,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>If life did ride upon a dial's point,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Still ending at the arrival of an hour.</span><br/>
<span id='87'>An if we live, we live to tread on kings;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>If die, brave death, when princes die with us!</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>When the intent of bearing them is just.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter another Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>My lord, prepare; the king comes on apace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>For I profess not talking; only this&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Let each man do his best: and here draw I</span><br/>
<span id='95'>A sword, whose temper I intend to stain</span><br/>
<span id='96'>With the best blood that I can meet withal</span><br/>
<span id='97'>In the adventure of this perilous day.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Sound all the lofty instruments of war,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And by that music let us all embrace;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall</span><br/>
<span id='102'>A second time do such a courtesy.</span><br/>
<p><em>The trumpets sound. They embrace, and exeunt</em></p>

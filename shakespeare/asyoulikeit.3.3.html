<h1>As You Like It</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene III</H3>
<h4>The forest.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your</span><br/>
<span id='2'>goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?</span><br/>
<span id='3'>doth my simple feature content you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>AUDREY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most</span><br/>
<span id='6'>capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>JAQUES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>[Aside]  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove</span><br/>
<span id='8'>in a thatched house!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a</span><br/>
<span id='10'>man's good wit seconded with the forward child</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a</span><br/>
<span id='12'>great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would</span><br/>
<span id='13'>the gods had made thee poetical.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>AUDREY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in</span><br/>
<span id='15'>deed and word? is it a true thing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most</span><br/>
<span id='17'>feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what</span><br/>
<span id='18'>they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>AUDREY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art</span><br/>
<span id='21'>honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some</span><br/>
<span id='22'>hope thou didst feign.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>AUDREY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Would you not have me honest?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for</span><br/>
<span id='25'>honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>JAQUES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>[Aside]  A material fool!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>AUDREY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'> Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods</span><br/>
<span id='28'>make me honest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut</span><br/>
<span id='30'>were to put good meat into an unclean dish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>AUDREY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!</span><br/>
<span id='33'>sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may</span><br/>
<span id='34'>be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been</span><br/>
<span id='35'>with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next</span><br/>
<span id='36'>village, who hath promised to meet me in this place</span><br/>
<span id='37'>of the forest and to couple us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>JAQUES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>[Aside]  I would fain see this meeting.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>AUDREY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Well, the gods give us joy!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple</span><br/>
<span id='42'>but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what</span><br/>
<span id='43'>though? C ourage! As horns are odious, they are</span><br/>
<span id='44'>necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of</span><br/>
<span id='45'>his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and</span><br/>
<span id='46'>knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of</span><br/>
<span id='47'>his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer</span><br/>
<span id='49'>hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man</span><br/>
<span id='50'>therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more</span><br/>
<span id='51'>worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a</span><br/>
<span id='52'>married man more honourable than the bare brow of a</span><br/>
<span id='53'>bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no</span><br/>
<span id='54'>skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to</span><br/>
<span id='55'>want. Here comes Sir Oliver.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</em></p>
<span id='56'>Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you</span><br/>
<span id='57'>dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go</span><br/>
<span id='58'>with you to your chapel?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Is there none here to give the woman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>I will not take her on gift of any man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>JAQUES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>[Advancing]</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Proceed, proceed	I'll give her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your</span><br/>
<span id='66'>last company: I am very glad to see you: even a</span><br/>
<span id='67'>toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>JAQUES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Will you be married, motley?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and</span><br/>
<span id='70'>the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and</span><br/>
<span id='71'>as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>JAQUES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>And will you, being a man of your breeding, be</span><br/>
<span id='73'>married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to</span><br/>
<span id='74'>church, and have a good priest that can tell you</span><br/>
<span id='75'>what marriage is: this fellow will but join you</span><br/>
<span id='76'>together as they join wainscot; then one of you will</span><br/>
<span id='77'>prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>[Aside]  I am not in the mind but I were better to be</span><br/>
<span id='79'>married of him than of another: for he is not like</span><br/>
<span id='80'>to marry me well; and not being well married, it</span><br/>
<span id='81'>will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>JAQUES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>'Come, sweet Audrey:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>O sweet Oliver,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>O brave Oliver,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Leave me not behind thee: but,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Wind away,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Begone, I say,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>I will not to wedding with thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>'Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of them</span><br/>
<span id='93'>all shall flout me out of my calling.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

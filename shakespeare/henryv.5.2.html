<h4>France. A royal palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter, at one door KING HENRY, EXETER, BEDFORD,  GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and other Lords;  at another, the FRENCH KING, QUEEN ISABEL, the  PRINCESS KATHARINE, ALICE and other Ladies; the DUKE of BURGUNDY, and his train</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met!</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Unto our brother France, and to our sister,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Health and fair time of day; joy and good wishes</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To our most fair and princely cousin Katharine;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And, as a branch and member of this royalty,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>By whom this great assembly is contrived,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And, princes French, and peers, health to you all!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Right joyous are we to behold your face,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Most worthy brother England; fairly met:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>So are you, princes English, every one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>QUEEN ISABEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>So happy be the issue, brother England,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Of this good day and of this gracious meeting,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>As we are now glad to behold your eyes;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Your eyes, which hitherto have borne in them</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Against the French, that met them in their bent,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>The fatal balls of murdering basilisks:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Have lost their quality, and that this day</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>To cry amen to that, thus we appear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>QUEEN ISABEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>You English princes all, I do salute you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>My duty to you both, on equal love,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Great Kings of France and England! That I have labour'd,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>With all my wits, my pains and strong endeavours,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>To bring your most imperial majesties</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Unto this bar and royal interview,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Since then my office hath so far prevail'd</span><br/>
<span id='30'>That, face to face and royal eye to eye,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>If I demand, before this royal view,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>What rub or what impediment there is,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Why that the naked, poor and mangled Peace,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Dear nurse of arts and joyful births,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Should not in this best garden of the world</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Corrupting in its own fertility.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach'd,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Put forth disorder'd twigs; her fallow leas</span><br/>
<span id='45'>The darnel, hemlock and rank fumitory</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts</span><br/>
<span id='47'>That should deracinate such savagery;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth</span><br/>
<span id='49'>The freckled cowslip, burnet and green clover,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Conceives by idleness and nothing teems</span><br/>
<span id='52'>But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Losing both beauty and utility.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And as our vineyards, fallows, meads and hedges,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Defective in their natures, grow to wildness,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Even so our houses and ourselves and children</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>The sciences that should become our country;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>But grow like savages,&mdash;as soldiers will</span><br/>
<span id='60'>That nothing do but meditate on blood,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>To swearing and stern looks, diffused attire</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And every thing that seems unnatural.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Which to reduce into our former favour</span><br/>
<span id='64'>You are assembled: and my speech entreats</span><br/>
<span id='65'>That I may know the let, why gentle Peace</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Should not expel these inconveniences</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And bless us with her former qualities.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Whose want gives growth to the imperfections</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Which you have cited, you must buy that peace</span><br/>
<span id='71'>With full accord to all our just demands;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Whose tenors and particular effects</span><br/>
<span id='73'>You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>The king hath heard them; to the which as yet</span><br/>
<span id='75'>There is no answer made.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Well then the peace,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Which you before so urged, lies in his answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>I have but with a cursorary eye</span><br/>
<span id='79'>O'erglanced the articles: pleaseth your grace</span><br/>
<span id='80'>To appoint some of your council presently</span><br/>
<span id='81'>To sit with us once more, with better heed</span><br/>
<span id='82'>To re-survey them, we will suddenly</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Pass our accept and peremptory answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Brother, we shall. Go, uncle Exeter,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Warwick and Huntingdon, go with the king;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And take with you free power to ratify,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Shall see advantageable for our dignity,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Any thing in or out of our demands,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And we'll consign thereto. Will you, fair sister,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Go with the princes, or stay here with us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>QUEEN ISABEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Our gracious brother, I will go with them:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Haply a woman's voice may do some good,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>When articles too nicely urged be stood on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>She is our capital demand, comprised</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Within the fore-rank of our articles.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>QUEEN ISABEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>She hath good leave.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all except HENRY, KATHARINE, and ALICE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Fair Katharine, and most fair,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Such as will enter at a lady's ear</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with</span><br/>
<span id='106'>your French heart, I will be glad to hear you</span><br/>
<span id='107'>confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do</span><br/>
<span id='108'>you like me, Kate?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is 'like me.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Que dit-il? que je suis semblable a les anges?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ALICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>I said so, dear Katharine; and I must not blush to</span><br/>
<span id='114'>affirm it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de</span><br/>
<span id='116'>tromperies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>What says she, fair one? that the tongues of men</span><br/>
<span id='118'>are full of deceits?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ALICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of</span><br/>
<span id='120'>deceits: dat is de princess.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am</span><br/>
<span id='123'>glad thou canst speak no better English; for, if</span><br/>
<span id='124'>thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king</span><br/>
<span id='125'>that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my</span><br/>
<span id='126'>crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but</span><br/>
<span id='127'>directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me</span><br/>
<span id='128'>farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out</span><br/>
<span id='129'>my suit. Give me your answer; i' faith, do: and so</span><br/>
<span id='130'>clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for</span><br/>
<span id='133'>your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I</span><br/>
<span id='134'>have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I</span><br/>
<span id='135'>have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable</span><br/>
<span id='136'>measure in strength. If I could win a lady at</span><br/>
<span id='137'>leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my</span><br/>
<span id='138'>armour on my back, under the correction of bragging</span><br/>
<span id='139'>be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse</span><br/>
<span id='141'>for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and</span><br/>
<span id='142'>sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my</span><br/>
<span id='144'>eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;</span><br/>
<span id='145'>only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a</span><br/>
<span id='147'>fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth</span><br/>
<span id='148'>sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love</span><br/>
<span id='149'>of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy</span><br/>
<span id='150'>cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst</span><br/>
<span id='151'>love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee</span><br/>
<span id='152'>that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou</span><br/>
<span id='154'>livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and</span><br/>
<span id='155'>uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee</span><br/>
<span id='156'>right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other</span><br/>
<span id='157'>places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that</span><br/>
<span id='158'>can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do</span><br/>
<span id='159'>always reason themselves out again. What! a</span><br/>
<span id='160'>speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A</span><br/>
<span id='161'>good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a</span><br/>
<span id='162'>black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow</span><br/>
<span id='163'>bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax</span><br/>
<span id='164'>hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the</span><br/>
<span id='165'>moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it</span><br/>
<span id='166'>shines bright and never changes, but keeps his</span><br/>
<span id='167'>course truly. If thou would have such a one, take</span><br/>
<span id='168'>me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?</span><br/>
<span id='170'>speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of</span><br/>
<span id='173'>France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love</span><br/>
<span id='174'>the friend of France; for I love France so well that</span><br/>
<span id='175'>I will not part with a village of it; I will have it</span><br/>
<span id='176'>all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am</span><br/>
<span id='177'>yours, then yours is France and you are mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>I cannot tell vat is dat.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am</span><br/>
<span id='180'>sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married</span><br/>
<span id='181'>wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook</span><br/>
<span id='182'>off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand</span><br/>
<span id='183'>vous avez le possession de moi,&mdash;let me see, what</span><br/>
<span id='184'>then? Saint Denis be my speed!&mdash;donc votre est</span><br/>
<span id='185'>France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much</span><br/>
<span id='187'>more French: I shall never move thee in French,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>unless it be to laugh at me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>Sauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez, il</span><br/>
<span id='190'>est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>No, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of my</span><br/>
<span id='192'>tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs</span><br/>
<span id='193'>be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou</span><br/>
<span id='194'>understand thus much English, canst thou love me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>I cannot tell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll ask</span><br/>
<span id='197'>them. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>when you come into your closet, you'll question this</span><br/>
<span id='199'>gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to</span><br/>
<span id='200'>her dispraise those parts in me that you love with</span><br/>
<span id='201'>your heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the</span><br/>
<span id='202'>rather, gentle princess, because I love thee</span><br/>
<span id='203'>cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a</span><br/>
<span id='204'>saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get</span><br/>
<span id='205'>thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs</span><br/>
<span id='206'>prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a</span><br/>
<span id='208'>boy, half French, half English, that shall go to</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?</span><br/>
<span id='210'>shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair</span><br/>
<span id='211'>flower-de-luce?</span><br/>

<span id='speech37'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='212'>I do not know dat</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='213'>No; 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: do</span><br/>
<span id='214'>but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your</span><br/>
<span id='215'>French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety</span><br/>
<span id='216'>take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer</span><br/>
<span id='217'>you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cher</span><br/>
<span id='218'>et devin deesse?</span><br/>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>

<span id='221'>Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in</span><br/>
<span id='222'>true English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I</span><br/>
<span id='223'>dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to</span><br/>
<span id='224'>flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor</span><br/>
<span id='225'>and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew</span><br/>
<span id='226'>my father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars</span><br/>
<span id='227'>when he got me: therefore was I created with a</span><br/>
<span id='228'>stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when</span><br/>
<span id='229'>I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,</span><br/>
<span id='230'>Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:</span><br/>
<span id='231'>my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of</span><br/>
<span id='232'>beauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thou</span><br/>
<span id='233'>hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou</span><br/>

<span id='235'>and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you</span><br/>
<span id='236'>have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the</span><br/>
<span id='237'>thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;</span><br/>
<span id='238'>take me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England I am</span><br/>
<span id='239'>thine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine</span><br/>
<span id='240'>ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud 'England is</span><br/>
<span id='241'>thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Harry</span><br/>
<span id='242'>Plantagenet is thine;' who though I speak it before</span><br/>
<span id='243'>his face, if he be not fellow with the best king,</span><br/>
<span id='244'>thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.</span><br/>
<span id='245'>Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is</span><br/>
<span id='246'>music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of</span><br/>

<span id='270'>O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear</span><br/>
<span id='271'>Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak</span><br/>
<span id='272'>list of a country's fashion: we are the makers of</span><br/>
<span id='273'>manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our</span><br/>
<span id='274'>places stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will</span><br/>
<span id='275'>do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your</span><br/>
<span id='276'>country in denying me a kiss: therefore, patiently</span><br/>
<span id='277'>and yielding.</span><br/>
<p><em>Kissing her</em></p>
<span id='278'>You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is</span><br/>
<span id='279'>more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the</span><br/>
<span id='280'>tongues of the French council; and they should</span><br/>
<span id='281'>sooner persuade Harry of England than a general</span><br/>
<span id='282'>petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN, BURGUNDY, and other Lords</em></p>

<span id='speech56'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>

<span id='285'>I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how</span><br/>

<span id='speech57'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>

<span id='287'>Is she not apt?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='288'>Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not</span><br/>
<span id='289'>smooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the</span><br/>
<span id='290'>heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up</span><br/>
<span id='291'>the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in</span><br/>
<span id='292'>his true likeness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='293'>Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you</span><br/>

<span id='295'>make a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true</span><br/>
<span id='296'>likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you</span><br/>
<span id='297'>blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the</span><br/>
<span id='298'>virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the</span><br/>
<span id='299'>appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing</span><br/>
<span id='300'>self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid</span><br/>
<span id='301'>to consign to.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>

<span id='302'>Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.</span><br/>

<span id='speech62'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>

<span id='305'>Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='306'>I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will</span><br/>
<span id='307'>teach her to know my meaning: for maids, well</span><br/>
<span id='308'>summered and warm kept, are like flies at</span><br/>
<span id='309'>Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their</span><br/>
<span id='310'>eyes; and then they will endure handling, which</span><br/>
<span id='311'>before would not abide looking on.</span><br/>

<span id='speech65'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>

<span id='315'>As love is, my lord, before it loves.</span><br/>

<span id='speech66'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>

<span id='316'>It is so: and you may, some of you, thank love for</span><br/>
<span id='317'>my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city</span><br/>

<span id='319'>Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities</span><br/>

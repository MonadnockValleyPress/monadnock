<h1>Henry IV, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene II</H3>
<h4>A public road near Coventry.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a</span><br/>
<span id='2'>bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Will you give me money, captain?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Lay out, lay out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>This bottle makes an angel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>An if it do, take it for thy labour; and if it make</span><br/>
<span id='8'>twenty, take them all; I'll answer the coinage. Bid</span><br/>
<span id='9'>my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>I will, captain: farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused</span><br/>
<span id='12'>gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty</span><br/>
<span id='14'>soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me</span><br/>
<span id='15'>none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire</span><br/>
<span id='16'>me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked</span><br/>
<span id='17'>twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as</span><br/>
<span id='19'>fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck</span><br/>
<span id='20'>fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such</span><br/>
<span id='21'>toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no</span><br/>
<span id='22'>bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out</span><br/>
<span id='23'>their services; and now my whole charge consists of</span><br/>
<span id='24'>ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of</span><br/>
<span id='25'>companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the</span><br/>
<span id='26'>painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his</span><br/>
<span id='27'>sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but</span><br/>
<span id='28'>discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to</span><br/>
<span id='29'>younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers</span><br/>
<span id='30'>trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a</span><br/>
<span id='31'>long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than</span><br/>
<span id='32'>an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up</span><br/>
<span id='33'>the rooms of them that have bought out their</span><br/>
<span id='34'>services, that you would think that I had a hundred</span><br/>
<span id='35'>and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from</span><br/>
<span id='36'>swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad</span><br/>
<span id='37'>fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded</span><br/>
<span id='38'>all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye</span><br/>
<span id='39'>hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the</span><br/>
<span id='41'>villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had</span><br/>
<span id='42'>gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of</span><br/>
<span id='43'>prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my</span><br/>
<span id='44'>company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked</span><br/>
<span id='45'>together and thrown over the shoulders like an</span><br/>
<span id='46'>herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say</span><br/>
<span id='47'>the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or</span><br/>
<span id='48'>the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all</span><br/>
<span id='49'>one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the PRINCE and WESTMORELAND</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou</span><br/>
<span id='52'>in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I</span><br/>
<span id='53'>cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been</span><br/>
<span id='54'>at Shrewsbury.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were</span><br/>
<span id='56'>there, and you too; but my powers are there already.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must</span><br/>
<span id='58'>away all night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to</span><br/>
<span id='60'>steal cream.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath</span><br/>
<span id='62'>already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose</span><br/>
<span id='63'>fellows are these that come after?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Mine, Hal, mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>I did never see such pitiful rascals.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Tut, tut; good enough to toss; food for powder, food</span><br/>
<span id='67'>for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor</span><br/>
<span id='70'>and bare, too beggarly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had</span><br/>
<span id='72'>that; and for their bareness, I am sure they never</span><br/>
<span id='73'>learned that of me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>No I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on</span><br/>
<span id='75'>the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is</span><br/>
<span id='76'>already in the field.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>What, is the king encamped?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Well,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

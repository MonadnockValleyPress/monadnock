<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</H3>
<h4>The same.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LORD BARDOLPH</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Who keeps the gate here, ho?</span><br/>
<p><em>The Porter opens the gate</em></p>
<span id='2'>Where is the earl?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Porter</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>What shall I say you are?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Tell thou the earl</span><br/>
<span id='5'>That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Porter</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Please it your honour, knock but at the gate,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And he himself wilt answer.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter NORTHUMBERLAND</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Here comes the earl.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Porter</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Should be the father of some stratagem:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The times are wild: contention, like a horse</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And bears down all before him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Noble earl,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Good, an God will!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>                  As good as heart can wish:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>The king is almost wounded to the death;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And, in the fortune of my lord your son,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Came not till now to dignify the times,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Since Caesar's fortunes!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>How is this derived?</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>A gentleman well bred and of good name,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>That freely render'd me these news for true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent</span><br/>
<span id='35'>On Tuesday last to listen after news.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter TRAVERS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>My lord, I over-rode him on the way;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And he is furnish'd with no certainties</span><br/>
<span id='38'>More than he haply may retail from me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TRAVERS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back</span><br/>
<span id='41'>With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard</span><br/>
<span id='43'>A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him</span><br/>
<span id='46'>I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>He told me that rebellion had bad luck</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>With that, he gave his able horse the head,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And bending forward struck his armed heels</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Against the panting sides of his poor jade</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Up to the rowel-head, and starting so</span><br/>
<span id='53'>He seem'd in running to devour the way,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Staying no longer question.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Ha! Again:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Had met ill luck?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>                  My lord, I'll tell you what;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>If my young lord your son have not the day,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Upon mine honour, for a silken point</span><br/>
<span id='62'>I'll give my barony: never talk of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Give then such instances of loss?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Who, he?</span><br/>
<span id='66'>He was some hilding fellow that had stolen</span><br/>
<span id='67'>The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MORTON</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Hath left a witness'd usurpation.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MORTON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask</span><br/>
<span id='76'>To fright our party.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>How doth my son and brother?</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>MORTON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>But, for my lord your son&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Why, he is dead.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!</span><br/>
<span id='96'>He that but fears the thing he would not know</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes</span><br/>
<span id='98'>That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Tell thou an earl his divination lies,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And I will take it as a sweet disgrace</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MORTON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>You are too great to be by me gainsaid:</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>I see a strange confession in thine eye:</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin</span><br/>
<span id='107'>To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>The tongue offends not that reports his death:</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Not he which says the dead is not alive.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Hath but a losing office, and his tongue</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Remember'd tolling a departing friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>MORTON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I am sorry I should force you to believe</span><br/>
<span id='117'>That which I would to God I had not seen;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down</span><br/>
<span id='121'>The never-daunted Percy to the earth,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>From whence with life he never more sprung up.</span><br/>
<span id='123'>In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Being bruited once, took fire and heat away</span><br/>
<span id='126'>From the best temper'd courage in his troops;</span><br/>
<span id='127'>For from his metal was his party steel'd;</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Which once in him abated, all the rest</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And as the thing that's heavy in itself,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear</span><br/>
<span id='134'>That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Had three times slain the appearance of the king,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out</span><br/>
<span id='144'>A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Under the conduct of young Lancaster</span><br/>
<span id='146'>And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>For this I shall have time enough to mourn.</span><br/>
<span id='148'>In poison there is physic; and these news,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Having been well, that would have made me sick,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Being sick, have in some measure made me well:</span><br/>
<span id='151'>And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!</span><br/>
<span id='157'>A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Thou art a guard too wanton for the head</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Now bind my brows with iron; and approach</span><br/>
<span id='162'>The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring</span><br/>
<span id='163'>To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And let this world no longer be a stage</span><br/>
<span id='167'>To feed contention in a lingering act;</span><br/>
<span id='168'>But let one spirit of the first-born Cain</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set</span><br/>
<span id='170'>On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>And darkness be the burier of the dead!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>TRAVERS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>MORTON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>The lives of all your loving complices</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er</span><br/>
<span id='176'>To stormy passion, must perforce decay.</span><br/>
<span id='177'>You cast the event of war, my noble lord,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>And summ'd the account of chance, before you said</span><br/>
<span id='179'>'Let us make head.' It was your presurmise,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:</span><br/>
<span id='181'>You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>More likely to fall in than to get o'er;</span><br/>
<span id='183'>You were advised his flesh was capable</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Though strongly apprehended, could restrain</span><br/>
<span id='188'>The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>More than that being which was like to be?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>We all that are engaged to this loss</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas</span><br/>
<span id='193'>That if we wrought our life 'twas ten to one;</span><br/>
<span id='194'>And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Choked the respect of likely peril fear'd;</span><br/>
<span id='196'>And since we are o'erset, venture again.</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>MORTON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>'Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>The gentle Archbishop of York is up</span><br/>
<span id='201'>With well-appointed powers: he is a man</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Who with a double surety binds his followers.</span><br/>
<span id='203'>My lord your son had only but the corpse,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;</span><br/>
<span id='205'>For that same word, rebellion, did divide</span><br/>
<span id='206'>The action of their bodies from their souls;</span><br/>
<span id='207'>And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>As men drink potions, that their weapons only</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Seem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Turns insurrection to religion:</span><br/>
<span id='213'>Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>He's followed both with body and with mind;</span><br/>
<span id='215'>And doth enlarge his rising with the blood</span><br/>
<span id='216'>Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;</span><br/>
<span id='217'>Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;</span><br/>
<span id='218'>Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;</span><br/>
<span id='220'>And more and less do flock to follow him.</span><br/>

<span id='222'>This present grief had wiped it from my mind.</span><br/>
<span id='223'>Go in with me; and counsel every man</span><br/>
<span id='224'>The aptest way for safety and revenge:</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Never so few, and never yet more need.</span><br/>

<h1>Richard III</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>London. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GLOUCESTER, solus</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now is the winter of our discontent</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Made glorious summer by this sun of York;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house</span><br/>
<span id='4'>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber</span><br/>
<span id='13'>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty</span><br/>
<span id='17'>To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And that so lamely and unfashionable</span><br/>
<span id='23'>That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Have no delight to pass away the time,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Unless to spy my shadow in the sun</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And descant on mine own deformity:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>I am determined to prove a villain</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>To set my brother Clarence and the king</span><br/>
<span id='35'>In deadly hate the one against the other:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And if King Edward be as true and just</span><br/>
<span id='37'>As I am subtle, false and treacherous,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>About a prophecy, which says that 'G'</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Clarence comes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY</em></p>
<span id='43'>Brother, good day; what means this armed guard</span><br/>
<span id='44'>That waits upon your grace?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>His majesty</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed</span><br/>
<span id='47'>This conduct to convey me to the Tower.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Upon what cause?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>                  Because my name is George.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>He should, for that, commit your godfathers:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>O, belike his majesty hath some intent</span><br/>
<span id='53'>That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest</span><br/>
<span id='56'>As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And says a wizard told him that by G</span><br/>
<span id='60'>His issue disinherited should be;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And, for my name of George begins with G,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>It follows in his thought that I am he.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>These, as I learn, and such like toys as these</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Have moved his highness to commit me now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she</span><br/>
<span id='68'>That tempers him to this extremity.</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Was it not she and that good man of worship,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Anthony Woodville, her brother there,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>From whence this present day he is deliver'd?</span><br/>
<span id='73'>We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>By heaven, I think there's no man is secure</span><br/>
<span id='75'>But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds</span><br/>
<span id='76'>That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Heard ye not what an humble suppliant</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Humbly complaining to her deity</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>If we will keep in favour with the king,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>To be her men and wear her livery:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BRAKENBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>I beseech your graces both to pardon me;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>His majesty hath straitly given in charge</span><br/>
<span id='89'>That no man shall have private conference,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Of what degree soever, with his brother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>You may partake of any thing we say:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>We speak no treason, man: we say the king</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>How say you sir? Can you deny all this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BRAKENBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>He that doth naught with her, excepting one,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Were best he do it secretly, alone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BRAKENBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>What one, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BRAKENBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Forbear your conference with the noble duke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And whatsoever you will employ me in,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>I will perform it to enfranchise you.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Touches me deeper than you can imagine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I know it pleaseth neither of us well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Meantime, have patience.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>I must perforce. Farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>If heaven will take the present at our hands.</span><br/>
<span id='124'>But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HASTINGS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Good time of day unto my gracious lord!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>As much unto my good lord chamberlain!</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Well are you welcome to the open air.</span><br/>
<span id='128'>How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks</span><br/>
<span id='131'>That were the cause of my imprisonment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>For they that were your enemies are his,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And have prevail'd as much on him as you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>What news abroad?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>No news so bad abroad as this at home;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>And his physicians fear him mightily.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.</span><br/>
<span id='142'>O, he hath kept an evil diet long,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>And overmuch consumed his royal person:</span><br/>
<span id='144'>'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.</span><br/>
<span id='145'>What, is he in his bed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>He is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Go you before, and I will follow you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit HASTINGS</em></p>
<span id='148'>He cannot live, I hope; and must not die</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.</span><br/>
<span id='150'>I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>And, if I fall not in my deep intent,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Clarence hath not another day to live:</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>And leave the world for me to bustle in!</span><br/>
<span id='156'>For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.</span><br/>
<span id='157'>What though I kill'd her husband and her father?</span><br/>
<span id='158'>The readiest way to make the wench amends</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Is to become her husband and her father:</span><br/>
<span id='160'>The which will I; not all so much for love</span><br/>
<span id='161'>As for another secret close intent,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>By marrying her which I must reach unto.</span><br/>
<span id='163'>But yet I run before my horse to market:</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:</span><br/>
<span id='165'>When they are gone, then must I count my gains.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

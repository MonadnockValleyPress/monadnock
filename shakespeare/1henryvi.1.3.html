<h4>London. Before the Tower.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GLOUCESTER, with his Serving-men in blue coats</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I am come to survey the Tower this day:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Since Henry's death, I fear, there is conveyance.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Where be these warders, that they wait not here?</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that calls.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Warder</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>[Within]  Who's there that knocks so imperiously?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>First Serving-Man</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>It is the noble Duke of Gloucester.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Warder</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>[Within]  Whoe'er he be, you may not be let in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Serving-Man</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Villains, answer you so the lord protector?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>First Warder</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>[Within]  The Lord protect him! so we answer him:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>We do no otherwise than we are will'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Who willed you? or whose will stands but mine?</span><br/>
<span id='12'>There's none protector of the realm but I.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?</span><br/>
<p><em>Gloucester's men rush at the Tower Gates, and WOODVILE the Lieutenant speaks within</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>WOODVILE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>What noise is this? what traitors have we here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Open the gates; here's Gloucester that would enter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>WOODVILE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Have patience, noble duke; I may not open;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>The Cardinal of Winchester forbids:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>From him I have express commandment</span><br/>
<span id='21'>That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Faint-hearted Woodvile, prizest him 'fore me?</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook?</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Thou art no friend to God or to the king:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Serving-Men</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Open the gates unto the lord protector,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Or we'll burst them open, if that you come not quickly.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter to the Protector at the Tower Gates BISHOP OF WINCHESTER and his men in tawny coats</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>How now, ambitious Humphry! what means this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Peel'd priest, dost thou command me to be shut out?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>I do, thou most usurping proditor,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And not protector, of the king or realm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Thou that contrivedst to murder our dead lord;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Thou that givest whores indulgences to sin:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>If thou proceed in this thy insolence.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>BISHOP</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Nay, stand thou back, I will not budge a foot:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>This be Damascus, be thou cursed Cain,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth</span><br/>
<span id='44'>I'll use to carry thee out of this place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Do what thou darest; I beard thee to thy face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>What! am I dared and bearded to my face?</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Draw, men, for all this privileged place;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Blue coats to tawny coats. Priest, beware your beard,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly:</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>In spite of pope or dignities of church,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the pope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Winchester goose, I cry, a rope! a rope!</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Out, tawny coats! out, scarlet hypocrite!</span><br/>
<p><em>Here GLOUCESTER's men beat out BISHOP OF WINCHESTER's men, and enter in the hurly-burly the Mayor of London and his Officers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Mayor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Fie, lords! that you, being supreme magistrates,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Thus contumeliously should break the peace!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Peace, mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor king,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>One that still motions war and never peace,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>O'ercharging your free purses with large fines,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>That seeks to overthrow religion,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Because he is protector of the realm,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And would have armour here out of the Tower,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>To crown himself king and suppress the prince.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>I will not answer thee with words, but blows.</span><br/>
<p><em>Here they skirmish again</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Mayor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife</span><br/>
<span id='72'>But to make open proclamation:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Come, officer; as loud as e'er thou canst,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Cry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>All manner of men assembled here in arms this day</span><br/>
<span id='76'>against God's peace and the king's, we charge and</span><br/>
<span id='77'>command you, in his highness' name, to repair to</span><br/>
<span id='78'>your several dwelling-places; and not to wear,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>handle, or use any sword, weapon, or dagger,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>henceforward, upon pain of death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Cardinal, I'll be no breaker of the law:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>But we shall meet, and break our minds at large.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Gloucester, we will meet; to thy cost, be sure:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>Mayor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>I'll call for clubs, if you will not away.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>This cardinal's more haughty than the devil.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Mayor, farewell: thou dost but what thou mayst.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Abominable Gloucester, guard thy head;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>For I intend to have it ere long.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt, severally, GLOUCESTER and BISHOP OF WINCHESTER with their Serving-men</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>Mayor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!</span><br/>
<span id='92'>I myself fight not once in forty year.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

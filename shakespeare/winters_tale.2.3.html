<h1>Winter's Tale</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene III</h3>
<h4>A room in Leontes' palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LEONTES, ANTIGONUS, Lords, and Servants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness</span><br/>
<span id='2'>To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If</span><br/>
<span id='3'>The cause were not in being,&mdash;part o' the cause,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>She the adulteress; for the harlot king</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she</span><br/>
<span id='7'>I can hook to me: say that she were gone,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Might come to me again. Who's there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>My lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>How does the boy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>                  He took good rest to-night;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>To see his nobleness!</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>See how he fares.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Servant</em></p>
<span id='21'>Fie, fie! no thought of him:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>The thought of my revenges that way</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And in his parties, his alliance; let him be</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Shall she within my power.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PAULINA, with a child</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>You must not enter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>More free than he is jealous.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>That's enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Second Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded</span><br/>
<span id='37'>None should come at him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Not so hot, good sir:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>That creep like shadows by him and do sigh</span><br/>
<span id='41'>At each his needless heavings, such as you</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Nourish the cause of his awaking: I</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Do come with words as medicinal as true,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Honest as either, to purge him of that humour</span><br/>
<span id='45'>That presses him from sleep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>What noise there, ho?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>No noise, my lord; but needful conference</span><br/>
<span id='48'>About some gossips for your highness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>How!</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>I charged thee that she should not come about me:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>I knew she would.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>                  I told her so, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>On your displeasure's peril and on mine,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>She should not visit you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>What, canst not rule her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>From all dishonesty he can: in this,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Unless he take the course that you have done,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Commit me for committing honour, trust it,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>He shall not rule me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>La you now, you hear:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>When she will take the rein I let her run;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>But she'll not stumble.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Good my liege, I come;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Myself your loyal servant, your physician,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Less appear so in comforting your evils,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come</span><br/>
<span id='70'>From your good queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Good queen!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Good queen, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Good queen; I say good queen;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And would by combat make her good, so were I</span><br/>
<span id='75'>A man, the worst about you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Force her hence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes</span><br/>
<span id='78'>First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.</span><br/>
<p><em>Laying down the child</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Out!</span><br/>
<span id='83'>A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>A most intelligencing bawd!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Not so:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>I am as ignorant in that as you</span><br/>
<span id='87'>In so entitling me, and no less honest</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>As this world goes, to pass for honest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Traitors!</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted</span><br/>
<span id='93'>By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>For ever</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Takest up the princess by that forced baseness</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Which he has put upon't!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>He dreads his wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt</span><br/>
<span id='101'>You'ld call your children yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>A nest of traitors!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>I am none, by this good light.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Nor I, nor any</span><br/>
<span id='105'>But one that's here, and that's himself, for he</span><br/>
<span id='106'>The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>and will not&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='110'>For, as the case now stands, it is a curse</span><br/>
<span id='111'>He cannot be compell'd to't&mdash;once remove</span><br/>
<span id='112'>The root of his opinion, which is rotten</span><br/>
<span id='113'>As ever oak or stone was sound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>A callat</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>It is the issue of Polixenes:</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Hence with it, and together with the dam</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Commit them to the fire!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>It is yours;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Although the print be little, the whole matter</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>His smiles,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it</span><br/>
<span id='130'>So like to him that got it, if thou hast</span><br/>
<span id='131'>The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours</span><br/>
<span id='132'>No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Her children not her husband's!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>A gross hag</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>That wilt not stay her tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Hang all the husbands</span><br/>
<span id='138'>That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Hardly one subject.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Once more, take her hence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>A most unworthy and unnatural lord</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Can do no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>                  I'll ha' thee burnt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>I care not:</span><br/>
<span id='145'>It is an heretic that makes the fire,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;</span><br/>
<span id='147'>But this most cruel usage of your queen,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Not able to produce more accusation</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Yea, scandalous to the world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>On your allegiance,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Where were her life? she durst not call me so,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>If she did know me one. Away with her!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Jove send her</span><br/>
<span id='159'>A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?</span><br/>
<span id='160'>You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Will never do him good, not one of you.</span><br/>
<span id='162'>So, so: farewell; we are gone.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.</span><br/>
<span id='164'>My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast</span><br/>
<span id='165'>A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And see it instantly consumed with fire;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse</span><br/>
<span id='171'>And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>The bastard brains with these my proper hands</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>For thou set'st on thy wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>I did not, sir:</span><br/>
<span id='176'>These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Can clear me in't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Lords</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>                  We can: my royal liege,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>He is not guilty of her coming hither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>You're liars all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>Beseech your highness, give us better credit:</span><br/>
<span id='182'>We have always truly served you, and beseech you</span><br/>
<span id='183'>So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>As recompense of our dear services</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Which being so horrible, so bloody, must</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>I am a feather for each wind that blows:</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel</span><br/>
<span id='190'>And call me father? better burn it now</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.</span><br/>
<span id='192'>It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;</span><br/>
<span id='193'>You that have been so tenderly officious</span><br/>
<span id='194'>With Lady Margery, your midwife there,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>To save this bastard's life,&mdash;for 'tis a bastard,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>So sure as this beard's grey,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>&mdash;what will you adventure</span><br/>
<span id='198'>To save this brat's life?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>Any thing, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>That my ability may undergo</span><br/>
<span id='201'>And nobleness impose: at least thus much:</span><br/>
<span id='202'>I'll pawn the little blood which I have left</span><br/>
<span id='203'>To save the innocent: any thing possible.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>It shall be possible. Swear by this sword</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Thou wilt perform my bidding.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>I will, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='207'>Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Of any point in't shall not only be</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry</span><br/>
<span id='212'>This female bastard hence and that thou bear it</span><br/>
<span id='213'>To some remote and desert place quite out</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Without more mercy, to its own protection</span><br/>
<span id='216'>And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune</span><br/>
<span id='217'>It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,</span><br/>
<span id='218'>On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>That thou commend it strangely to some place</span><br/>
<span id='220'>Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>I swear to do this, though a present death</span><br/>
<span id='222'>Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:</span><br/>
<span id='223'>Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens</span><br/>
<span id='224'>To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Casting their savageness aside have done</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous</span><br/>
<span id='227'>In more than this deed does require! And blessing</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Against this cruelty fight on thy side,</span><br/>
<span id='229'>Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit with the child</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='230'>No, I'll not rear</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Another's issue.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Servant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='232'>                  Please your highness, posts</span><br/>
<span id='233'>From those you sent to the oracle are come</span><br/>

<span id='235'>Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>

<span id='239'>Twenty-three days</span><br/>
<span id='240'>They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells</span><br/>

<span id='243'>Summon a session, that we may arraign</span><br/>
<span id='244'>Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath</span><br/>
<span id='245'>Been publicly accused, so shall she have</span><br/>
<span id='246'>A just and open trial. While she lives</span><br/>
<span id='247'>My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,</span><br/>
<span id='248'>And think upon my bidding.</span><br/>

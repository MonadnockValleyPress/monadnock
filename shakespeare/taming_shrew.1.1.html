<h1>Taming of the Shrew</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Padua. A public place.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Tranio, since for the great desire I had</span><br/>
<span id='2'>To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>The pleasant garden of great Italy;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And by my father's love and leave am arm'd</span><br/>
<span id='6'>With his good will and thy good company,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>My trusty servant, well approved in all,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Here let us breathe and haply institute</span><br/>
<span id='9'>A course of learning and ingenious studies.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Pisa renown'd for grave citizens</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Gave me my being and my father first,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>A merchant of great traffic through the world,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Vincetino come of Bentivolii.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Vincetino's son brought up in Florence</span><br/>
<span id='15'>It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Virtue and that part of philosophy</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Will I apply that treats of happiness</span><br/>
<span id='20'>By virtue specially to be achieved.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And am to Padua come, as he that leaves</span><br/>
<span id='23'>A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>I am in all affected as yourself;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Glad that you thus continue your resolve</span><br/>
<span id='28'>To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Only, good master, while we do admire</span><br/>
<span id='30'>This virtue and this moral discipline,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques</span><br/>
<span id='33'>As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Balk logic with acquaintance that you have</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And practise rhetoric in your common talk;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Music and poesy use to quicken you;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>The mathematics and the metaphysics,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>In brief, sir, study what you most affect.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.</span><br/>
<span id='42'>If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>We could at once put us in readiness,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And take a lodging fit to entertain</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>But stay a while: what company is this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Master, some show to welcome us to town.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BAPTISTA, KATHARINA, BIANCA, GREMIO, and HORTENSIO. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Gentlemen, importune me no farther,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>For how I firmly am resolved you know;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>That is, not bestow my youngest daughter</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Before I have a husband for the elder:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>If either of you both love Katharina,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Because I know you well and love you well,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>[Aside]  To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>I pray you, sir, is it your will</span><br/>
<span id='58'>To make a stale of me amongst these mates?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>I wis it is not half way to her heart;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>But if it were, doubt not her care should be</span><br/>
<span id='64'>To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And paint your face and use you like a fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HORTENSIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>And me too, good Lord!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>But in the other's silence do I see</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Maid's mild behavior and sobriety.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Peace, Tranio!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Gentlemen, that I may soon make good</span><br/>
<span id='75'>What I have said, Bianca, get you in:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>A pretty peat! it is best</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Sister, content you in my discontent.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>My books and instruments shall be my company,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>On them to took and practise by myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Sorry am I that our good will effects</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Bianca's grief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>                  Why will you mew her up,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And make her bear the penance of her tongue?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Go in, Bianca.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit BIANCA</em></p>
<span id='93'>And for I know she taketh most delight</span><br/>
<span id='94'>In music, instruments and poetry,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Prefer them hither; for to cunning men</span><br/>
<span id='99'>I will be very kind, and liberal</span><br/>
<span id='100'>To mine own children in good bringing up:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>For I have more to commune with Bianca.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, I</span><br/>
<span id='105'>knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so</span><br/>
<span id='107'>good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not</span><br/>
<span id='108'>so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails</span><br/>
<span id='109'>together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on</span><br/>
<span id='110'>both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my</span><br/>
<span id='111'>sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit</span><br/>
<span id='112'>man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will</span><br/>
<span id='113'>wish him to her father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked</span><br/>
<span id='116'>parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>that we may yet again have access to our fair</span><br/>
<span id='118'>mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca's love, to</span><br/>
<span id='119'>labour and effect one thing specially.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>What's that, I pray?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>A husband! a devil.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>I say, a husband.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though</span><br/>
<span id='125'>her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool</span><br/>
<span id='126'>to be married to hell?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine</span><br/>
<span id='128'>to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good</span><br/>
<span id='129'>fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>would take her with all faults, and money enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with</span><br/>
<span id='132'>this condition, to be whipped at the high cross</span><br/>
<span id='133'>every morning.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten</span><br/>
<span id='135'>apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us</span><br/>
<span id='136'>friends, it shall be so far forth friendly</span><br/>
<span id='137'>maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter</span><br/>
<span id='138'>to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man</span><br/>
<span id='140'>be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.</span><br/>
<span id='141'>How say you, Signior Gremio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>I am agreed; and would I had given him the best</span><br/>
<span id='143'>horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would</span><br/>
<span id='144'>thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the</span><br/>
<span id='145'>house of her! Come on.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible</span><br/>
<span id='147'>That love should of a sudden take such hold?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>O Tranio, till I found it to be true,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>I never thought it possible or likely;</span><br/>
<span id='150'>But see, while idly I stood looking on,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>I found the effect of love in idleness:</span><br/>
<span id='152'>And now in plainness do confess to thee,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>That art to me as secret and as dear</span><br/>
<span id='154'>As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>If I achieve not this young modest girl.</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Master, it is no time to chide you now;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Affection is not rated from the heart:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:</span><br/>
<span id='164'>The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Such as the daughter of Agenor had,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.</span><br/>
<span id='170'>When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Began to scold and raise up such a storm</span><br/>
<span id='173'>That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move</span><br/>
<span id='175'>And with her breath she did perfume the air:</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.</span><br/>
<span id='178'>I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd</span><br/>
<span id='181'>That till the father rid his hands of her,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Master, your love must live a maid at home;</span><br/>
<span id='183'>And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!</span><br/>
<span id='186'>But art thou not advised, he took some care</span><br/>
<span id='187'>To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>I have it, Tranio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>                  Master, for my hand,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Both our inventions meet and jump in one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Tell me thine first.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>You will be schoolmaster</span><br/>
<span id='194'>And undertake the teaching of the maid:</span><br/>
<span id='195'>That's your device.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>It is: may it be done?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>Not possible; for who shall bear your part,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Visit his countrymen and banquet them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>Basta; content thee, for I have it full.</span><br/>
<span id='202'>We have not yet been seen in any house,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces</span><br/>
<span id='204'>For man or master; then it follows thus;</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Keep house and port and servants as I should:</span><br/>
<span id='207'>I will some other be, some Florentine,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.</span><br/>
<span id='209'>'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:</span><br/>
<span id='211'>When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;</span><br/>
<span id='212'>But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='213'>So had you need.</span><br/>
<span id='214'>In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>And I am tied to be obedient;</span><br/>
<span id='216'>For so your father charged me at our parting,</span><br/>
<span id='217'>'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,</span><br/>
<span id='218'>Although I think 'twas in another sense;</span><br/>
<span id='219'>I am content to be Lucentio,</span><br/>
<span id='220'>Because so well I love Lucentio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:</span><br/>
<span id='222'>And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid</span><br/>
<span id='223'>Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.</span><br/>
<span id='224'>Here comes the rogue.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BIONDELLO</em></p>
<span id='225'>Sirrah, where have you been?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='226'>Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?</span><br/>
<span id='227'>Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or</span><br/>
<span id='228'>you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='229'>Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,</span><br/>
<span id='230'>And therefore frame your manners to the time.</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,</span><br/>
<span id='232'>Puts my apparel and my countenance on,</span><br/>
<span id='233'>And I for my escape have put on his;</span><br/>
<span id='234'>For in a quarrel since I came ashore</span><br/>
<span id='235'>I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:</span><br/>
<span id='236'>Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,</span><br/>
<span id='237'>While I make way from hence to save my life:</span><br/>
<span id='238'>You understand me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='239'>                  I, sir! ne'er a whit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='240'>And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:</span><br/>
<span id='241'>Tranio is changed into Lucentio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='242'>The better for him: would I were so too!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='243'>So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,</span><br/>
<span id='244'>That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.</span><br/>
<span id='245'>But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise</span><br/>
<span id='246'>You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:</span><br/>

<span id='248'>But in all places else your master Lucentio.</span><br/>

<span id='speech60'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>

<span id='249'>Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that</span><br/>
<span id='250'>thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if</span><br/>
<span id='251'>thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good</span><br/>

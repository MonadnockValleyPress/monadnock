<h1>Much Ado About Nothing</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Leonato's orchard.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter BENEDICK</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Boy!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Boy</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Boy</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Signior?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither</span><br/>
<span id='4'>to me in the orchard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Boy</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>I am here already, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Boy</em></p>
<span id='7'>I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much</span><br/>
<span id='8'>another man is a fool when he dedicates his</span><br/>
<span id='9'>behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at</span><br/>
<span id='10'>such shallow follies in others, become the argument</span><br/>
<span id='11'>of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man</span><br/>
<span id='12'>is Claudio. I have known when there was no music</span><br/>
<span id='13'>with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he</span><br/>
<span id='14'>rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known</span><br/>
<span id='15'>when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a</span><br/>
<span id='16'>good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to</span><br/>
<span id='18'>speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man</span><br/>
<span id='19'>and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his</span><br/>
<span id='20'>words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many</span><br/>
<span id='21'>strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with</span><br/>
<span id='22'>these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not</span><br/>
<span id='23'>be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster</span><br/>
<span id='25'>of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman</span><br/>
<span id='26'>is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am</span><br/>
<span id='27'>well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all</span><br/>
<span id='28'>graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in</span><br/>
<span id='29'>my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>fair, or I'll   never look on her; mild, or come not</span><br/>
<span id='32'>near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good</span><br/>
<span id='33'>discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall</span><br/>
<span id='34'>be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.</span><br/>
<p><em>Withdraws</em></p>
<p><em>Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Come, shall we hear this music?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>See you where Benedick hath hid himself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>O, very well, my lord: the music ended,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BALTHASAR with Music</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BALTHASAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice</span><br/>
<span id='44'>To slander music any more than once.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>It is the witness still of excellency</span><br/>
<span id='46'>To put a strange face on his own perfection.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BALTHASAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Since many a wooer doth commence his suit</span><br/>
<span id='50'>To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Yet will he swear he loves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Now, pray thee, come;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Do it in notes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BALTHASAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>                  Note this before my notes;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.</span><br/>
<p><em>Air</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it</span><br/>
<span id='60'>not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out</span><br/>
<span id='61'>of men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when</span><br/>
<span id='62'>all's done.</span><br/>
<p><em>The Song</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BALTHASAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>     Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Men were deceivers ever,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>One foot in sea and one on shore,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>To one thing constant never:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Then sigh not so, but let them go,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And be you blithe and bonny,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Converting all your sounds of woe</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Into Hey nonny, nonny.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Of dumps so dull and heavy;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>The fraud of men was ever so,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Since summer first was leafy:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Then sigh not so,  &amp;c.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>By my troth, a good song.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BALTHASAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>And an ill singer, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>they would have hanged him: and I pray God his bad</span><br/>
<span id='81'>voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the</span><br/>
<span id='82'>night-raven, come what plague could have come after</span><br/>
<span id='83'>it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night we</span><br/>
<span id='86'>would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BALTHASAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>The best I can, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Do so: farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit BALTHASAR</em></p>
<span id='89'>Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of</span><br/>
<span id='90'>to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Signior Benedick?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>O, ay: stalk on, stalk on; the fowl sits. I did</span><br/>
<span id='93'>never think that lady would have loved any man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she</span><br/>
<span id='95'>should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in</span><br/>
<span id='96'>all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think</span><br/>
<span id='99'>of it but that she loves him with an enraged</span><br/>
<span id='100'>affection: it is past the infinite of thought.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>May be she doth but counterfeit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Faith, like enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of</span><br/>
<span id='104'>passion came so near the life of passion as she</span><br/>
<span id='105'>discovers it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Why, what effects of passion shows she?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard</span><br/>
<span id='109'>my daughter tell you how.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>She did, indeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I</span><br/>
<span id='112'>thought her spirit had been invincible against all</span><br/>
<span id='113'>assaults of affection.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially</span><br/>
<span id='115'>against Benedick.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I should think this a gull, but that the</span><br/>
<span id='117'>white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>sure, hide himself in such reverence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall</span><br/>
<span id='123'>I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him</span><br/>
<span id='124'>with scorn, write to him that I love him?'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>This says she now when she is beginning to write to</span><br/>
<span id='126'>him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and</span><br/>
<span id='127'>there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a</span><br/>
<span id='128'>sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a</span><br/>
<span id='130'>pretty jest your daughter told us of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she</span><br/>
<span id='132'>found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>That.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;</span><br/>
<span id='135'>railed at herself, that she should be so immodest</span><br/>
<span id='136'>to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I</span><br/>
<span id='137'>measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I</span><br/>
<span id='138'>should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I</span><br/>
<span id='139'>love him, I should.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O</span><br/>
<span id='142'>sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the</span><br/>
<span id='144'>ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter</span><br/>
<span id='145'>is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage</span><br/>
<span id='146'>to herself: it is very true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>It were good that Benedick knew of it by some</span><br/>
<span id='148'>other, if she will not discover it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>To what end? He would make but a sport of it and</span><br/>
<span id='150'>torment the poor lady worse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an</span><br/>
<span id='152'>excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>she is virtuous.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>And she is exceeding wise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>In every thing but in loving Benedick.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender</span><br/>
<span id='157'>a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath</span><br/>
<span id='158'>the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just</span><br/>
<span id='159'>cause, being her uncle and her guardian.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would</span><br/>
<span id='161'>have daffed all other respects and made her half</span><br/>
<span id='162'>myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear</span><br/>
<span id='163'>what a' will say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Were it good, think you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she</span><br/>
<span id='166'>will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere</span><br/>
<span id='167'>she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo</span><br/>
<span id='168'>her, rather than she will bate one breath of her</span><br/>
<span id='169'>accustomed crossness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>She doth well: if she should make tender of her</span><br/>
<span id='171'>love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the</span><br/>
<span id='172'>man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>He is a very proper man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>He hath indeed a good outward happiness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>And I take him to be valiant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of</span><br/>
<span id='179'>quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he</span><br/>
<span id='180'>avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes</span><br/>
<span id='181'>them with a most Christian-like fear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:</span><br/>
<span id='183'>if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a</span><br/>
<span id='184'>quarrel with fear and trembling.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests</span><br/>
<span id='187'>he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall</span><br/>
<span id='188'>we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with</span><br/>
<span id='190'>good counsel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:</span><br/>
<span id='193'>let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I</span><br/>
<span id='194'>could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see</span><br/>
<span id='195'>how much he is unworthy so good a lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never</span><br/>
<span id='198'>trust my expectation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>Let there be the same net spread for her; and that</span><br/>
<span id='200'>must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The</span><br/>
<span id='201'>sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of</span><br/>
<span id='202'>another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the</span><br/>
<span id='203'>scene that I would see, which will be merely a</span><br/>
<span id='204'>dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>[Coming forward]  This can be no trick: the</span><br/>
<span id='206'>conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of</span><br/>
<span id='207'>this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it</span><br/>
<span id='208'>seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!</span><br/>
<span id='209'>why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:</span><br/>
<span id='210'>they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive</span><br/>
<span id='211'>the love come from her; they say too that she will</span><br/>
<span id='212'>rather die than give any sign of affection. I did</span><br/>
<span id='213'>never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy</span><br/>
<span id='214'>are they that hear their detractions and can put</span><br/>
<span id='215'>them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a</span><br/>
<span id='216'>truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis</span><br/>
<span id='217'>so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving</span><br/>
<span id='218'>me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor</span><br/>
<span id='219'>no great argument of her folly, for I will be</span><br/>
<span id='220'>horribly in love with her. I may chance have some</span><br/>
<span id='221'>odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,</span><br/>
<span id='222'>because I have railed so long against marriage: but</span><br/>
<span id='223'>doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat</span><br/>
<span id='224'>in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of</span><br/>
<span id='226'>the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?</span><br/>
<span id='227'>No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would</span><br/>
<span id='228'>die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I</span><br/>
<span id='229'>were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!</span><br/>
<span id='230'>she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in</span><br/>
<span id='231'>her.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BEATRICE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='232'>Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='233'>Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='234'>I took no more pains for those thanks than you take</span><br/>
<span id='235'>pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would</span><br/>
<span id='236'>not have come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='237'>You take pleasure then in the message?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='241'>Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in</span><br/>
<span id='242'>to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took</span><br/>
<span id='243'>no more pains for those thanks than you took pains</span><br/>
<span id='244'>to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains</span><br/>
<span id='245'>that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do</span><br/>
<span id='246'>not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not</span><br/>
<span id='247'>love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

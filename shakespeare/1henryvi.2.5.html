<h4>The Tower of London.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter MORTIMER, brought in a chair, and Gaolers</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Even like a man new haled from the rack,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Nestor-like aged in an age of care,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine</span><br/>
<span id='12'>That droops his sapless branches to the ground;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Unable to support this lump of clay,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>As witting I no other comfort have.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Gaoler</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And answer was return'd that he will come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Before whose glory I was great in arms,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>This loathsome sequestration have I had:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And even since then hath Richard been obscured,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Deprived of honour and inheritance.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>But now the arbitrator of despairs,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>I would his troubles likewise were expired,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>That so he might recover what was lost.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Gaoler</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>My lord, your loving nephew now is come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And in his bosom spend my latter gasp:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>This day, in argument upon a case,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Among which terms he used his lavish tongue</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And did upbraid me with my father's death:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Else with the like I had requited him.</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>In honour of a true Plantagenet</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And for alliance sake, declare the cause</span><br/>
<span id='54'>My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Was cursed instrument of his decease.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Discover more at large what cause that was,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>For I am ignorant and cannot guess.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>I will, if that my fading breath permit</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And death approach not ere my tale be done.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>The first-begotten and the lawful heir,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Of Edward king, the third of that descent:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>During whose reign the Percies of the north,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Finding his usurpation most unjust,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>The reason moved these warlike lords to this</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Was, for that&mdash;young King Richard thus removed,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Leaving no heir begotten of his body&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>I was the next by birth and parentage;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>For by my mother I derived am</span><br/>
<span id='75'>From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son</span><br/>
<span id='76'>To King Edward the Third; whereas he</span><br/>
<span id='77'>From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Being but fourth of that heroic line.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>But mark: as in this haughty attempt</span><br/>
<span id='80'>They laboured to plant the rightful heir,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>I lost my liberty and they their lives.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived</span><br/>
<span id='85'>From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Marrying my sister that thy mother was,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Again in pity of my hard distress</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Levied an army, weening to redeem</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And have install'd me in the diadem:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>In whom the tide rested, were suppress'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>True; and thou seest that I no issue have</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And that my fainting words do warrant death;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>But yet be wary in thy studious care.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>But yet, methinks, my father's execution</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>With silence, nephew, be thou politic:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And like a mountain, not to be removed.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>But now thy uncle is removing hence:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>As princes do their courts, when they are cloy'd</span><br/>
<span id='106'>With long continuance in a settled place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>O, uncle, would some part of my young years</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Might but redeem the passage of your age!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Only give order for my funeral:</span><br/>
<span id='113'>And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!</span><br/>
<p><em>Dies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!</span><br/>
<span id='116'>In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And what I do imagine let that rest.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Will see his burial better than his life.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Gaolers, bearing out the body of MORTIMER</em></p>
<span id='122'>Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house:</span><br/>
<span id='126'>I doubt not but with honour to redress;</span><br/>
<span id='127'>And therefore haste I to the parliament,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Either to be restored to my blood,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Or make my ill the advantage of my good.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

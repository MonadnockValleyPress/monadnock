<h1>Macbeth</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</h3>
<h4>A camp near Forres.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUNCAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>What bloody man is that? He can report,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt</span><br/>
<span id='3'>The newest state.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>                  This is the sergeant</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Who like a good and hardy soldier fought</span><br/>
<span id='6'>'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Say to the king the knowledge of the broil</span><br/>
<span id='8'>As thou didst leave it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Sergeant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Doubtful it stood;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>As two spent swimmers, that do cling together</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Worthy to be a rebel, for to that</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The multiplying villanies of nature</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Do swarm upon him&mdash;from the western isles</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>For brave Macbeth&mdash;well he deserves that name&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Which smoked with bloody execution,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Like valour's minion carved out his passage</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Till he faced the slave;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And fix'd his head upon our battlements.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DUNCAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Sergeant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>As whence the sun 'gins his reflection</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>No sooner justice had with valour arm'd</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Began a fresh assault.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DUNCAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Dismay'd not this</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Sergeant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Yes;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>If I say sooth, I must report they were</span><br/>
<span id='41'>As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Or memorise another Golgotha,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>I cannot tell.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DUNCAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Sergeant, attended</em></p>
<span id='49'>Who comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ROSS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>                  The worthy thane of Ross.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LENNOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look</span><br/>
<span id='52'>That seems to speak things strange.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>God save the king!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DUNCAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Whence camest thou, worthy thane?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>From Fife, great king;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And fan our people cold. Norway himself,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>With terrible numbers,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Assisted by that most disloyal traitor</span><br/>
<span id='60'>The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Confronted him with self-comparisons,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>The victory fell on us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DUNCAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Great happiness!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>That now</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Nor would we deign him burial of his men</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Ten thousand dollars to our general use.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DUNCAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And with his former title greet Macbeth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>I'll see it done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DUNCAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

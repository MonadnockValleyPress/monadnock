<h1>Winter's Tale</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Before Leontes' palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old</span><br/>
<span id='3'>shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all</span><br/>
<span id='5'>commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I</span><br/>
<span id='6'>heard the shepherd say, he found the child.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>I would most gladly know the issue of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>I make a broken delivery of the business; but the</span><br/>
<span id='9'>changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were</span><br/>
<span id='10'>very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with</span><br/>
<span id='11'>staring on one another, to tear the cases of their</span><br/>
<span id='12'>eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language</span><br/>
<span id='13'>in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard</span><br/>
<span id='14'>of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable</span><br/>
<span id='15'>passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest</span><br/>
<span id='16'>beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not</span><br/>
<span id='17'>say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the</span><br/>
<span id='18'>extremity of the one, it must needs be.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter another Gentleman</em></p>
<span id='19'>Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.</span><br/>
<span id='20'>The news, Rogero?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the</span><br/>
<span id='22'>king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is</span><br/>
<span id='23'>broken out within this hour that ballad-makers</span><br/>
<span id='24'>cannot be able to express it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a third Gentleman</em></p>
<span id='25'>Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can</span><br/>
<span id='26'>deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news</span><br/>
<span id='27'>which is called true is so like an old tale, that</span><br/>
<span id='28'>the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king</span><br/>
<span id='29'>found his heir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by</span><br/>
<span id='31'>circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you</span><br/>
<span id='32'>see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle</span><br/>
<span id='33'>of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>the letters of Antigonus found with it which they</span><br/>
<span id='35'>know to be his character, the majesty of the</span><br/>
<span id='36'>creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection</span><br/>
<span id='37'>of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>and many other evidences proclaim her with all</span><br/>
<span id='39'>certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see</span><br/>
<span id='40'>the meeting of the two kings?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>No.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one</span><br/>
<span id='44'>joy crown another, so and in such manner that it</span><br/>
<span id='45'>seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their</span><br/>
<span id='46'>joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>holding up of hands, with countenances of such</span><br/>
<span id='48'>distraction that they were to be known by garment,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of</span><br/>
<span id='50'>himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that</span><br/>
<span id='51'>joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then</span><br/>
<span id='53'>embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his</span><br/>
<span id='54'>daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old</span><br/>
<span id='55'>shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten</span><br/>
<span id='56'>conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such</span><br/>
<span id='57'>another encounter, which lames report to follow it</span><br/>
<span id='58'>and undoes description to do it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried</span><br/>
<span id='60'>hence the child?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Like an old tale still, which will have matter to</span><br/>
<span id='62'>rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear</span><br/>
<span id='63'>open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this</span><br/>
<span id='64'>avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his</span><br/>
<span id='65'>innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a</span><br/>
<span id='66'>handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>What became of his bark and his followers?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and</span><br/>
<span id='69'>in the view of the shepherd: so that all the</span><br/>
<span id='70'>instruments which aided to expose the child were</span><br/>
<span id='71'>even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble</span><br/>
<span id='72'>combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of</span><br/>
<span id='74'>her husband, another elevated that the oracle was</span><br/>
<span id='75'>fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin</span><br/>
<span id='77'>her to her heart that she might no more be in danger</span><br/>
<span id='78'>of losing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>The dignity of this act was worth the audience of</span><br/>
<span id='80'>kings and princes; for by such was it acted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>One of the prettiest touches of all and that which</span><br/>
<span id='82'>angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not</span><br/>
<span id='83'>the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's</span><br/>
<span id='84'>death, with the manner how she came to't bravely</span><br/>
<span id='85'>confessed and lamented by the king, how</span><br/>
<span id='86'>attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one</span><br/>
<span id='87'>sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'</span><br/>
<span id='88'>I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my</span><br/>
<span id='89'>heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed</span><br/>
<span id='90'>colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world</span><br/>
<span id='91'>could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Are they returned to the court?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>which is in the keeping of Paulina,&mdash;a piece many</span><br/>
<span id='95'>years in doing and now newly performed by that rare</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself</span><br/>
<span id='97'>eternity and could put breath into his work, would</span><br/>
<span id='98'>beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her</span><br/>
<span id='99'>ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that</span><br/>
<span id='100'>they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of</span><br/>
<span id='101'>answer: thither with all greediness of affection</span><br/>
<span id='102'>are they gone, and there they intend to sup.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>I thought she had some great matter there in hand;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever</span><br/>
<span id='105'>since the death of Hermione, visited that removed</span><br/>
<span id='106'>house. Shall we thither and with our company piece</span><br/>
<span id='107'>the rejoicing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?</span><br/>
<span id='109'>every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Let's along.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Gentlemen</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old</span><br/>
<span id='114'>man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard</span><br/>
<span id='115'>them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he</span><br/>
<span id='116'>at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>so he then took her to be, who began to be much</span><br/>
<span id='118'>sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of</span><br/>
<span id='119'>weather continuing, this mystery remained</span><br/>
<span id='120'>undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I</span><br/>
<span id='121'>been the finder out of this secret, it would not</span><br/>
<span id='122'>have relished among my other discredits.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Shepherd and Clown</em></p>
<span id='123'>Here come those I have done good to against my will,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Come, boy; I am past more children, but thy sons and</span><br/>
<span id='126'>daughters will be all gentlemen born.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me</span><br/>
<span id='128'>this other day, because I was no gentleman born.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>See you these clothes? say you see them not and</span><br/>
<span id='130'>think me still no gentleman born: you were best say</span><br/>
<span id='131'>these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the</span><br/>
<span id='132'>lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>And so have I, boy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my</span><br/>
<span id='137'>father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and</span><br/>
<span id='138'>called me brother; and then the two kings called my</span><br/>
<span id='139'>father brother; and then the prince my brother and</span><br/>
<span id='140'>the princess my sister called my father father; and</span><br/>
<span id='141'>so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like</span><br/>
<span id='142'>tears that ever we shed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>We may live, son, to shed many more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so</span><br/>
<span id='145'>preposterous estate as we are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the</span><br/>
<span id='147'>faults I have committed to your worship and to give</span><br/>
<span id='148'>me your good report to the prince my master.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are</span><br/>
<span id='150'>gentlemen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Thou wilt amend thy life?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Ay, an it like your good worship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou</span><br/>
<span id='154'>art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>You may say it, but not swear it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and</span><br/>
<span id='157'>franklins say it, I'll swear it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>How if it be false, son?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear</span><br/>
<span id='160'>it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to</span><br/>
<span id='161'>the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and</span><br/>
<span id='162'>that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no</span><br/>
<span id='163'>tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be</span><br/>
<span id='164'>drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst</span><br/>
<span id='165'>be a tall fellow of thy hands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>I will prove so, sir, to my power.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not</span><br/>
<span id='168'>wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not</span><br/>
<span id='169'>being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings</span><br/>
<span id='170'>and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the</span><br/>
<span id='171'>queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy</span><br/>
<span id='172'>good masters.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

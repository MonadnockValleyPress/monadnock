<h1>Henry IV, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>London. The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>For we shall presently have need of you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Lords</em></p>
<span id='4'>I know not whether God will have it so,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>For some displeasing service I have done,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>That, in his secret doom, out of my blood</span><br/>
<span id='7'>He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>But thou dost in thy passages of life</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Make me believe that thou art only mark'd</span><br/>
<span id='10'>For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Could such inordinate and low desires,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Such barren pleasures, rude society,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Accompany the greatness of thy blood</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And hold their level with thy princely heart?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>So please your majesty, I would I could</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Quit all offences with as clear excuse</span><br/>
<span id='20'>As well as I am doubtless I can purge</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Myself of many I am charged withal:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Yet such extenuation let me beg,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>As, in reproof of many tales devised,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>I may, for some things true, wherein my youth</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Find pardon on my true submission.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>At thy affections, which do hold a wing</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Which by thy younger brother is supplied,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And art almost an alien to the hearts</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Of all the court and princes of my blood:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>The hope and expectation of thy time</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Had I so lavish of my presence been,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>So stale and cheap to vulgar company,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Opinion, that did help me to the crown,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Had still kept loyal to possession</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And left me in reputeless banishment,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>By being seldom seen, I could not stir</span><br/>
<span id='47'>But like a comet I was wonder'd at;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>That men would tell their children 'This is he;'</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And dress'd myself in such humility</span><br/>
<span id='52'>That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Even in the presence of the crowned king.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>My presence, like a robe pontifical,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And won by rareness such solemnity.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>The skipping king, he ambled up and down</span><br/>
<span id='61'>With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Mingled his royalty with capering fools,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Had his great name profaned with their scorns</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And gave his countenance, against his name,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Of every beardless vain comparative,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Grew a companion to the common streets,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>They surfeited with honey and began</span><br/>
<span id='72'>To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little</span><br/>
<span id='73'>More than a little is by much too much.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>So when he had occasion to be seen,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>He was but as the cuckoo is in June,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes</span><br/>
<span id='77'>As, sick and blunted with community,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Afford no extraordinary gaze,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Such as is bent on sun-like majesty</span><br/>
<span id='80'>When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Slept in his face and render'd such aspect</span><br/>
<span id='83'>As cloudy men use to their adversaries,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>For thou has lost thy princely privilege</span><br/>
<span id='87'>With vile participation: not an eye</span><br/>
<span id='88'>But is a-weary of thy common sight,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Which now doth that I would not have it do,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Be more myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>                  For all the world</span><br/>
<span id='95'>As thou art to this hour was Richard then</span><br/>
<span id='96'>When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And even as I was then is Percy now.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>He hath more worthy interest to the state</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Than thou the shadow of succession;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>For of no right, nor colour like to right,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And, being no more in debt to years than thou,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on</span><br/>
<span id='106'>To bloody battles and to bruising arms.</span><br/>
<span id='107'>What never-dying honour hath he got</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Whose hot incursions and great name in arms</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Holds from all soldiers chief majority</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And military title capital</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>This infant warrior, in his enterprises</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Enlarged him and made a friend of him,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>To fill the mouth of deep defiance up</span><br/>
<span id='118'>And shake the peace and safety of our throne.</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Capitulate against us and are up.</span><br/>
<span id='122'>But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Base inclination and the start of spleen</span><br/>
<span id='127'>To fight against me under Percy's pay,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>To show how much thou art degenerate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Do not think so; you shall not find it so:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And God forgive them that so much have sway'd</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!</span><br/>
<span id='133'>I will redeem all this on Percy's head</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And in the closing of some glorious day</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Be bold to tell you that I am your son;</span><br/>
<span id='136'>When I will wear a garment all of blood</span><br/>
<span id='137'>And stain my favours in a bloody mask,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:</span><br/>
<span id='139'>And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>That this same child of honour and renown,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.</span><br/>
<span id='143'>For every honour sitting on his helm,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Would they were multitudes, and on my head</span><br/>
<span id='145'>My shames redoubled! for the time will come,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>That I shall make this northern youth exchange</span><br/>
<span id='147'>His glorious deeds for my indignities.</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Percy is but my factor, good my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;</span><br/>
<span id='150'>And I will call him to so strict account,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>That he shall render every glory up,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.</span><br/>
<span id='154'>This, in the name of God, I promise here:</span><br/>
<span id='155'>The which if He be pleased I shall perform,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>I do beseech your majesty may salve</span><br/>
<span id='157'>The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:</span><br/>
<span id='158'>If not, the end of life cancels all bands;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And I will die a hundred thousand deaths</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>A hundred thousand rebels die in this:</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BLUNT</em></p>
<span id='163'>How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SIR WALTER BLUNT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>So hath the business that I come to speak of.</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word</span><br/>
<span id='166'>That Douglas and the English rebels met</span><br/>
<span id='167'>The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury.</span><br/>
<span id='168'>A mighty and a fearful head they are,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>If promises be kept on every hand,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>As ever offer'd foul play in the state.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;</span><br/>
<span id='173'>For this advertisement is five days old:</span><br/>
<span id='174'>On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;</span><br/>
<span id='175'>On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Through Gloucestershire; by which account,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Our business valued, some twelve days hence</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Our hands are full of business: let's away;</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Coriolanus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene VII</H3>
<h4>A camp, at a small distance from Rome.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter AUFIDIUS and his Lieutenant</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Do they still fly to the Roman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Lieutenant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And you are darken'd in this action, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Even by your own.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>                  I cannot help it now,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Unless, by using means, I lame the foot</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Even to my person, than I thought he would</span><br/>
<span id='11'>When first I did embrace him: yet his nature</span><br/>
<span id='12'>In that's no changeling; and I must excuse</span><br/>
<span id='13'>What cannot be amended.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Lieutenant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Yet I wish, sir,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>I mean for your particular,&mdash;you had not</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Join'd in commission with him; but either</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Had borne the action of yourself, or else</span><br/>
<span id='18'>To him had left it solely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>I understand thee well; and be thou sure,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>when he shall come to his account, he knows not</span><br/>
<span id='21'>What I can urge against him. Although it seems,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And so he thinks, and is no less apparent</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon</span><br/>
<span id='26'>As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone</span><br/>
<span id='27'>That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Whene'er we come to our account.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Lieutenant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>All places yield to him ere he sits down;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And the nobility of Rome are his:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>The senators and patricians love him too:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty</span><br/>
<span id='35'>To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome</span><br/>
<span id='36'>As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it</span><br/>
<span id='37'>By sovereignty of nature. First he was</span><br/>
<span id='38'>A noble servant to them; but he could not</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Which out of daily fortune ever taints</span><br/>
<span id='41'>The happy man; whether defect of judgment,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>To fail in the disposing of those chances</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Which he was lord of; or whether nature,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Not to be other than one thing, not moving</span><br/>
<span id='45'>From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Even with the same austerity and garb</span><br/>
<span id='47'>As he controll'd the war; but one of these&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>As he hath spices of them all, not all,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>For I dare so far free him&mdash;made him fear'd,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Lie in the interpretation of the time:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And power, unto itself most commendable,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair</span><br/>
<span id='55'>To extol what it hath done.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

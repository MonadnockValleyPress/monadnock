<h1>Henry V</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene VII</h3>
<h4>The French camp, near Agincourt.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the Constable of France, the LORD RAMBURES, ORLEANS, DAUPHIN, with others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Tut! I have the best armour of the world. Would it were day!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>You have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his due.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>It is the best horse of Europe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Will it never be morning?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>My lord of Orleans, and my lord high constable, you</span><br/>
<span id='6'>talk of horse and armour?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>What a long night is this! I will not change my</span><br/>
<span id='9'>horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his</span><br/>
<span id='11'>entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the Pegasus,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him, I</span><br/>
<span id='13'>soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth</span><br/>
<span id='14'>sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his</span><br/>
<span id='15'>hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>He's of the colour of the nutmeg.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull</span><br/>
<span id='19'>elements of earth and water never appear in him, but</span><br/>
<span id='20'>only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts</span><br/>
<span id='21'>him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you</span><br/>
<span id='22'>may call beasts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the</span><br/>
<span id='25'>bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>No more, cousin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the</span><br/>
<span id='28'>rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary</span><br/>
<span id='29'>deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as</span><br/>
<span id='30'>fluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquent</span><br/>
<span id='31'>tongues, and my horse is argument for them all:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for</span><br/>
<span id='33'>a sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for the</span><br/>
<span id='34'>world, familiar to us and unknown to lay apart</span><br/>
<span id='35'>their particular functions and wonder at him. I</span><br/>
<span id='36'>once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>'Wonder of nature,'&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Then did they imitate that which I composed to my</span><br/>
<span id='40'>courser, for my horse is my mistress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Your mistress bears well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Me well; which is the prescript praise and</span><br/>
<span id='43'>perfection of a good and particular mistress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly</span><br/>
<span id='45'>shook your back.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>So perhaps did yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Mine was not bridled.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>O then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and in</span><br/>
<span id='50'>your straight strossers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>You have good judgment in horsemanship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Be warned by me, then: they that ride so and ride</span><br/>
<span id='53'>not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have</span><br/>
<span id='54'>my horse to my mistress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>I had as lief have my mistress a jade.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow</span><br/>
<span id='58'>to my mistress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement, et</span><br/>
<span id='60'>la truie lavee au bourbier;' thou makest use of any thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or any</span><br/>
<span id='62'>such proverb so little kin to the purpose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>RAMBURES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>My lord constable, the armour that I saw in your tent</span><br/>
<span id='64'>to-night, are those stars or suns upon it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Stars, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>And yet my sky shall not want.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and</span><br/>
<span id='69'>'twere more honour some were away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Even as your horse bears your praises; who would</span><br/>
<span id='71'>trot as well, were some of your brags dismounted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will</span><br/>
<span id='73'>it never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, and</span><br/>
<span id='74'>my way shall be paved with English faces.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out of</span><br/>
<span id='76'>my way: but I would it were morning; for I would</span><br/>
<span id='77'>fain be about the ears of the English.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>RAMBURES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>You must first go yourself to hazard, ere you have them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>'Tis midnight; I'll go arm myself.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>The Dauphin longs for morning.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>RAMBURES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>He longs to eat the English.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>I think he will eat all he kills.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>He is simply the most active gentleman of France.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Doing is activity; and he will still be doing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>He never did harm, that I heard of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that good name still.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>I know him to be valiant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>I was told that  by one that knows him better than</span><br/>
<span id='92'>you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>What's he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he cared</span><br/>
<span id='95'>not who knew it</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>By my faith, sir, but it is; never any body saw it</span><br/>
<span id='98'>but his lackey: 'tis a hooded valour; and when it</span><br/>
<span id='99'>appears, it will bate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Ill will never said well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Well placed: there stands your friend for the</span><br/>
<span id='104'>devil: have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A</span><br/>
<span id='105'>pox of the devil.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>You are the better at proverbs, by how much 'A</span><br/>
<span id='107'>fool's bolt is soon shot.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>You have shot over.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>'Tis not the first time you were overshot.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>My lord high constable, the English lie within</span><br/>
<span id='111'>fifteen hundred paces of your tents.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Who hath measured the ground?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>The Lord Grandpre.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it were</span><br/>
<span id='115'>day! Alas, poor Harry of England! he longs not for</span><br/>
<span id='116'>the dawning as we do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of</span><br/>
<span id='118'>England, to mope with his fat-brained followers so</span><br/>
<span id='119'>far out of his knowledge!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>That they lack; for if their heads had any</span><br/>
<span id='122'>intellectual armour, they could never wear such heavy</span><br/>
<span id='123'>head-pieces.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>RAMBURES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>That island of England breeds very valiant</span><br/>
<span id='125'>creatures; their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Russian bear and have their heads crushed like</span><br/>
<span id='128'>rotten apples! You may as well say, that's a</span><br/>
<span id='129'>valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Just, just; and the men do sympathize with the</span><br/>
<span id='131'>mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving</span><br/>
<span id='132'>their wits with their wives: and then give them</span><br/>
<span id='133'>great meals of beef and iron and steel, they will</span><br/>
<span id='134'>eat like wolves and fight like devils.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs</span><br/>
<span id='137'>to eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>come, shall we about it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>It is now two o'clock: but, let me see, by ten</span><br/>
<span id='140'>We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

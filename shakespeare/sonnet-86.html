<h3>LXXXVI</h3>
<p>
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,<br/>
Bound for the prize of all too precious you,<br/>
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,<br/>
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?<br/>
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,<br/>
Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?<br/>
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night<br/>
Giving him aid, my verse astonished.<br/>
He, nor that affable familiar ghost<br/>
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,<br/>
As victors of my silence cannot boast;<br/>
I was not sick of any fear from thence:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when your countenance fill'd up his line,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.<br/>

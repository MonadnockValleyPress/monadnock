<h4>Paris. The King's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>You have it from his own deliverance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>And by other warranted testimony.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in</span><br/>
<span id='7'>knowledge and accordingly valiant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>I have then sinned against his experience and</span><br/>
<span id='9'>transgressed against his valour; and my state that</span><br/>
<span id='10'>way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my</span><br/>
<span id='11'>heart to repent. Here he comes: I pray you, make</span><br/>
<span id='12'>us friends; I will pursue the amity.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PAROLLES</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>[To BERTRAM]  These things shall be done, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>O, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir, 's a good</span><br/>
<span id='17'>workman, a very good tailor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>[Aside to PAROLLES]  Is she gone to the king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>She is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Will she away to-night?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>As you'll have her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Given order for our horses; and to-night,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>When I should take possession of the bride,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>End ere I do begin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>A good traveller is something at the latter end of a</span><br/>
<span id='27'>dinner; but one that lies three thirds and uses a</span><br/>
<span id='28'>known truth to pass a thousand nothings with, should</span><br/>
<span id='29'>be once heard and thrice beaten. God save you, captain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's</span><br/>
<span id='32'>displeasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs</span><br/>
<span id='34'>and all, like him that leaped into the custard; and</span><br/>
<span id='35'>out of it you'll run again, rather than suffer</span><br/>
<span id='36'>question for your residence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>And shall do so ever, though I took him at 's</span><br/>
<span id='39'>prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and believe this</span><br/>
<span id='40'>of me, there can be no kernel in this light nut; the</span><br/>
<span id='41'>soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in</span><br/>
<span id='42'>matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them</span><br/>
<span id='43'>tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>I have spoken better of you than you have or will to</span><br/>
<span id='45'>deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>An idle lord. I swear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>I think so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Why, do you not know him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Yes, I do know him well, and common speech</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HELENA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Spoke with the king and have procured his leave</span><br/>
<span id='53'>For present parting; only he desires</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Some private speech with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>I shall obey his will.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Which holds not colour with the time, nor does</span><br/>
<span id='58'>The ministration and required office</span><br/>
<span id='59'>On my particular. Prepared I was not</span><br/>
<span id='60'>For such a business; therefore am I found</span><br/>
<span id='61'>So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you</span><br/>
<span id='62'>That presently you take our way for home;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>For my respects are better than they seem</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And my appointments have in them a need</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Greater than shows itself at the first view</span><br/>
<span id='67'>To you that know them not. This to my mother:</span><br/>
<p><em>Giving a letter</em></p>
<span id='68'>'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so</span><br/>
<span id='69'>I leave you to your wisdom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Sir, I can nothing say,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>But that I am your most obedient servant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Come, come, no more of that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>And ever shall</span><br/>
<span id='74'>With true observance seek to eke out that</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd</span><br/>
<span id='76'>To equal my great fortune.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Let that go:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Pray, sir, your pardon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Well, what would you say?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal</span><br/>
<span id='84'>What law does vouch mine own.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>What would you have?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.</span><br/>
<span id='87'>I would not tell you what I would, my lord:</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Faith yes;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit HELENA</em></p>
<span id='93'>Go thou toward home; where I will never come</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Away, and for our flight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Bravely, coragio!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Twelfth Night</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene V</h3>
<h4>Olivia's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter MARIA and Clown</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will</span><br/>
<span id='2'>not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in</span><br/>
<span id='3'>way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this</span><br/>
<span id='5'>world needs to fear no colours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Make that good.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>He shall see none to fear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that</span><br/>
<span id='9'>saying was born, of 'I fear no colours.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Where, good Mistress Mary?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those</span><br/>
<span id='13'>that are fools, let them use their talents.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>for turning away, let summer bear it out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>You are resolute, then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both</span><br/>
<span id='21'>break, your gaskins fall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way; if</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a</span><br/>
<span id='24'>piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my</span><br/>
<span id='26'>lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft</span><br/>
<span id='29'>prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may</span><br/>
<span id='30'>pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?</span><br/>
<span id='31'>'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO</em></p>
<span id='32'>God bless thee, lady!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Take the fool away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>besides, you grow dishonest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel</span><br/>
<span id='38'>will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is</span><br/>
<span id='39'>the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend</span><br/>
<span id='40'>himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if</span><br/>
<span id='41'>he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing</span><br/>
<span id='42'>that's mended is but patched: virtue that</span><br/>
<span id='43'>transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that</span><br/>
<span id='44'>amends is but patched with virtue. If that this</span><br/>
<span id='45'>simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but</span><br/>
<span id='47'>calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take</span><br/>
<span id='48'>away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Sir, I bade them take away you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non</span><br/>
<span id='51'>facit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear not</span><br/>
<span id='52'>motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to</span><br/>
<span id='53'>prove you a fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Can you do it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Dexterously, good madonna.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Make your proof.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>I must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouse</span><br/>
<span id='58'>of virtue, answer me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Good madonna, why mournest thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Good fool, for my brother's death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I think his soul is in hell, madonna.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>I know his soul is in heaven, fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's</span><br/>
<span id='65'>soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the</span><br/>
<span id='69'>better fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the</span><br/>
<span id='71'>better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be</span><br/>
<span id='72'>sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his</span><br/>
<span id='73'>word for two pence that you are no fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>How say you to that, Malvolio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a</span><br/>
<span id='76'>barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day</span><br/>
<span id='77'>with an ordinary fool that has no more brain</span><br/>
<span id='78'>than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard</span><br/>
<span id='79'>already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to</span><br/>
<span id='80'>him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better</span><br/>
<span id='82'>than the fools' zanies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste</span><br/>
<span id='84'>with a distempered appetite. To be generous,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>guiltless and of free disposition, is to take those</span><br/>
<span id='86'>things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:</span><br/>
<span id='87'>there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do</span><br/>
<span id='88'>nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet</span><br/>
<span id='89'>man, though he do nothing but reprove.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou</span><br/>
<span id='91'>speakest well of fools!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter MARIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much</span><br/>
<span id='93'>desires to speak with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>From the Count Orsino, is it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Who of my people hold him in delay?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but</span><br/>
<span id='99'>madman: fie on him!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit MARIA</em></p>
<span id='100'>Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, I</span><br/>
<span id='101'>am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit MALVOLIO</em></p>
<span id='102'>Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and</span><br/>
<span id='103'>people dislike it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest</span><br/>
<span id='105'>son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with</span><br/>
<span id='106'>brains! for,&mdash;here he comes,&mdash;one of thy kin has a</span><br/>
<span id='107'>most weak pia mater.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SIR TOBY BELCH</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>A gentleman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>A gentleman! what gentleman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>'Tis a gentle man here&mdash;a plague o' these</span><br/>
<span id='112'>pickle-herring! How now, sot!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Good Sir Toby!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Ay, marry, what is he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not: give</span><br/>
<span id='118'>me faith, say I. Well, it's all one.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>What's a drunken man like, fool?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man: one</span><br/>
<span id='121'>draught above heat makes him a fool; the second mads</span><br/>
<span id='122'>him; and a third drowns him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my</span><br/>
<span id='124'>coz; for he's in the third degree of drink, he's</span><br/>
<span id='125'>drowned: go, look after him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>He is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look</span><br/>
<span id='127'>to the madman.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter MALVOLIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with</span><br/>
<span id='129'>you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to</span><br/>
<span id='130'>understand so much, and therefore comes to speak</span><br/>
<span id='131'>with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to</span><br/>
<span id='132'>have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore</span><br/>
<span id='133'>comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>lady? he's fortified against any denial.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Tell him he shall not speak with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your</span><br/>
<span id='137'>door like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to</span><br/>
<span id='138'>a bench, but he'll speak with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>What kind o' man is he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Why, of mankind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>What manner of man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Of what personage and years is he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for</span><br/>
<span id='145'>a boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a</span><br/>
<span id='146'>cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him</span><br/>
<span id='147'>in standing water, between boy and man. He is very</span><br/>
<span id='148'>well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; one</span><br/>
<span id='149'>would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Gentlewoman, my lady calls.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter MARIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.</span><br/>
<span id='153'>We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter VIOLA, and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>The honourable lady of the house, which is she?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>Speak to me; I shall answer for her.</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Your will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,&mdash;I</span><br/>
<span id='158'>pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away</span><br/>
<span id='160'>my speech, for besides that it is excellently well</span><br/>
<span id='161'>penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good</span><br/>
<span id='162'>beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very</span><br/>
<span id='163'>comptible, even to the least sinister usage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Whence came you, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>I can say little more than I have studied, and that</span><br/>
<span id='166'>question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me</span><br/>
<span id='167'>modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>that I may proceed in my speech.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>Are you a comedian?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs</span><br/>
<span id='171'>of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you</span><br/>
<span id='172'>the lady of the house?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>If I do not usurp myself, I am.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp</span><br/>
<span id='175'>yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours</span><br/>
<span id='176'>to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will</span><br/>
<span id='177'>on with my speech in your praise, and then show you</span><br/>
<span id='178'>the heart of my message.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you</span><br/>
<span id='184'>than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if</span><br/>
<span id='185'>you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of</span><br/>
<span id='186'>moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little</span><br/>
<span id='189'>longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet</span><br/>
<span id='190'>lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when</span><br/>
<span id='192'>the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of</span><br/>
<span id='194'>war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my</span><br/>
<span id='195'>hand; my words are as full of peace as matter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech89'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I</span><br/>
<span id='198'>learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I</span><br/>
<span id='199'>would, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>divinity, to any other's, profanation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech90'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt MARIA and Attendants</em></p>
<span id='202'>Now, sir, what is your text?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech91'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>Most sweet lady,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech92'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Where lies your text?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech93'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>In Orsino's bosom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech94'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='207'>In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech95'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech96'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='209'>O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech97'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>Good madam, let me see your face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech98'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='211'>Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate</span><br/>
<span id='212'>with my face? You are now out of your text: but</span><br/>
<span id='213'>we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't</span><br/>
<span id='215'>not well done?</span><br/>
<p><em>Unveiling</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech99'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>Excellently done, if God did all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech100'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.</span><br/>

<h1>Coriolanus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene II</H3>
<h4>Entrance of the Volscian camp before Rome.</h4>

<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Two Sentinels on guard.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter to them, MENENIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Stay: whence are you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Stand, and go back.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I am an officer of state, and come</span><br/>
<span id='6'>To speak with Coriolanus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>From whence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>From Rome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>First Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>You may not pass, you must return: our general</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Will no more hear from thence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Second Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before</span><br/>
<span id='12'>You'll speak with Coriolanus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Good my friends,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>If you have heard your general talk of Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>First Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Is not here passable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>I tell thee, fellow,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>The general is my lover: I have been</span><br/>
<span id='21'>The book of his good acts, whence men have read</span><br/>
<span id='22'>His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>For I have ever verified my friends,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>I must have leave to pass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>First Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his</span><br/>
<span id='31'>behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you</span><br/>
<span id='32'>should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous</span><br/>
<span id='33'>to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>always factionary on the party of your general.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Second Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you</span><br/>
<span id='37'>have, I am one that, telling true under him, must</span><br/>
<span id='38'>say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not</span><br/>
<span id='40'>speak with him till after dinner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>You are a Roman, are you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>I am, as thy general is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>First Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>when you have pushed out your gates the very</span><br/>
<span id='45'>defender of them, and, in a violent popular</span><br/>
<span id='46'>ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to</span><br/>
<span id='47'>front his revenges with the easy groans of old</span><br/>
<span id='48'>women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with</span><br/>
<span id='49'>the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as</span><br/>
<span id='50'>you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the</span><br/>
<span id='51'>intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with</span><br/>
<span id='52'>such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your</span><br/>
<span id='54'>execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn</span><br/>
<span id='55'>you out of reprieve and pardon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would</span><br/>
<span id='57'>use me with estimation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Second Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Come, my captain knows you not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>I mean, thy general.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>First Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest</span><br/>
<span id='61'>I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,&mdash;that's</span><br/>
<span id='62'>the utmost of your having: back.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Nay, but, fellow, fellow,&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>What's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall</span><br/>
<span id='67'>perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from</span><br/>
<span id='68'>my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment</span><br/>
<span id='69'>with him, if thou standest not i' the state of</span><br/>
<span id='70'>hanging, or of some death more long in</span><br/>
<span id='71'>spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now</span><br/>
<span id='72'>presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>To CORIOLANUS</em></p>
<span id='73'>The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy</span><br/>
<span id='74'>particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than</span><br/>
<span id='75'>thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!</span><br/>
<span id='76'>thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's</span><br/>
<span id='77'>water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to</span><br/>
<span id='78'>thee; but being assured none but myself could move</span><br/>
<span id='79'>thee, I have been blown out of your gates with</span><br/>
<span id='80'>sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy</span><br/>
<span id='81'>petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy</span><br/>
<span id='82'>wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet</span><br/>
<span id='83'>here,&mdash;this, who, like a block, hath denied my</span><br/>
<span id='84'>access to thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Away!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>How! away!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Are servanted to others: though I owe</span><br/>
<span id='89'>My revenge properly, my remission lies</span><br/>
<span id='90'>In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Mine ears against your suits are stronger than</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Take this along; I writ it for thy sake</span><br/>
<p><em>Gives a letter</em></p>
<span id='96'>And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>You keep a constant temper.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>First Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Now, sir, is your name Menenius?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>Second Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>'Tis a spell, you see, of much  power: you know the</span><br/>
<span id='102'>way home again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>First Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your</span><br/>
<span id='104'>greatness back?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>Second Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>I neither care for the world nor your general: for</span><br/>
<span id='107'>such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by</span><br/>
<span id='109'>himself fears it not from another: let your general</span><br/>
<span id='110'>do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and</span><br/>
<span id='111'>your misery increase with your age! I say to you,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>as I was said to, Away!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>First Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>A noble fellow, I warrant him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>Second Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the</span><br/>
<span id='115'>oak not to be wind-shaken.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

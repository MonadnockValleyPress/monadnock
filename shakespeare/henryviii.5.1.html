<h4>London. A gallery in the palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GARDINER, Bishop of Winchester, a Page with a torch before him, met by LOVELL</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>It's one o'clock, boy, is't not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Boy</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>It hath struck.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>These should be hours for necessities,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Not for delights; times to repair our nature</span><br/>
<span id='5'>With comforting repose, and not for us</span><br/>
<span id='6'>To waste these times. Good hour of night, Sir Thomas!</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Whither so late?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>                  Came you from the king, my lord</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>I did, Sir Thomas: and left him at primero</span><br/>
<span id='10'>With the Duke of Suffolk.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>I must to him too,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Before he go to bed. I'll take my leave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What's the matter?</span><br/>
<span id='14'>It seems you are in haste: an if there be</span><br/>
<span id='15'>No great offence belongs to't, give your friend</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Some touch of your late business: affairs, that walk,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>As they say spirits do, at midnight, have</span><br/>
<span id='18'>In them a wilder nature than the business</span><br/>
<span id='19'>That seeks dispatch by day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>My lord, I love you;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And durst commend a secret to your ear</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Much weightier than this work. The queen's in labour,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>They say, in great extremity; and fear'd</span><br/>
<span id='24'>She'll with the labour end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>The fruit she goes with</span><br/>
<span id='26'>I pray for heartily, that it may find</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Good time, and live: but for the stock, Sir Thomas,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I wish it grubb'd up now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Methinks I could</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says</span><br/>
<span id='31'>She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Deserve our better wishes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>But, sir, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Hear me, Sir Thomas: you're a gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Of mine own way; I know you wise, religious;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And, let me tell you, it will ne'er be well,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Till Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Sleep in their graves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Now, sir, you speak of two</span><br/>
<span id='41'>The most remark'd i' the kingdom. As for Cromwell,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Beside that of the jewel house, is made master</span><br/>
<span id='43'>O' the rolls, and the king's secretary; further, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>With which the time will load him. The archbishop</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Is the king's hand and tongue; and who dare speak</span><br/>
<span id='47'>One syllable against him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Yes, yes, Sir Thomas,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>There are that dare; and I myself have ventured</span><br/>
<span id='50'>To speak my mind of him: and indeed this day,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Sir, I may tell it you, I think I have</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Incensed the lords o' the council, that he is,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>For so I know he is, they know he is,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>A most arch heretic, a pestilence</span><br/>
<span id='55'>That does infect the land: with which they moved</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Have broken with the king; who hath so far</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Given ear to our complaint, of his great grace</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Our reasons laid before him, hath commanded</span><br/>
<span id='60'>To-morrow morning to the council-board</span><br/>
<span id='61'>He be convented. He's a rank weed, Sir Thomas,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And we must root him out. From your affairs</span><br/>
<span id='63'>I hinder you too long: good night, Sir Thomas.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Many good nights, my lord: I rest your servant.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt GARDINER and Page</em></p>
<p><em>Enter KING HENRY VIII and SUFFOLK</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Charles, I will play no more tonight;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>My mind's not on't; you are too hard for me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Sir, I did never win of you before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>But little, Charles;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Nor shall not, when my fancy's on my play.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>I could not personally deliver to her</span><br/>
<span id='72'>What you commanded me, but by her woman</span><br/>
<span id='73'>I sent your message; who return'd her thanks</span><br/>
<span id='74'>In the great'st humbleness, and desired your highness</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Most heartily to pray for her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>What say'st thou, ha?</span><br/>
<span id='77'>To pray for her? what, is she crying out?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>So said her woman; and that her sufferance made</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Almost each pang a death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Alas, good lady!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>God safely quit her of her burthen, and</span><br/>
<span id='82'>With gentle travail, to the gladding of</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Your highness with an heir!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>'Tis midnight, Charles;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Prithee, to bed; and in thy prayers remember</span><br/>
<span id='86'>The estate of my poor queen. Leave me alone;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>For I must think of that which company</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Would not be friendly to.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>I wish your highness</span><br/>
<span id='90'>A quiet night; and my good mistress will</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Remember in my prayers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Charles, good night.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit SUFFOLK</em></p>
<p><em>Enter DENNY</em></p>
<span id='93'>Well, sir, what follows?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DENNY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Sir, I have brought my lord the archbishop,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>As you commanded me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Ha! Canterbury?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DENNY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Ay, my good lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>'Tis true: where is he, Denny?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DENNY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>He attends your highness' pleasure.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit DENNY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>[Aside]  This is about that which the bishop spake:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>I am happily come hither.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter DENNY, with CRANMER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Avoid the gallery.</span><br/>
<p><em>LOVELL seems to stay</em></p>
<span id='103'>Ha! I have said. Be gone. What!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt LOVELL and DENNY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>[Aside]</span><br/>
<span id='105'>I am fearful: wherefore frowns he thus?</span><br/>
<span id='106'>'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>How now, my lord! you desire to know</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Wherefore I sent for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>[Kneeling]              It is my duty</span><br/>
<span id='110'>To attend your highness' pleasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Pray you, arise,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Come, you and I must walk a turn together;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>I have news to tell you: come, come, give me your hand.</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And am right sorry to repeat what follows</span><br/>
<span id='117'>I have, and most unwillingly, of late</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Heard many grievous, I do say, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Grievous complaints of you; which, being consider'd,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Have moved us and our council, that you shall</span><br/>
<span id='121'>This morning come before us; where, I know,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>You cannot with such freedom purge yourself,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>But that, till further trial in those charges</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Which will require your answer, you must take</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Your patience to you, and be well contented</span><br/>
<span id='126'>To make your house our Tower: you a brother of us,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>It fits we thus proceed, or else no witness</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Would come against you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>[Kneeling]</span><br/>
<span id='130'>I humbly thank your highness;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And am right glad to catch this good occasion</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Most throughly to be winnow'd, where my chaff</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And corn shall fly asunder: for, I know,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>There's none stands under more calumnious tongues</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Than I myself, poor man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Stand up, good Canterbury:</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted</span><br/>
<span id='138'>In us, thy friend: give me thy hand, stand up:</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Prithee, let's walk. Now, by my holidame.</span><br/>
<span id='140'>What manner of man are you? My lord, I look'd</span><br/>
<span id='141'>You would have given me your petition, that</span><br/>
<span id='142'>I should have ta'en some pains to bring together</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Yourself and your accusers; and to have heard you,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Without indurance, further.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Most dread liege,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>The good I stand on is my truth and honesty:</span><br/>
<span id='147'>If they shall fail, I, with mine enemies,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Will triumph o'er my person; which I weigh not,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing</span><br/>
<span id='150'>What can be said against me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Know you not</span><br/>
<span id='152'>How your state stands i' the world, with the whole world?</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Your enemies are many, and not small; their practises</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Must bear the same proportion; and not ever</span><br/>
<span id='155'>The justice and the truth o' the question carries</span><br/>
<span id='156'>The due o' the verdict with it: at what ease</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt</span><br/>
<span id='158'>To swear against you? such things have been done.</span><br/>
<span id='159'>You are potently opposed; and with a malice</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>I mean, in perjured witness, than your master,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Whose minister you are, whiles here he lived</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Upon this naughty earth? Go to, go to;</span><br/>
<span id='164'>You take a precipice for no leap of danger,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>And woo your own destruction.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>God and your majesty</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Protect mine innocence, or I fall into</span><br/>
<span id='168'>The trap is laid for me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>Be of good cheer;</span><br/>
<span id='170'>They shall no more prevail than we give way to.</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Keep comfort to you; and this morning see</span><br/>
<span id='172'>You do appear before them: if they shall chance,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>In charging you with matters, to commit you,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>The best persuasions to the contrary</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Fail not to use, and with what vehemency</span><br/>
<span id='176'>The occasion shall instruct you: if entreaties</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Will render you no remedy, this ring</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Deliver them, and your appeal to us</span><br/>
<span id='179'>There make before them. Look, the good man weeps!</span><br/>
<span id='180'>He's honest, on mine honour. God's blest mother!</span><br/>
<span id='181'>I swear he is true&mdash;hearted; and a soul</span><br/>
<span id='182'>None better in my kingdom. Get you gone,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>And do as I have bid you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit CRANMER</em></p>
<span id='184'>He has strangled</span><br/>
<span id='185'>His language in his tears.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Old Lady, LOVELL following</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>[Within]                 Come back: what mean you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Old Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>I'll not come back; the tidings that I bring</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Will make my boldness manners. Now, good angels</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Fly o'er thy royal head, and shade thy person</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Under their blessed wings!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>Now, by thy looks</span><br/>
<span id='192'>I guess thy message. Is the queen deliver'd?</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Say, ay; and of a boy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Old Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>Ay, ay, my liege;</span><br/>
<span id='195'>And of a lovely boy: the God of heaven</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Both now and ever bless her! 'tis a girl,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Desires your visitation, and to be</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Acquainted with this stranger 'tis as like you</span><br/>
<span id='200'>As cherry is to cherry.</span><br/>

<span id='207'>Said I for this, the girl was like to him?</span><br/>
<span id='208'>I will have more, or else unsay't; and now,</span><br/>

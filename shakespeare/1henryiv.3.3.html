<h3>Act III, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.</h4>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last</span><br/>
<span id='2'>action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my</span><br/>
<span id='3'>skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose</span><br/>
<span id='4'>gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some</span><br/>
<span id='6'>liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I</span><br/>
<span id='7'>shall have no strength to repent. An I have not</span><br/>
<span id='8'>forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I</span><br/>
<span id='9'>am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a</span><br/>
<span id='10'>church! Company, villanous company, hath been the</span><br/>
<span id='11'>spoil of me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make</span><br/>
<span id='14'>me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='15'>need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not</span><br/>
<span id='16'>above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once</span><br/>
<span id='17'>in a quarter&mdash;of an hour; paid money that I</span><br/>
<span id='18'>borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in</span><br/>
<span id='19'>good compass: and now I live out of all order, out</span><br/>
<span id='20'>of all compass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs</span><br/>
<span id='22'>be out of all compass, out of all reasonable</span><br/>
<span id='23'>compass, Sir John.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in</span><br/>
<span id='26'>the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Knight of the Burning Lamp.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many</span><br/>
<span id='30'>a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I</span><br/>
<span id='31'>never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his</span><br/>
<span id='33'>robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way</span><br/>
<span id='34'>given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath</span><br/>
<span id='35'>should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but</span><br/>
<span id='36'>thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but</span><br/>
<span id='37'>for the light in thy face, the son of utter</span><br/>
<span id='38'>darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the</span><br/>
<span id='39'>night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou</span><br/>
<span id='40'>hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a</span><br/>
<span id='42'>perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and</span><br/>
<span id='44'>torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt</span><br/>
<span id='45'>tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast</span><br/>
<span id='46'>drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap</span><br/>
<span id='47'>at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have</span><br/>
<span id='48'>maintained that salamander of yours with fire any</span><br/>
<span id='49'>time this two and thirty years; God reward me for</span><br/>
<span id='50'>it!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Hostess</em></p>
<span id='53'>How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired</span><br/>
<span id='54'>yet who picked my pocket?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you</span><br/>
<span id='56'>think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy</span><br/>
<span id='58'>by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair</span><br/>
<span id='59'>was never lost in my house before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many</span><br/>
<span id='61'>a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go</span><br/>
<span id='62'>to, you are a woman, go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Who, I? no; I defy thee: God's light, I was never</span><br/>
<span id='64'>called so in mine own house before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Go to, I know you well enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>No, Sir John; You do not know me, Sir John. I know</span><br/>
<span id='67'>you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now</span><br/>
<span id='68'>you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought</span><br/>
<span id='69'>you a dozen of shirts to your back.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to</span><br/>
<span id='71'>bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight</span><br/>
<span id='73'>shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir</span><br/>
<span id='74'>John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent</span><br/>
<span id='75'>you, four and twenty pound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>He had his part of it; let him pay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?</span><br/>
<span id='79'>let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I'll not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker</span><br/>
<span id='81'>of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I</span><br/>
<span id='82'>shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a</span><br/>
<span id='83'>seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not</span><br/>
<span id='85'>how oft, that ring was copper!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an</span><br/>
<span id='87'>he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he</span><br/>
<span id='88'>would say so.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PRINCE HENRY and PETO, marching, and FALSTAFF meets them playing on his truncheon like a life</em></p>
<span id='89'>How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?</span><br/>
<span id='90'>must we all march?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>My lord, I pray you, hear me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy</span><br/>
<span id='94'>husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Good my lord, hear me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>What sayest thou, Jack?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras</span><br/>
<span id='99'>and had my pocket picked: this house is turned</span><br/>
<span id='100'>bawdy-house; they pick pockets.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>What didst thou lose, Jack?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of</span><br/>
<span id='103'>forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my</span><br/>
<span id='104'>grandfather's.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>A trifle, some eight-penny matter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your</span><br/>
<span id='107'>grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely</span><br/>
<span id='108'>of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said</span><br/>
<span id='109'>he would cudgel you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>What! he did not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed</span><br/>
<span id='113'>prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn</span><br/>
<span id='114'>fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the</span><br/>
<span id='115'>deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Say, what thing? what thing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou</span><br/>
<span id='120'>shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to</span><br/>
<span id='122'>call me so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say</span><br/>
<span id='124'>otherwise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>What beast! why, an otter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not</span><br/>
<span id='129'>where to have her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any</span><br/>
<span id='131'>man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you</span><br/>
<span id='134'>ought him a thousand pound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth</span><br/>
<span id='137'>a million: thou owest me thy love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would</span><br/>
<span id='139'>cudgel you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Did I, Bardolph?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Indeed, Sir John, you said so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Yea, if he said my ring was copper.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:</span><br/>
<span id='145'>but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the</span><br/>
<span id='146'>roaring of a lion's whelp.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>And why not as the lion?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou</span><br/>
<span id='149'>think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an</span><br/>
<span id='150'>I do, I pray God my girdle break.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy</span><br/>
<span id='152'>knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all</span><br/>
<span id='154'>filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest</span><br/>
<span id='155'>woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in</span><br/>
<span id='157'>thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of</span><br/>
<span id='158'>bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of</span><br/>
<span id='159'>sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket</span><br/>
<span id='160'>were enriched with any other injuries but these, I</span><br/>
<span id='161'>am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will</span><br/>
<span id='162'>not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of</span><br/>
<span id='164'>innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I</span><br/>
<span id='166'>have more flesh than another man, and therefore more</span><br/>
<span id='167'>frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>It appears so by the story.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;</span><br/>
<span id='170'>love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy</span><br/>
<span id='171'>guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest</span><br/>
<span id='172'>reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>prithee, be gone.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Hostess</em></p>
<span id='174'>Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>lad, how is that answered?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to</span><br/>
<span id='177'>thee: the money is paid back again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>O, I do not like that paying back; 'tis a double labour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and</span><br/>
<span id='181'>do it with unwashed hands too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>Do, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find</span><br/>
<span id='185'>one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the</span><br/>
<span id='186'>age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am</span><br/>
<span id='187'>heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for</span><br/>
<span id='188'>these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I</span><br/>
<span id='189'>laud them, I praise them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>Bardolph!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>My lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, to my</span><br/>
<span id='193'>brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Bardolph</em></p>
<span id='194'>Go, Peto, to horse, to horse; for thou and I have</span><br/>
<span id='195'>thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Peto</em></p>
<span id='196'>Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two</span><br/>
<span id='197'>o'clock in the afternoon.</span><br/>
<span id='198'>There shalt thou know thy charge; and there receive</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Money and order for their furniture.</span><br/>
<span id='200'>The land is burning; Percy stands on high;</span><br/>
<span id='201'>And either we or they must lower lie.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit PRINCE HENRY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!</span><br/>
<span id='203'>O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<h1>Julius Caesar</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The same. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides, CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CICERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen</span><br/>
<span id='7'>The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>To be exalted with the threatening clouds:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>But never till to-night, never till now,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Either there is a civil strife in heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Incenses them to send destruction.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>CICERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>A common slave&mdash;you know him well by sight&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Besides&mdash;I ha' not since put up my sword&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Against the Capitol I met a lion,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Who glared upon me, and went surly by,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Without annoying me: and there were drawn</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And yesterday the bird of night did sit</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Even at noon-day upon the market-place,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Do so conjointly meet, let not men say</span><br/>
<span id='30'>'These are their reasons; they are natural;'</span><br/>
<span id='31'>For, I believe, they are portentous things</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Unto the climate that they point upon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CICERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>But men may construe things after their fashion,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>He doth; for he did bid Antonius</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CICERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Is not to walk in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Farewell, Cicero.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit CICERO</em></p>
<p><em>Enter CASSIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Who's there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>                  A Roman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Casca, by your voice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>A very pleasing night to honest men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Who ever knew the heavens menace so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Those that have known the earth so full of faults.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Submitting me unto the perilous night,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open</span><br/>
<span id='54'>The breast of heaven, I did present myself</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Even in the aim and very flash of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?</span><br/>
<span id='57'>It is the part of men to fear and tremble,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>When the most mighty gods by tokens send</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life</span><br/>
<span id='61'>That should be in a Roman you do want,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>To see the strange impatience of the heavens:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>But if you would consider the true cause</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Why old men fool and children calculate,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Why all these things change from their ordinance</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Their natures and preformed faculties</span><br/>
<span id='71'>To monstrous quality,&mdash;why, you shall find</span><br/>
<span id='72'>That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>To make them instruments of fear and warning</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Unto some monstrous state.</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Most like this dreadful night,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars</span><br/>
<span id='78'>As doth the lion in the Capitol,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>A man no mightier than thyself or me</span><br/>
<span id='80'>In personal action, yet prodigious grown</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Let it be who it is: for Romans now</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Mean to establish Caesar as a king;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>In every place, save here in Italy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>I know where I will wear this dagger then;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>But life, being weary of these worldly bars,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Never lacks power to dismiss itself.</span><br/>
<span id='101'>If I know this, know all the world besides,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>That part of tyranny that I do bear</span><br/>
<span id='103'>I can shake off at pleasure.</span><br/>
<p><em>Thunder still</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>So can I:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>So every bondman in his own hand bears</span><br/>
<span id='106'>The power to cancel his captivity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Those that with haste will make a mighty fire</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>What rubbish and what offal, when it serves</span><br/>
<span id='114'>For the base matter to illuminate</span><br/>
<span id='115'>So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Before a willing bondman; then I know</span><br/>
<span id='118'>My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And dangers are to me indifferent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>You speak to Casca, and to such a man</span><br/>
<span id='121'>That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Be factious for redress of all these griefs,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>And I will set this foot of mine as far</span><br/>
<span id='124'>As who goes farthest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>There's a bargain made.</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Now know you, Casca, I have moved already</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans</span><br/>
<span id='128'>To undergo with me an enterprise</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Of honourable-dangerous consequence;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And I do know, by this, they stay for me</span><br/>
<span id='131'>In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>There is no stir or walking in the streets;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And the complexion of the element</span><br/>
<span id='134'>In favour's like the work we have in hand,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;</span><br/>
<span id='138'>He is a friend.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CINNA</em></p>
<span id='139'>Cinna, where haste you so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CINNA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>No, it is Casca; one incorporate</span><br/>
<span id='142'>To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>CINNA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!</span><br/>
<span id='144'>There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Am I not stay'd for? tell me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>CINNA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Yes, you are.</span><br/>
<span id='147'>O Cassius, if you could</span><br/>
<span id='148'>But win the noble Brutus to our party&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this</span><br/>
<span id='152'>In at his window; set this up with wax</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>CINNA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone</span><br/>
<span id='157'>To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>And so bestow these papers as you bade me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit CINNA</em></p>
<span id='160'>Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day</span><br/>
<span id='161'>See Brutus at his house: three parts of him</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Is ours already, and the man entire</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Upon the next encounter yields him ours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:</span><br/>
<span id='165'>And that which would appear offence in us,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>His countenance, like richest alchemy,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Will change to virtue and to worthiness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Him and his worth and our great need of him</span><br/>
<span id='169'>You have right well conceited. Let us go,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>For it is after midnight; and ere day</span><br/>
<span id='171'>We will awake him and be sure of him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

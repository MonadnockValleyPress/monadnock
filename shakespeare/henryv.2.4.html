<h1>Henry V</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>France. The King's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Flourish. Enter the FRENCH KING, the DAUPHIN, the DUKES of BERRI and BRETAGNE, the Constable, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Thus comes the English with full power upon us;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And more than carefully it us concerns</span><br/>
<span id='3'>To answer royally in our defences.</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>To line and new repair our towns of war</span><br/>
<span id='8'>With men of courage and with means defendant;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>For England his approaches makes as fierce</span><br/>
<span id='10'>As waters to the sucking of a gulf.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>It fits us then to be as provident</span><br/>
<span id='12'>As fear may teach us out of late examples</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Left by the fatal and neglected English</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Upon our fields.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>                  My most redoubted father,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>But that defences, musters, preparations,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Should be maintain'd, assembled and collected,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>As were a war in expectation.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To view the sick and feeble parts of France:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And let us do it with no show of fear;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>No, with no more than if we heard that England</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Her sceptre so fantastically borne</span><br/>
<span id='29'>By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>That fear attends her not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>Constable</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>O peace, Prince Dauphin!</span><br/>
<span id='32'>You are too much mistaken in this king:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Question your grace the late ambassadors,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>With what great state he heard their embassy,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>How well supplied with noble counsellors,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>How modest in exception, and withal</span><br/>
<span id='37'>How terrible in constant resolution,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And you shall find his vanities forespent</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Covering discretion with a coat of folly;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots</span><br/>
<span id='42'>That shall first spring and be most delicate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>But though we think it so, it is no matter:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh</span><br/>
<span id='46'>The enemy more mighty than he seems:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>So the proportions of defence are fill'd;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Which of a weak or niggardly projection</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting</span><br/>
<span id='50'>A little cloth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>                  Think we King Harry strong;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And he is bred out of that bloody strain</span><br/>
<span id='55'>That haunted us in our familiar paths:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Witness our too much memorable shame</span><br/>
<span id='57'>When Cressy battle fatally was struck,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And all our princes captiv'd by the hand</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Mangle the work of nature and deface</span><br/>
<span id='64'>The patterns that by God and by French fathers</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Had twenty years been made. This is a stem</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Of that victorious stock; and let us fear</span><br/>
<span id='67'>The native mightiness and fate of him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Ambassadors from Harry King of England</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Do crave admittance to your majesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>We'll give them present audience. Go, and bring them.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Messenger and certain Lords</em></p>
<span id='71'>You see this chase is hotly follow'd, friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Turn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogs</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Take up the English short, and let them know</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Of what a monarchy you are the head:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin</span><br/>
<span id='78'>As self-neglecting.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Lords, with EXETER and train</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>From our brother England?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>EXETER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>From him; and thus he greets your majesty.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>That you divest yourself, and lay apart</span><br/>
<span id='83'>The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>By law of nature and of nations, 'long</span><br/>
<span id='85'>To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And all wide-stretched honours that pertain</span><br/>
<span id='87'>By custom and the ordinance of times</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Unto the crown of France. That you may know</span><br/>
<span id='89'>'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>He sends you this most memorable line,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>In every branch truly demonstrative;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Willing to overlook this pedigree:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And when you find him evenly derived</span><br/>
<span id='96'>From his most famed of famous ancestors,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Edward the Third, he bids you then resign</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held</span><br/>
<span id='99'>From him the native and true challenger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Or else what follows?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>EXETER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>That, if requiring fail, he will compel;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy</span><br/>
<span id='108'>On the poor souls for whom this hungry war</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries</span><br/>
<span id='111'>The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>This is his claim, his threatening and my message;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>To whom expressly I bring greeting too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>For us, we will consider of this further:</span><br/>
<span id='118'>To-morrow shall you bear our full intent</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Back to our brother England.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>For the Dauphin,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>I stand here for him: what to him from England?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>EXETER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>And any thing that may not misbecome</span><br/>
<span id='124'>The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Thus says my king; an' if your father's highness</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Do not, in grant of all demands at large,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>That caves and womby vaultages of France</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Shall chide your trespass and return your mock</span><br/>
<span id='131'>In second accent of his ordnance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Say, if my father render fair return,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>It is against my will; for I desire</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Nothing but odds with England: to that end,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>As matching to his youth and vanity,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>I did present him with the Paris balls.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>EXETER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:</span><br/>
<span id='139'>And, be assured, you'll find a difference,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>As we his subjects have in wonder found,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Between the promise of his greener days</span><br/>
<span id='142'>And these he masters now: now he weighs time</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read</span><br/>
<span id='144'>In your own losses, if he stay in France.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>EXETER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Come here himself to question our delay;</span><br/>
<span id='148'>For he is footed in this land already.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>You shall be soon dispatch's with fair conditions:</span><br/>
<span id='150'>A night is but small breath and little pause</span><br/>
<span id='151'>To answer matters of this consequence.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish. Exeunt</em></p>

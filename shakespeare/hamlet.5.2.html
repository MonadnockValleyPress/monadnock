<h1>Hamlet</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene II</h3>
<h4>A hall in the castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter HAMLET and HORATIO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>You do remember all the circumstance?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Remember it, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>That would not let me sleep: methought I lay</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And praised be rashness for it, let us know,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us</span><br/>
<span id='10'>There's a divinity that shapes our ends,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Rough-hew them how we will,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>That is most certain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Up from my cabin,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Groped I to find out them; had my desire.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew</span><br/>
<span id='17'>To mine own room again; making so bold,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>My fears forgetting manners, to unseal</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>O royal knavery!&mdash;an exact command,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Larded with many several sorts of reasons</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Importing Denmark's health and England's too,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>My head should be struck off.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Is't possible?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>I beseech you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Being thus be-netted round with villanies,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>They had begun the play&mdash;I sat me down,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>I once did hold it, as our statists do,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>A baseness to write fair and labour'd much</span><br/>
<span id='37'>How to forget that learning, but, sir, now</span><br/>
<span id='38'>It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know</span><br/>
<span id='39'>The effect of what I wrote?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Ay, good my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>An earnest conjuration from the king,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>As England was his faithful tributary,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>As love between them like the palm might flourish,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And stand a comma 'tween their amities,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And many such-like as's of great charge,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>That, on the view and knowing of these contents,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Without debatement further, more or less,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>He should the bearers put to sudden death,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Not shriving-time allow'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>How was this seal'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>I had my father's signet in my purse,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Which was the model of that Danish seal;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Folded the writ up in form of the other,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>The changeling never known. Now, the next day</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Thou know'st already.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Why, man, they did make love to this employment;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>They are not near my conscience; their defeat</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Does by their own insinuation grow:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Between the pass and fell incensed points</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Of mighty opposites.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Why, what a king is this!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Thrown out his angle for my proper life,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And with such cozenage&mdash;is't not perfect conscience,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>To let this canker of our nature come</span><br/>
<span id='75'>In further evil?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>It must be shortly known to him from England</span><br/>
<span id='77'>What is the issue of the business there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>It will be short: the interim is mine;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'</span><br/>
<span id='80'>But I am very sorry, good Horatio,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>That to Laertes I forgot myself;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>For, by the image of my cause, I see</span><br/>
<span id='83'>The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Into a towering passion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Peace! who comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter OSRIC</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>No, my good lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to</span><br/>
<span id='91'>know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a</span><br/>
<span id='92'>beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at</span><br/>
<span id='93'>the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>spacious in the possession of dirt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I</span><br/>
<span id='96'>should impart a thing to you from his majesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of</span><br/>
<span id='98'>spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>I thank your lordship, it is very hot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is</span><br/>
<span id='101'>northerly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my</span><br/>
<span id='104'>complexion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,&mdash;as</span><br/>
<span id='106'>'twere,&mdash;I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his</span><br/>
<span id='107'>majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a</span><br/>
<span id='108'>great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>I beseech you, remember&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>HAMLET moves him to put on his hat</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe</span><br/>
<span id='112'>me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent</span><br/>
<span id='113'>differences, of very soft society and great showing:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or</span><br/>
<span id='115'>calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the</span><br/>
<span id='116'>continent of what part a gentleman would see.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>though, I know, to divide him inventorially would</span><br/>
<span id='119'>dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw</span><br/>
<span id='120'>neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the</span><br/>
<span id='121'>verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of</span><br/>
<span id='122'>great article; and his infusion of such dearth and</span><br/>
<span id='123'>rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his</span><br/>
<span id='124'>semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace</span><br/>
<span id='125'>him, his umbrage, nothing more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='128'>in our more rawer breath?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?</span><br/>
<span id='131'>You will do't, sir, really.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>What imports the nomination of this gentleman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Of Laertes?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Of him, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>I know you are not ignorant&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>it would not much approve me. Well, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with</span><br/>
<span id='141'>him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to</span><br/>
<span id='142'>know himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation</span><br/>
<span id='144'>laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>What's his weapon?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Rapier and dagger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>That's two of his weapons: but, well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary</span><br/>
<span id='149'>horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take</span><br/>
<span id='150'>it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their</span><br/>
<span id='151'>assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the</span><br/>
<span id='152'>carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very</span><br/>
<span id='153'>responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>and of very liberal conceit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>What call you the carriages?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>The carriages, sir, are the hangers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we</span><br/>
<span id='159'>could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might</span><br/>
<span id='160'>be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses</span><br/>
<span id='161'>against six French swords, their assigns, and three</span><br/>
<span id='162'>liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet</span><br/>
<span id='163'>against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes</span><br/>
<span id='165'>between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you</span><br/>
<span id='166'>three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it</span><br/>
<span id='167'>would come to immediate trial, if your lordship</span><br/>
<span id='168'>would vouchsafe the answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>How if I answer 'no'?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his</span><br/>
<span id='172'>majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let</span><br/>
<span id='173'>the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the</span><br/>
<span id='174'>king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;</span><br/>
<span id='175'>if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>OSRIC</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>I commend my duty to your lordship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Yours, yours.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit OSRIC</em></p>
<span id='180'>He does well to commend it himself; there are no</span><br/>
<span id='181'>tongues else for's turn.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Thus has he&mdash;and many more of the same bevy that I</span><br/>
<span id='185'>know the dressy age dotes on&mdash;only got the tune of</span><br/>
<span id='186'>the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of</span><br/>
<span id='187'>yesty collection, which carries them through and</span><br/>
<span id='188'>through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do</span><br/>
<span id='189'>but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Lord</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in</span><br/>
<span id='192'>the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to</span><br/>
<span id='193'>play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's</span><br/>
<span id='195'>pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now</span><br/>
<span id='196'>or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>The king and queen and all are coming down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>In happy time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>The queen desires you to use some gentle</span><br/>
<span id='200'>entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>She well instructs me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Lord</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>You will lose this wager, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>I do not think so: since he went into France, I</span><br/>
<span id='204'>have been in continual practise: I shall win at the</span><br/>
<span id='205'>odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here</span><br/>
<span id='206'>about my heart: but it is no matter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='207'>Nay, good my lord,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of</span><br/>
<span id='209'>gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>If your mind dislike anything, obey it: I will</span><br/>
<span id='211'>forestall their repair hither, and say you are not</span><br/>
<span id='212'>fit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='213'>Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special</span><br/>
<span id='214'>providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be</span><br/>
<span id='216'>now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the</span><br/>
<span id='217'>readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he</span><br/>
<span id='218'>leaves, what is't to leave betimes?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils,  &amp;c</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='219'>Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.</span><br/>
<p><em>KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='220'>Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;</span><br/>
<span id='221'>But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.</span><br/>
<span id='222'>This presence knows,</span><br/>
<span id='223'>And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd</span><br/>
<span id='224'>With sore distraction. What I have done,</span><br/>
<span id='225'>That might your nature, honour and exception</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.</span><br/>
<span id='227'>Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:</span><br/>
<span id='228'>If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,</span><br/>
<span id='229'>And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,</span><br/>
<span id='230'>Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,</span><br/>
<span id='232'>Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;</span><br/>
<span id='233'>His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.</span><br/>
<span id='234'>Sir, in this audience,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil</span><br/>
<span id='236'>Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='237'>That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,</span><br/>
<span id='238'>And hurt my brother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<span id='239'>I am satisfied in nature,</span><br/>

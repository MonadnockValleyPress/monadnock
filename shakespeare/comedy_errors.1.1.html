<h1>The Comedy of Errors</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>A hall in Duke Solinus's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>AEGEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And by the doom of death end woes and all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DUKE SOLINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>I am not partial to infringe our laws:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>The enmity and discord which of late</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke</span><br/>
<span id='7'>To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>For, since the mortal and intestine jars</span><br/>
<span id='12'>'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>It hath in solemn synods been decreed</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>To admit no traffic to our adverse towns: Nay, more,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>If any born at Ephesus be seen</span><br/>
<span id='17'>At any Syracusian marts and fairs;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Again: if any Syracusian born</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Unless a thousand marks be levied,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>To quit the penalty and to ransom him.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>AEGEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DUKE SOLINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Why thou departed'st from thy native home</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>AEGEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>A heavier task could not have been imposed</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Yet, that the world may witness that my end</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>In Syracusa was I born, and wed</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Unto a woman, happy but for me,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And by me, had not our hap been bad.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased</span><br/>
<span id='40'>By prosperous voyages I often made</span><br/>
<span id='41'>To Epidamnum; till my factor's death</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And the great care of goods at random left</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>From whom my absence was not six months old</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Before herself, almost at fainting under</span><br/>
<span id='46'>The pleasing punishment that women bear,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Had made provision for her following me</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And soon and safe arrived where I was.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>There had she not been long, but she became</span><br/>
<span id='50'>A joyful mother of two goodly sons;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And, which was strange, the one so like the other,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>As could not be distinguish'd but by names.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>A meaner woman was delivered</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Those,&mdash;for their parents were exceeding poor,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>I bought and brought up to attend my sons.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Made daily motions for our home return:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>We came aboard.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Before the always wind-obeying deep</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>But longer did we not retain much hope;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>For what obscured light the heavens did grant</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Did but convey unto our fearful minds</span><br/>
<span id='68'>A doubtful warrant of immediate death;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Which though myself would gladly have embraced,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Weeping before for what she saw must come,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Forced me to seek delays for them and me.</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And this it was, for other means was none:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Such as seafaring men provide for storms;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>To him one of the other twins was bound,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>The children thus disposed, my wife and I,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Dispersed those vapours that offended us;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And by the benefit of his wished light,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Two ships from far making amain to us,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>But ere they came,&mdash;O, let me say no more!</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Gather the sequel by that went before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DUKE SOLINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>AEGEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>O, had the gods done so, I had not now</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Worthily term'd them merciless to us!</span><br/>
<span id='100'>For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>We were encounterd by a mighty rock;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Which being violently borne upon,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Fortune had left to both of us alike</span><br/>
<span id='106'>What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened</span><br/>
<span id='108'>With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Was carried with more speed before the wind;</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And in our sight they three were taken up</span><br/>
<span id='111'>By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>At length, another ship had seized on us;</span><br/>
<span id='113'>And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DUKE SOLINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Do me the favour to dilate at full</span><br/>
<span id='123'>What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>AEGEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>At eighteen years became inquisitive</span><br/>
<span id='126'>After his brother: and importuned me</span><br/>
<span id='127'>That his attendant&mdash;so his case was like,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Might bear him company in the quest of him:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Or that or any place that harbours men.</span><br/>
<span id='137'>But here must end the story of my life;</span><br/>
<span id='138'>And happy were I in my timely death,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Could all my travels warrant me they live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DUKE SOLINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd</span><br/>
<span id='141'>To bear the extremity of dire mishap!</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Which princes, would they, may not disannul,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>My soul would sue as advocate for thee.</span><br/>
<span id='146'>But, though thou art adjudged to the death</span><br/>
<span id='147'>And passed sentence may not be recall'd</span><br/>
<span id='148'>But to our honour's great disparagement,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Yet I will favour thee in what I can.</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day</span><br/>
<span id='151'>To seek thy life by beneficial help:</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Gaoler, take him to thy custody.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Gaoler</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>I will, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>AEGEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>But to procrastinate his lifeless end.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Friar Laurence's cell.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>My father Capulet will have it so;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>You say you do not know the lady's mind:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Uneven is the course, I like it not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And therefore have I little talk'd of love;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous</span><br/>
<span id='10'>That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>To stop the inundation of her tears;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Which, too much minded by herself alone,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>May be put from her by society:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Now do you know the reason of this haste.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>[Aside]  I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter JULIET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Happily met, my lady and my wife!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>What must be shall be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>That's a certain text.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Come you to make confession to this father?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>To answer that, I should confess to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Do not deny to him that you love me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>I will confess to you that I love him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>If I do so, it will be of more price,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>The tears have got small victory by that;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>For it was bad enough before their spite.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And what I spake, I spake it to my face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>It may be so, for it is not mine own.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Are you at leisure, holy father, now;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Or shall I come to you at evening mass?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>My lord, we must entreat the time alone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>God shield I should disturb devotion!</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>It strains me past the compass of my wits:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>On Thursday next be married to this county.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Do thou but call my resolution wise,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And with this knife I'll help it presently.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Shall be the label to another deed,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Or my true heart with treacherous revolt</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Turn to another, this shall slay them both:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Give me some present counsel, or, behold,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Which the commission of thy years and art</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Could to no issue of true honour bring.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Be not so long to speak; I long to die,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Which craves as desperate an execution.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>As that is desperate which we would prevent.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>If, rather than to marry County Paris,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Then is it likely thou wilt undertake</span><br/>
<span id='75'>A thing like death to chide away this shame,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>That copest with death himself to scape from it:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>From off the battlements of yonder tower;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Or bid me go into a new-made grave</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And I will do it without fear or doubt,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent</span><br/>
<span id='91'>To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Take thou this vial, being then in bed,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And this distilled liquor drink thou off;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>When presently through all thy veins shall run</span><br/>
<span id='97'>A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade</span><br/>
<span id='101'>To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Each part, deprived of supple government,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes</span><br/>
<span id='109'>To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Then, as the manner of our country is,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And hither shall he come: and he and I</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Will watch thy waking, and that very night</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And this shall free thee from this present shame;</span><br/>
<span id='120'>If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Abate thy valour in the acting it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous</span><br/>
<span id='124'>In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed</span><br/>
<span id='125'>To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Farewell, dear father!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

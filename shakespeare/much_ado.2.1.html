<h1>Much Ado About Nothing</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>A hall in Leonato's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Was not Count John here at supper?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>I saw him not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see</span><br/>
<span id='4'>him but I am heart-burned an hour after.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>He is of a very melancholy disposition.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>He were an excellent man that were made just in the</span><br/>
<span id='7'>midway between him and Benedick: the one is too</span><br/>
<span id='8'>like an image and says nothing, and the other too</span><br/>
<span id='9'>like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's</span><br/>
<span id='11'>mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Benedick's face,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money</span><br/>
<span id='14'>enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman</span><br/>
<span id='15'>in the world, if a' could get her good-will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a</span><br/>
<span id='17'>husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>In faith, she's too curst.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's</span><br/>
<span id='20'>sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst</span><br/>
<span id='21'>cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Just, if he send me no husband; for the which</span><br/>
<span id='24'>blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and</span><br/>
<span id='25'>evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a</span><br/>
<span id='26'>beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>You may light on a husband that hath no beard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel</span><br/>
<span id='29'>and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a</span><br/>
<span id='30'>beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no</span><br/>
<span id='31'>beard is less than a man: and he that is more than</span><br/>
<span id='32'>a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a</span><br/>
<span id='33'>man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take</span><br/>
<span id='34'>sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his</span><br/>
<span id='35'>apes into hell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Well, then, go you into hell?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet</span><br/>
<span id='38'>me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and</span><br/>
<span id='39'>say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to</span><br/>
<span id='40'>heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver</span><br/>
<span id='41'>I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the</span><br/>
<span id='42'>heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and</span><br/>
<span id='43'>there live we as merry as the day is long.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>[To HERO]  Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled</span><br/>
<span id='45'>by your father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy</span><br/>
<span id='47'>and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all</span><br/>
<span id='48'>that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else</span><br/>
<span id='49'>make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please</span><br/>
<span id='50'>me.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Not till God make men of some other metal than</span><br/>
<span id='53'>earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be</span><br/>
<span id='54'>overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make</span><br/>
<span id='55'>an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?</span><br/>
<span id='56'>No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince</span><br/>
<span id='59'>do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be</span><br/>
<span id='61'>not wooed in good time: if the prince be too</span><br/>
<span id='62'>important, tell him there is measure in every thing</span><br/>
<span id='63'>and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot</span><br/>
<span id='66'>and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as</span><br/>
<span id='67'>fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a</span><br/>
<span id='68'>measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes</span><br/>
<span id='69'>repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the</span><br/>
<span id='70'>cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.</span><br/>
<p><em>All put on their masks</em></p>
<p><em>Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR, DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others, masked</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Lady, will you walk about with your friend?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>With me in your company?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>I may say so, when I please.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>And when please you to say so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>When I like your favour; for God defend the lute</span><br/>
<span id='81'>should be like the case!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Why, then, your visor should be thatched.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Speak low, if you speak love.</span><br/>
<p><em>Drawing her aside</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BALTHASAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Well, I would you did like me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many</span><br/>
<span id='87'>ill-qualities.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BALTHASAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Which is one?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>I say my prayers aloud.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>BALTHASAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>God match me with a good dancer!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BALTHASAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Amen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is</span><br/>
<span id='94'>done! Answer, clerk.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BALTHASAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>No more words: the clerk is answered.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>URSULA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>At a word, I am not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>URSULA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>I know you by the waggling of your head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>To tell you true, I counterfeit him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>URSULA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were</span><br/>
<span id='101'>the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you</span><br/>
<span id='102'>are he, you are he.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>At a word, I am not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>URSULA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your</span><br/>
<span id='105'>excellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's an</span><br/>
<span id='107'>end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Will you not tell me who told you so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>No, you shall pardon me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Nor will you not tell me who you are?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Not now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit</span><br/>
<span id='113'>out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'&mdash;well this was</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Signior Benedick that said so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>What's he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I am sure you know him well enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Not I, believe me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Did he never make you laugh?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>I pray you, what is he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>none but libertines delight in him; and the</span><br/>
<span id='123'>commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>for he both pleases men and angers them, and then</span><br/>
<span id='125'>they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in</span><br/>
<span id='126'>the fleet: I would he had boarded me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a</span><br/>
<span id='131'>partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no</span><br/>
<span id='132'>supper that night.</span><br/>
<p><em>Music</em></p>
<span id='133'>We must follow the leaders.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>In every good thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at</span><br/>
<span id='136'>the next turning.</span><br/>
<p><em>Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO, and CLAUDIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath</span><br/>
<span id='138'>withdrawn her father to break with him about it.</span><br/>
<span id='139'>The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Are not you Signior Benedick?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>You know me well; I am he.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:</span><br/>
<span id='144'>he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him</span><br/>
<span id='145'>from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may</span><br/>
<span id='146'>do the part of an honest man in it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>How know you he loves her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>I heard him swear his affection.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Come, let us to the banquet.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.</span><br/>
<span id='153'>'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Friendship is constant in all other things</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Save in the office and affairs of love:</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Let every eye negotiate for itself</span><br/>
<span id='158'>And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.</span><br/>
<span id='160'>This is an accident of hourly proof,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter BENEDICK</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Count Claudio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Yea, the same.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Come, will you go with me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Whither?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Even to the next willow, about your own business,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?</span><br/>
<span id='168'>about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or under</span><br/>
<span id='169'>your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear</span><br/>
<span id='170'>it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>I wish him joy of her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they</span><br/>
<span id='173'>sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would</span><br/>
<span id='174'>have served you thus?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>I pray you, leave me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the</span><br/>
<span id='177'>boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>If it will not be, I'll leave you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.</span><br/>
<span id='180'>But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not</span><br/>
<span id='181'>know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go</span><br/>
<span id='182'>under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I</span><br/>
<span id='183'>am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it</span><br/>
<span id='184'>is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice</span><br/>
<span id='185'>that puts the world into her person and so gives me</span><br/>
<span id='186'>out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter DON PEDRO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.</span><br/>
<span id='189'>I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a</span><br/>
<span id='190'>warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>that your grace had got the good will of this young</span><br/>
<span id='192'>lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or</span><br/>
<span id='194'>to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech89'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>To be whipped! What's his fault?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech90'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being</span><br/>
<span id='197'>overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his</span><br/>
<span id='198'>companion, and he steals it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech91'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The</span><br/>
<span id='200'>transgression is in the stealer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech92'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>and the garland too; for the garland he might have</span><br/>
<span id='203'>worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on</span><br/>
<span id='204'>you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech93'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to</span><br/>
<span id='206'>the owner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech94'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='207'>If their singing answer your saying, by my faith,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>you say honestly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech95'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='209'>The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the</span><br/>
<span id='210'>gentleman that danced with her told her she is much</span><br/>
<span id='211'>wronged by you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech96'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='212'>O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!</span><br/>
<span id='213'>an oak but with one green leaf on it would have</span><br/>
<span id='214'>answered her; my very visor began to assume life and</span><br/>
<span id='215'>scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been</span><br/>
<span id='216'>myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was</span><br/>
<span id='217'>duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest</span><br/>
<span id='218'>with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood</span><br/>
<span id='219'>like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at</span><br/>
<span id='220'>me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:</span><br/>
<span id='221'>if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,</span><br/>
<span id='222'>there were no living near her; she would infect to</span><br/>
<span id='223'>the north star. I would not marry her, though she</span><br/>
<span id='224'>were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before</span><br/>
<span id='225'>he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have</span><br/>
<span id='226'>turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make</span><br/>
<span id='227'>the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find</span><br/>
<span id='228'>her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God</span><br/>
<span id='229'>some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while</span><br/>
<span id='230'>she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a</span><br/>
<span id='231'>sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they</span><br/>
<span id='232'>would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror</span><br/>
<span id='233'>and perturbation follows her.</span><br/>

<span id='242'>rather than hold three words' conference with this</span><br/>

<span id='249'>Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave</span><br/>

<span id='252'>therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.</span><br/>

<span id='speech103'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>

<span id='speech104'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='254'>So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I</span><br/>
<span id='255'>should prove the mother of fools. I have brought</span><br/>
<span id='256'>Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech105'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>

<span id='257'>Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?</span><br/>

<span id='speech106'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>

<span id='258'>Not sad, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech107'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>

<span id='259'>How then? sick?</span><br/>

<span id='speech108'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>

<span id='260'>Neither, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech109'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>

<span id='261'>The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor</span><br/>
<span id='262'>well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and</span><br/>
<span id='263'>something of that jealous complexion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech110'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='264'>I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;</span><br/>
<span id='265'>though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is</span><br/>
<span id='266'>false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and</span><br/>
<span id='267'>fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,</span><br/>
<span id='268'>and his good will obtained: name the day of</span><br/>
<span id='269'>marriage, and God give thee joy!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech111'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>

<span id='270'>Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my</span><br/>

<span id='273'>Speak, count, 'tis your cue.</span><br/>

<span id='speech113'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>

<span id='274'>Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were</span><br/>

<span id='278'>Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='280'>In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.</span><br/>

<span id='speech116'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='281'>Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on</span><br/>
<span id='282'>the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his</span><br/>
<span id='283'>ear that he is in her heart.</span><br/>

<span id='speech117'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>

<span id='284'>And so she doth, cousin.</span><br/>

<span id='285'>Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the</span><br/>
<span id='286'>world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a</span><br/>
<span id='287'>corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech119'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>

<span id='288'>Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.</span><br/>

<span id='speech120'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='289'>I would rather have one of your father's getting.</span><br/>
<span id='290'>Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your</span><br/>
<span id='291'>father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech121'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='292'>Will you have me, lady?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech122'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='293'>No, my lord, unless I might have another for</span><br/>
<span id='294'>working-days: your grace is too costly to wear</span><br/>
<span id='295'>every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I</span><br/>
<span id='296'>was born to speak all mirth and no matter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech123'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='297'>Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best</span><br/>
<span id='298'>becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in</span><br/>
<span id='299'>a merry hour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech124'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='300'>No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there</span><br/>
<span id='301'>was a star danced, and under that was I born.</span><br/>
<span id='302'>Cousins, God give you joy!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech125'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='303'>Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?</span><br/>

<span id='305'>By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech128'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='306'>There's little of the melancholy element in her, my</span><br/>
<span id='307'>lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and</span><br/>
<span id='308'>not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,</span><br/>
<span id='309'>she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked</span><br/>
<span id='310'>herself with laughing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech129'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='311'>She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.</span><br/>

<span id='speech130'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>

<span id='speech131'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>

<span id='313'>She were an excellent wife for Benedict.</span><br/>

<span id='314'>O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,</span><br/>
<span id='315'>they would talk themselves mad.</span><br/>

<span id='speech135'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='319'>Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just</span><br/>
<span id='320'>seven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have all</span><br/>
<span id='321'>things answer my mind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech136'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='322'>Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:</span><br/>
<span id='323'>but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go</span><br/>
<span id='324'>dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of</span><br/>
<span id='325'>Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior</span><br/>
<span id='326'>Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of</span><br/>
<span id='327'>affection the one with the other. I would fain have</span><br/>
<span id='328'>it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if</span><br/>
<span id='329'>you three will but minister such assistance as I</span><br/>
<span id='330'>shall give you direction.</span><br/>

<span id='speech137'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>

<span id='333'>And I, my lord.</span><br/>

<span id='334'>And you too, gentle Hero?</span><br/>

<span id='speech140'><strong>HERO</strong></span>

<span id='335'>I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my</span><br/>
<span id='336'>cousin to a good husband.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech141'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='337'>And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that</span><br/>
<span id='338'>I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble</span><br/>
<span id='339'>strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I</span><br/>
<span id='340'>will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she</span><br/>
<span id='341'>shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your</span><br/>
<span id='342'>two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in</span><br/>
<span id='343'>despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he</span><br/>
<span id='344'>shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,</span><br/>
<span id='345'>Cupid is no longer an archer: hi s glory shall be</span><br/>
<span id='346'>ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,</span><br/>

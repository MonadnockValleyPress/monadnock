<h3>CII</h3>
<p>
My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;<br/>
I love not less, though less the show appear;<br/>
That love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,<br/>
The owner's tongue doth publish every where.<br/>
Our love was new, and then but in the spring,<br/>
When I was wont to greet it with my lays;<br/>
As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,<br/>
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:<br/>
Not that the summer is less pleasant now<br/>
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,<br/>
But that wild music burthens every bough,<br/>
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I would not dull you with my song.<br/>

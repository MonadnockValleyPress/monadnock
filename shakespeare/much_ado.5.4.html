<h1>Much Ado About Nothing</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>A room in Leonato's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, BENEDICK, BEATRICE, MARGARET, URSULA, FRIAR FRANCIS, and HERO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Did I not tell you she was innocent?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>So are the prince and Claudio, who accused her</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Upon the error that you heard debated:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>But Margaret was in some fault for this,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Although against her will, as it appears</span><br/>
<span id='6'>In the true course of all the question.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>And so am I, being else by faith enforced</span><br/>
<span id='9'>To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Well, daughter, and you gentle-women all,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Ladies</em></p>
<span id='13'>The prince and Claudio promised by this hour</span><br/>
<span id='14'>To visit me. You know your office, brother:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>You must be father to your brother's daughter</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And give her to young Claudio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>To do what, signior?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>To bind me, or undo me; one of them.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>And I do with an eye of love requite her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>The sight whereof I think you had from me,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>But, for my will, my will is your good will</span><br/>
<span id='29'>May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd</span><br/>
<span id='30'>In the state of honourable marriage:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>My heart is with your liking.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>And my help.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Here comes the prince and Claudio.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO, and two or three others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Good morrow to this fair assembly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>We here attend you. Are you yet determined</span><br/>
<span id='38'>To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Call her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit ANTONIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>That you have such a February face,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>I think he thinks upon the savage bull.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>As once Europa did at lusty Jove,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>When he would play the noble beast in love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And got a calf in that same noble feat</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter ANTONIO, with the Ladies masked</em></p>
<span id='54'>Which is the lady I must seize upon?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>This same is she, and I do give you her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>No, that you shall not, till you take her hand</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Before this friar and swear to marry her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Give me your hand: before this holy friar,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>I am your husband, if you like of me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>And when I lived, I was your other wife:</span><br/>
<p><em>Unmasking</em></p>
<span id='62'>And when you loved, you were my other husband.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Another Hero!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>                  Nothing certainer:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>One Hero died defiled, but I do live,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And surely as I live, I am a maid.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>The former Hero! Hero that is dead!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>All this amazement can I qualify:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>When after that the holy rites are ended,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Meantime let wonder seem familiar,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And to the chapel let us presently.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>[Unmasking]  I answer to that name. What is your will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Do not you love me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Why, no; no more than reason.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Have been deceived; they swore you did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Do not you love me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Troth, no; no more than reason.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>They swore that you were almost sick for me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>No, truly, but in friendly recompense.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>For here's a paper written in his hand,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Fashion'd to Beatrice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>And here's another</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Containing her affection unto Benedick.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take</span><br/>
<span id='98'>thee for pity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield</span><br/>
<span id='100'>upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>for I was told you were in a consumption.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Peace! I will stop your mouth.</span><br/>
<p><em>Kissing her</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>I'll tell thee what, prince; a college of</span><br/>
<span id='105'>wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost</span><br/>
<span id='106'>thou think I  care for a satire or an epigram? No:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear</span><br/>
<span id='108'>nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do</span><br/>
<span id='109'>purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any</span><br/>
<span id='110'>purpose that the world can say against it; and</span><br/>
<span id='111'>therefore never flout at me for what I have said</span><br/>
<span id='112'>against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my</span><br/>
<span id='113'>conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to</span><br/>
<span id='114'>have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my</span><br/>
<span id='115'>kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single</span><br/>
<span id='118'>life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of</span><br/>
<span id='119'>question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look</span><br/>
<span id='120'>exceedingly narrowly to thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere</span><br/>
<span id='122'>we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts</span><br/>
<span id='123'>and our wives' heels.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>We'll have dancing afterward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife:</span><br/>
<span id='127'>there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And brought with armed men back to Messina.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Think not on him till to-morrow:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Strike up, pipers.</span><br/>
<p><em>Dance</em></p>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<em>Enter GOWER</em>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GOWER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>To sing a song that old was sung,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>From ashes ancient Gower is come;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Assuming man's infirmities,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To glad your ear, and please your eyes.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>It hath been sung at festivals,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>On ember-eves and holy-ales;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And lords and ladies in their lives</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Have read it for restoratives:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>The purchase is to make men glorious;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>If you, born in these latter times,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>When wit's more ripe, accept my rhymes.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And that to hear an old man sing</span><br/>
<span id='14'>May to your wishes pleasure bring</span><br/>
<span id='15'>I life would wish, and that I might</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Waste it for you, like taper-light.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>The fairest in all Syria,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>I tell you what mine authors say:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>This king unto him took a fere,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Who died and left a female heir,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>So buxom, blithe, and full of face,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>As heaven had lent her all his grace;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>With whom the father liking took,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And her to incest did provoke:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Bad child; worse father! to entice his own</span><br/>
<span id='28'>To evil should be done by none:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>But custom what they did begin</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Was with long use account no sin.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>The beauty of this sinful dame</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Made many princes thither frame,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>To seek her as a bed-fellow,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Which to prevent he made a law,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>To keep her still, and men in awe,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>That whoso ask'd her for his wife,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>His riddle told not, lost his life:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>So for her many a wight did die,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>As yon grim looks do testify.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye</span><br/>
<span id='42'>I give, my cause who best can justify.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

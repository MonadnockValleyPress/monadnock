<h1>Hamlet</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>A hall in the castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter HAMLET and Players</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to</span><br/>
<span id='2'>you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>as many of your players do, I had as lief the</span><br/>
<span id='4'>town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air</span><br/>
<span id='5'>too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget</span><br/>
<span id='8'>a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it</span><br/>
<span id='9'>offends me to the soul to hear a robustious</span><br/>
<span id='10'>periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to</span><br/>
<span id='11'>very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who</span><br/>
<span id='12'>for the most part are capable of nothing but</span><br/>
<span id='13'>inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such</span><br/>
<span id='14'>a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it</span><br/>
<span id='15'>out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Player</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>I warrant your honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion</span><br/>
<span id='18'>be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the</span><br/>
<span id='19'>word to the action; with this special o'erstep not</span><br/>
<span id='20'>the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is</span><br/>
<span id='21'>from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the</span><br/>
<span id='22'>first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the</span><br/>
<span id='23'>mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>scorn her own image, and the very age and body of</span><br/>
<span id='25'>the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful</span><br/>
<span id='27'>laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the</span><br/>
<span id='28'>censure of the which one must in your allowance</span><br/>
<span id='29'>o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be</span><br/>
<span id='30'>players that I have seen play, and heard others</span><br/>
<span id='31'>praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>that, neither having the accent of Christians nor</span><br/>
<span id='33'>the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so</span><br/>
<span id='34'>strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of</span><br/>
<span id='35'>nature's journeymen had made men and not made them</span><br/>
<span id='36'>well, they imitated humanity so abominably.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Player</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>O, reform it altogether. And let those that play</span><br/>
<span id='40'>your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to</span><br/>
<span id='42'>set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh</span><br/>
<span id='43'>too; though, in the mean time, some necessary</span><br/>
<span id='44'>question of the play be then to be considered:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition</span><br/>
<span id='46'>in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Players</em></p>
<p><em>Enter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN</em></p>
<span id='47'>How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>And the queen too, and that presently.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Bid the players make haste.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit POLONIUS</em></p>
<span id='50'>Will you two help to hasten them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong></span>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>We will, my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>What ho! Horatio!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HORATIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Here, sweet lord, at your service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man</span><br/>
<span id='55'>As e'er my conversation coped withal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>O, my dear lord,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>                  Nay, do not think I flatter;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>For what advancement may I hope from thee</span><br/>
<span id='59'>That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?</span><br/>
<span id='61'>No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And could of men distinguish, her election</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been</span><br/>
<span id='67'>As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>A man that fortune's buffets and rewards</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger</span><br/>
<span id='72'>To sound what stop she please. Give me that man</span><br/>
<span id='73'>That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him</span><br/>
<span id='74'>In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>As I do thee.&mdash;Something too much of this.&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>There is a play to-night before the king;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>One scene of it comes near the circumstance</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Which I have told thee of my father's death:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Even with the very comment of thy soul</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Do not itself unkennel in one speech,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>It is a damned ghost that we have seen,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And my imaginations are as foul</span><br/>
<span id='85'>As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And after we will both our judgments join</span><br/>
<span id='88'>In censure of his seeming.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Well, my lord:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>They are coming to the play; I must be idle:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Get you a place.</span><br/>
<p><em>Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS,  QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>How fares our cousin Hamlet?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat</span><br/>
<span id='96'>the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words</span><br/>
<span id='98'>are not mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>No, nor mine now.</span><br/>
<p><em>To POLONIUS</em></p>
<span id='100'>My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>What did you enact?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Capitol; Brutus killed me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf</span><br/>
<span id='106'>there. Be the players ready?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>[To KING CLAUDIUS]  O, ho! do you mark that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Lady, shall I lie in your lap?</span><br/>
<p><em>Lying down at OPHELIA's feet</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>No, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>I mean, my head upon your lap?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Ay, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Do you think I meant country matters?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I think nothing, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>What is, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>

<span id='120'>You are merry, my lord.</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Ay, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do</span><br/>
<span id='124'>but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my</span><br/>
<span id='125'>mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for</span><br/>
<span id='128'>I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two</span><br/>
<span id='129'>months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's</span><br/>
<span id='130'>hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half</span><br/>
<span id='131'>a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with</span><br/>

He takes her up,  and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down  upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep,  leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his  crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's  ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King  dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner,  with some two or three Mutes, comes in again,  seeming to lament with her. The dead body is  carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with  gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love</em></p>

<span id='156'>   So many journeys may the sun and moon</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Make us again count o'er ere love be done!</span><br/>
<span id='158'>But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>So far from cheer and from your former state,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:</span><br/>

<span id='186'>Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;</span><br/>
<span id='187'>But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Most necessary 'tis that we forget</span><br/>

<span id='195'>Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.</span><br/>
<span id='196'>This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange</span><br/>
<span id='197'>That even our loves should with our fortunes change;</span><br/>
<span id='198'>For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.</span><br/>
<span id='200'>The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;</span><br/>

<h1>The Phoenix and the Turtle</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<p>[The "turtle" is the turtledove.&mdash;Ed.]</p>
<p>
Let the bird of loudest lay,<br/>
On the sole Arabian tree,<br/>
Herald sad and trumpet be,<br/>
To whose sound chaste wings obey.
</p>
<p>
But thou shrieking harbinger,<br/>
Foul precurrer of the fiend,<br/>
Augur of the fever's end,<br/>
To this troop come thou not near.
</p>
<p>
From this session interdict<br/>
Every fowl of tyrant wing,<br/>
Save the eagle, feather'd king;<br/>
Keep the obsequy so strict.
</p>
<p>
Let the priest in surplice white,<br/>
That defunctive music can,<br/>
Be the death-divining swan,<br/>
Lest the requiem lack his right.
</p>
<p>
And thou treble-dated crow,<br/>
That thy sable gender mak'st<br/>
With the breath thou giv'st and tak'st,<br/>
'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.
</p>
<p>
Here the anthem doth commence:<br/>
Love and constancy is dead;<br/>
Phoenix and the turtle fled<br/>
In a mutual flame from hence.
</p>
<p>
So they lov'd, as love in twain<br/>
Had the essence but in one;<br/>
Two distincts, division none:<br/>
Number there in love was slain.
</p>
<p>
Hearts remote, yet not asunder;<br/>
Distance and no space was seen<br/>
'Twixt this turtle and his queen;<br/>
But in them it were a wonder.
</p>
<p>
So between them love did shine,<br/>
That the turtle saw his right<br/>
Flaming in the phoenix' sight;<br/>
Either was the other's mine.
</p>
<p>
Property was thus appalled,<br/>
That the self was not the same;<br/>
Single nature's double name<br/>
Neither two nor one was called.
</p>
<p>
Reason, in itself confounded,<br/>
Saw division grow together;<br/>
To themselves yet either neither,<br/>
Simple were so well compounded.
</p>
<p>
That it cried, How true a twain<br/>
Seemeth this concordant one!<br/>
Love hath reason, reason none,<br/>
If what parts can so remain.
</p>
<p>
Whereupon it made this threne<br/>
To the phoenix and the dove,<br/>
Co-supremes and stars of love,<br/>
As chorus to their tragic scene.
</p>
<h3>THRENOS</h3>
<p>
Beauty, truth, and rarity.<br/>
Grace in all simplicity,<br/>
Here enclos'd in cinders lie.
</p>
<p>
Death is now the phoenix' nest;<br/>
And the turtle's loyal breast<br/>
To eternity doth rest.
</p>
<p>
Leaving no posterity:&mdash;<br/>
'Twas not their infirmity,<br/>
It was married chastity.
</p>
<p>
Truth may seem, but cannot be;<br/>
Beauty brag, but 'tis not she;<br/>
Truth and beauty buried be.
</p>
<p>
To this urn let those repair<br/>
That are either true or fair;<br/>
For these dead birds sigh a prayer.

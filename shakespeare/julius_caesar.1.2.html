<h1>Julius Caesar</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</H3>
<h4>A public place.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course;  CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,  CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among them a Soothsayer</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CAESAR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Calpurnia!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>         Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>CAESAR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Calpurnia!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CALPURNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Here, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CAESAR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Stand you directly in Antonius' way,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>When he doth run his course. Antonius!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ANTONY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Caesar, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CAESAR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>The barren, touched in this holy chase,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Shake off their sterile curse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ANTONY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>I shall remember:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CAESAR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Set on; and leave no ceremony out.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Soothsayer</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Caesar!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CAESAR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Ha! who calls?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CAESAR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Who is it in the press that calls on me?</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Soothsayer</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Beware the ides of March.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CAESAR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>What man is that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CAESAR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Set him before me; let me see his face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CAESAR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Soothsayer</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Beware the ides of March.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CAESAR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.</span><br/>
<p><em>Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Will you go see the order of the course?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Not I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>I pray you, do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I am not gamesome: I do lack some part</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>I'll leave you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Brutus, I do observe you now of late:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>I have not from your eyes that gentleness</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And show of love as I was wont to have:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Over your friend that loves you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Cassius,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>I turn the trouble of my countenance</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Of late with passions of some difference,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Conceptions only proper to myself,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Among which number, Cassius, be you one&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Nor construe any further my neglect,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Forgets the shows of love to other men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>But by reflection, by some other things.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>'Tis just:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>That you have no such mirrors as will turn</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>That you might see your shadow. I have heard,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Where many of the best respect in Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And groaning underneath this age's yoke,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>That you would have me seek into myself</span><br/>
<span id='70'>For that which is not in me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And since you know you cannot see yourself</span><br/>
<span id='73'>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Will modestly discover to yourself</span><br/>
<span id='75'>That of yourself which you yet know not of.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Were I a common laugher, or did use</span><br/>
<span id='78'>To stale with ordinary oaths my love</span><br/>
<span id='79'>To every new protester; if you know</span><br/>
<span id='80'>That I do fawn on men and hug them hard</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And after scandal them, or if you know</span><br/>
<span id='82'>That I profess myself in banqueting</span><br/>
<span id='83'>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish, and shout</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>What means this shouting? I do fear, the people</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Choose Caesar for their king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Ay, do you fear it?</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Then must I think you would not have it so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</span><br/>
<span id='90'>What is it that you would impart to me?</span><br/>
<span id='91'>If it be aught toward the general good,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And I will look on both indifferently,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>For let the gods so speed me as I love</span><br/>
<span id='95'>The name of honour more than I fear death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>As well as I do know your outward favour.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Well, honour is the subject of my story.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>I cannot tell what you and other men</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Think of this life; but, for my single self,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>I had as lief not be as live to be</span><br/>
<span id='102'>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</span><br/>
<span id='103'>I was born free as Caesar; so were you:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>We both have fed as well, and we can both</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Endure the winter's cold as well as he:</span><br/>
<span id='106'>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Leap in with me into this angry flood,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</span><br/>
<span id='113'>The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it</span><br/>
<span id='114'>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And stemming it with hearts of controversy;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'</span><br/>
<span id='118'>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</span><br/>
<span id='120'>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</span><br/>
<span id='123'>A wretched creature and must bend his body,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</span><br/>
<span id='125'>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>And when the fit was on him, I did mark</span><br/>
<span id='127'>How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;</span><br/>
<span id='128'>His coward lips did from their colour fly,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'</span><br/>
<span id='134'>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</span><br/>
<span id='135'>A man of such a feeble temper should</span><br/>
<span id='136'>So get the start of the majestic world</span><br/>
<span id='137'>And bear the palm alone.</span><br/>
<p><em>Shout. Flourish</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Another general shout!</span><br/>
<span id='139'>I do believe that these applauses are</span><br/>
<span id='140'>For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Like a Colossus, and we petty men</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Walk under his huge legs and peep about</span><br/>
<span id='144'>To find ourselves dishonourable graves.</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Men at some time are masters of their fates:</span><br/>
<span id='146'>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</span><br/>
<span id='158'>When went there by an age, since the great flood,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>But it was famed with more than with one man?</span><br/>
<span id='160'>When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>When there is in it but one only man.</span><br/>
<span id='164'>O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd</span><br/>
<span id='166'>The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</span><br/>
<span id='167'>As easily as a king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>What you would work me to, I have some aim:</span><br/>
<span id='170'>How I have thought of this and of these times,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>I shall recount hereafter; for this present,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>I would not, so with love I might entreat you,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Be any further moved. What you have said</span><br/>
<span id='174'>I will consider; what you have to say</span><br/>
<span id='175'>I will with patience hear, and find a time</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Both meet to hear and answer such high things.</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Brutus had rather be a villager</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Than to repute himself a son of Rome</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Under these hard conditions as this time</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Is like to lay upon us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>I am glad that my weak words</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>The games are done and Caesar is returning.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;</span><br/>
<span id='186'>And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you</span><br/>
<span id='187'>What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter CAESAR and his Train</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>And all the rest look like a chidden train:</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes</span><br/>
<span id='193'>As we have seen him in the Capitol,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Being cross'd in conference by some senators.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>Casca will tell us what the matter is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>CAESAR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>Antonius!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>ANTONY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>Caesar?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CAESAR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>Let me have men about me that are fat;</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;</span><br/>
<span id='201'>He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ANTONY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;</span><br/>
<span id='203'>He is a noble Roman and well given.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CAESAR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Yet if my name were liable to fear,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>I do not know the man I should avoid</span><br/>
<span id='207'>So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;</span><br/>
<span id='208'>He is a great observer and he looks</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort</span><br/>
<span id='212'>As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit</span><br/>
<span id='213'>That could be moved to smile at any thing.</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Such men as he be never at heart's ease</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>And therefore are they very dangerous.</span><br/>
<span id='217'>I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd</span><br/>
<span id='218'>Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,</span><br/>
<span id='220'>And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA</em></p>

<span id='speech50'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>

<span id='222'>Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,</span><br/>
<span id='223'>That Caesar looks so sad.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>

<span id='224'>Why, you were with him, were you not?</span><br/>

<span id='speech53'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='225'>I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='226'>Why, there was a crown offered him: and being</span><br/>
<span id='227'>offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,</span><br/>
<span id='228'>thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='229'>What was the second noise for?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='230'>Why, for that too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='231'>They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='232'>Why, for that too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='233'>Was the crown offered him thrice?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='234'>Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every</span><br/>
<span id='235'>time gentler than other, and at every putting-by</span><br/>
<span id='236'>mine honest neighbours shouted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='237'>Who offered him the crown?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='238'>Why, Antony.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='239'>Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='240'>I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:</span><br/>
<span id='241'>it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark</span><br/>
<span id='242'>Antony offer him a crown;&mdash;yet 'twas not a crown</span><br/>
<span id='243'>neither, 'twas one of these coronets;&mdash;and, as I told</span><br/>
<span id='244'>you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my</span><br/>
<span id='245'>thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he</span><br/>
<span id='246'>offered it to him again; then he put it by again:</span><br/>
<span id='247'>but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his</span><br/>
<span id='248'>fingers off it. And then he offered it the third</span><br/>
<span id='249'>time; he put it the third time by: and still as he</span><br/>
<span id='250'>refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their</span><br/>
<span id='251'>chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps</span><br/>
<span id='252'>and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because</span><br/>
<span id='253'>Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked</span><br/>
<span id='254'>Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and</span><br/>
<span id='255'>for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of</span><br/>
<span id='256'>opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='257'>But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='258'>He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at</span><br/>
<span id='259'>mouth, and was speechless.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='260'>'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='261'>No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,</span><br/>
<span id='262'>And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='263'>I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,</span><br/>
<span id='264'>Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not</span><br/>
<span id='265'>clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and</span><br/>
<span id='266'>displeased them, as they use to do the players in</span><br/>
<span id='267'>the theatre, I am no true man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='268'>What said he when he came unto himself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='269'>Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the</span><br/>
<span id='270'>common herd was glad he refused the crown, he</span><br/>
<span id='271'>plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his</span><br/>
<span id='272'>throat to cut. An I had been a man of any</span><br/>
<span id='273'>occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,</span><br/>
<span id='274'>I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so</span><br/>
<span id='275'>he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,</span><br/>
<span id='276'>If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired</span><br/>
<span id='277'>their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three</span><br/>
<span id='278'>or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good</span><br/>
<span id='279'>soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but</span><br/>
<span id='280'>there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had</span><br/>
<span id='281'>stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='282'>And after that, he came, thus sad, away?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='283'>Ay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='284'>Did Cicero say any thing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='285'>Ay, he spoke Greek.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='286'>To what effect?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='287'>Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the</span><br/>
<span id='288'>face again: but those that understood him smiled at</span><br/>
<span id='289'>one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own</span><br/>
<span id='290'>part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more</span><br/>
<span id='291'>news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs</span><br/>
<span id='292'>off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you</span><br/>
<span id='293'>well. There was more foolery yet, if I could</span><br/>
<span id='294'>remember it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='295'>Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='296'>No, I am promised forth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='297'>Will you dine with me to-morrow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='298'>Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner</span><br/>
<span id='299'>worth the eating.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='300'>Good: I will expect you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>CASCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='301'>Do so. Farewell, both.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='302'>What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!</span><br/>
<span id='303'>He was quick mettle when he went to school.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='304'>So is he now in execution</span><br/>
<span id='305'>Of any bold or noble enterprise,</span><br/>
<span id='306'>However he puts on this tardy form.</span><br/>
<span id='307'>This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,</span><br/>
<span id='308'>Which gives men stomach to digest his words</span><br/>
<span id='309'>With better appetite.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='310'>And so it is. For this time I will leave you:</span><br/>
<span id='311'>To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,</span><br/>
<span id='312'>I will come home to you; or, if you will,</span><br/>
<span id='313'>Come home to me, and I will wait for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='314'>I will do so: till then, think of the world.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit BRUTUS</em></p>
<span id='315'>Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,</span><br/>
<span id='316'>Thy honourable metal may be wrought</span><br/>
<span id='317'>From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet</span><br/>
<span id='318'>That noble minds keep ever with their likes;</span><br/>
<span id='319'>For who so firm that cannot be seduced?</span><br/>
<span id='320'>Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:</span><br/>
<span id='321'>If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,</span><br/>
<span id='322'>He should not humour me. I will this night,</span><br/>
<span id='323'>In several hands, in at his windows throw,</span><br/>
<span id='324'>As if they came from several citizens,</span><br/>
<span id='325'>Writings all tending to the great opinion</span><br/>
<span id='326'>That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely</span><br/>
<span id='327'>Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:</span><br/>
<span id='328'>And after this let Caesar seat him sure;</span><br/>
<span id='329'>For we will shake him, or worse days endure.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

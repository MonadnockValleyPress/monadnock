<h3>CXX</h3>
<p>
That you were once unkind befriends me now,<br/>
And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,<br/>
Needs must I under my transgression bow,<br/>
Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.<br/>
For if you were by my unkindness shaken,<br/>
As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time;<br/>
And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken<br/>
To weigh how once I suffer'd in your crime.<br/>
O! that our night of woe might have remember'd<br/>
My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,<br/>
And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd<br/>
The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that your trespass now becomes a fee;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.<br/>

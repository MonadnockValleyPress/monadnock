<h1>King Lear</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Another part of the heath. Storm still.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING LEAR and Fool</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!</span><br/>
<span id='2'>You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!</span><br/>
<span id='4'>You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world!</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Crack nature's moulds, an germens spill at once,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>That make ingrateful man!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>O nuncle, court holy-water in a dry</span><br/>
<span id='11'>house is better than this rain-water out o' door.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters' blessing:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>You owe me no subscription: then let fall</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Your horrible pleasure: here I stand, your slave,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>But yet I call you servile ministers,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>That have with two pernicious daughters join'd</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Your high engender'd battles 'gainst a head</span><br/>
<span id='24'>So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>He that has a house to put's head in has a good</span><br/>
<span id='26'>head-piece.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>The cod-piece that will house</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Before the head has any,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>The head and he shall louse;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>So beggars marry many.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>The man that makes his toe</span><br/>
<span id='32'>What he his heart should make</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Shall of a corn cry woe,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And turn his sleep to wake.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>For there was never yet fair woman but she made</span><br/>
<span id='36'>mouths in a glass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>No, I will be the pattern of all patience;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>I will say nothing.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter KENT</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Who's there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Marry, here's grace and a cod-piece; that's a wise</span><br/>
<span id='41'>man and a fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Alas, sir, are you here? things that love night</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And make them keep their caves: since I was man,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Remember to have heard: man's nature cannot carry</span><br/>
<span id='49'>The affliction nor the fear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Let the great gods,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>That hast within thee undivulged crimes,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Thou perjured, and thou simular man of virtue</span><br/>
<span id='56'>That art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>That under covert and convenient seeming</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Hast practised on man's life: close pent-up guilts,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Rive your concealing continents, and cry</span><br/>
<span id='60'>These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man</span><br/>
<span id='61'>More sinn'd against than sinning.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Alack, bare-headed!</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Repose you there; while I to this hard house&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Which even but now, demanding after you,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Denied me to come in&mdash;return, and force</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Their scanted courtesy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>My wits begin to turn.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Come on, my boy: how dost, my boy? art cold?</span><br/>
<span id='72'>I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?</span><br/>
<span id='73'>The art of our necessities is strange,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>That can make vile things precious. Come,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>your hovel.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart</span><br/>
<span id='77'>That's sorry yet for thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>[Singing]</span><br/>
<span id='79'>He that has and a little tiny wit&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Must make content with his fortunes fit,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>For the rain it raineth every day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt KING LEAR and KENT</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>When priests are more in word than matter;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>When brewers mar their malt with water;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>When nobles are their tailors' tutors;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>When every case in law is right;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>When slanders do not live in tongues;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>When usurers tell their gold i' the field;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And bawds and whores do churches build;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Then shall the realm of Albion</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Come to great confusion:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Then comes the time, who lives to see't,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>That going shall be used with feet.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

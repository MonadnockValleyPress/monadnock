<span id='1'>What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-</span><br/>
<span id='2'>time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Let me see.</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='4'>'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him</span><br/>
<span id='6'>not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more</span><br/>
<span id='7'>am I; go to then, there's sympathy: you are merry,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>so am I; ha, ha! then there's more sympathy: you</span><br/>
<span id='9'>love sack, and so do I; would you desire better</span><br/>
<span id='10'>sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,&mdash;at</span><br/>
<span id='11'>the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>that I love thee. I will not say, pity me; 'tis</span><br/>
<span id='13'>not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Thine own true knight,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>By day or night,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Or any kind of light,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>With all his might</span><br/>
<span id='18'>For thee to fight,    JOHN FALSTAFF'</span><br/>
<span id='19'>What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked</span><br/>
<span id='20'>world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with</span><br/>
<span id='21'>age to show himself a young gallant! What an</span><br/>
<span id='22'>unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard</span><br/>
<span id='23'>picked&mdash;with the devil's name!&mdash;out of my</span><br/>
<span id='24'>conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What</span><br/>
<span id='26'>should I say to him? I was then frugal of my</span><br/>
<span id='27'>mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill</span><br/>
<span id='28'>in the parliament for the putting down of men. How</span><br/>
<span id='29'>shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>as sure as his guts are made of puddings.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MISTRESS FORD</em></p>

<span id='31'>Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very</span><br/>
<span id='33'>ill.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>

<span id='35'>Faith, but you do, in my mind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Well, I do then; yet I say I could show you to the</span><br/>
<span id='37'>contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>What's the matter, woman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I</span><br/>
<span id='40'>could come to such honour!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Hang the trifle, woman! take the honour. What is</span><br/>
<span id='42'>it? dispense with trifles; what is it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>I could be knighted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights</span><br/>
<span id='46'>will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the</span><br/>
<span id='47'>article of thy gentry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>We burn daylight: here, read, read; perceive how I</span><br/>
<span id='49'>might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat</span><br/>
<span id='50'>men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of</span><br/>
<span id='51'>men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised</span><br/>
<span id='52'>women's modesty; and gave such orderly and</span><br/>
<span id='53'>well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I</span><br/>
<span id='54'>would have sworn his disposition would have gone to</span><br/>
<span id='55'>the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere</span><br/>
<span id='56'>and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to</span><br/>
<span id='57'>the tune of 'Green Sleeves.' What tempest, I trow,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his</span><br/>
<span id='59'>belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged</span><br/>
<span id='60'>on him? I think the best way were to entertain him</span><br/>
<span id='61'>with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted</span><br/>
<span id='62'>him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery</span><br/>
<span id='65'>of ill opinions, here's the twin-brother of thy</span><br/>
<span id='66'>letter: but let thine inherit first; for, I</span><br/>
<span id='67'>protest, mine never shall. I warrant he hath a</span><br/>
<span id='68'>thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for</span><br/>
<span id='69'>different names&mdash;sure, more,&mdash;and these are of the</span><br/>
<span id='70'>second edition: he will print them, out of doubt;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>for he cares not what he puts into the press, when</span><br/>
<span id='72'>he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you</span><br/>
<span id='74'>twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the very</span><br/>
<span id='76'>words. What doth he think of us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Nay, I know not: it makes me almost ready to</span><br/>
<span id='78'>wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain</span><br/>
<span id='79'>myself like one that I am not acquainted withal;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I</span><br/>
<span id='81'>know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>'Boarding,' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him</span><br/>
<span id='83'>above deck.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>So will I	if he come under my hatches, I'll never</span><br/>
<span id='85'>to sea again. Let's be revenged on him: let's</span><br/>
<span id='86'>appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in</span><br/>
<span id='87'>his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Nay, I will consent to act any villany against him,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>that my husband saw this letter! it would give</span><br/>
<span id='92'>eternal food to his jealousy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Why, look where he comes; and my good man too: he's</span><br/>
<span id='94'>as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>

<span id='96'>You are the happier woman.</span><br/>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>

<span id='99'>Well, I hope it be not so.</span><br/>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Sir John affects thy wife.</span><br/>

<span id='102'>Why, sir, my wife is not young.</span><br/>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>

<span id='103'>He wooes both high and low, both rich and poor,</span><br/>

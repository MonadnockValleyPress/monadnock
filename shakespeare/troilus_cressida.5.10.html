<h1>Troilus and Cressida</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene X</h3>
<h4>Another part of the plains.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter AENEAS and Trojans</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>AENEAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Stand, ho! yet are we masters of the field:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Never go home; here starve we out the night.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter TROILUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Hector is slain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ALL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>                  Hector! the gods forbid!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>He's dead; and at the murderer's horse's tail,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>In beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!</span><br/>
<span id='9'>I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And linger not our sure destructions on!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>AENEAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>My lord, you do discomfort all the host!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>You understand me not that tell me so:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>But dare all imminence that gods and men</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>There is a word will Priam turn to stone;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Hector is dead; there is no more to say.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Let Titan rise as early as he dare,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>I'll through and through you! and, thou great-sized coward,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt AENEAS and Trojans</em></p>
<p><em>As TROILUS is going out, enter, from the other side, PANDARUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>But hear you, hear you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Hence, broker-lackey! ignomy and shame</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>A goodly medicine for my aching bones! O world!</span><br/>
<span id='37'>world! world! thus is the poor agent despised!</span><br/>
<span id='38'>O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set</span><br/>
<span id='39'>a-work, and how ill requited! why should our</span><br/>
<span id='40'>endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed?</span><br/>
<span id='41'>what verse for it? what instance for it? Let me see:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And being once subdued in armed tail,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Good traders in the flesh, set this in your</span><br/>
<span id='47'>painted cloths.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>As many as be here of pander's hall,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Some two months hence my will shall here be made:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>It should be now, but that my fear is this,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And at that time bequeathe you my diseases.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

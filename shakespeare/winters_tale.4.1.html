<h1>Winter's Tale</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Chorus</h4>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter Time, the Chorus</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Time</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Now take upon me, in the name of Time,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To use my wings. Impute it not a crime</span><br/>
<span id='5'>To me or my swift passage, that I slide</span><br/>
<span id='6'>O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Of that wide gap, since it is in my power</span><br/>
<span id='8'>To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour</span><br/>
<span id='9'>To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass</span><br/>
<span id='10'>The same I am, ere ancient'st order was</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Or what is now received: I witness to</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The times that brought them in; so shall I do</span><br/>
<span id='13'>To the freshest things now reigning and make stale</span><br/>
<span id='14'>The glistering of this present, as my tale</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>I turn my glass and give my scene such growing</span><br/>
<span id='17'>As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving</span><br/>
<span id='19'>That he shuts up himself, imagine me,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Gentle spectators, that I now may be</span><br/>
<span id='21'>In fair Bohemia, and remember well,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel</span><br/>
<span id='23'>I now name to you; and with speed so pace</span><br/>
<span id='24'>To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Equal with wondering: what of her ensues</span><br/>
<span id='26'>I list not prophecy; but let Time's news</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Be known when 'tis brought forth.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>A shepherd's daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And what to her adheres, which follows after,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>If ever you have spent time worse ere now;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>If never, yet that Time himself doth say</span><br/>
<span id='33'>He wishes earnestly you never may.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

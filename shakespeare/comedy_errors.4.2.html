<blockquote>
<em>Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye</span><br/>
<span id='3'>That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?</span><br/>
<span id='5'>What observation madest thou in this case</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>First he denied you had in him no right.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>He meant he did me none; the more my spite.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Then swore he that he was a stranger here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Then pleaded I for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>And what said he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>With words that in an honest suit might move.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Didst speak him fair?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Have patience, I beseech.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Who would be jealous then of such a one?</span><br/>
<span id='26'>No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Ah, but I think him better than I say,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DROMIO of Syracuse</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>How hast thou lost thy breath?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>By running fast.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that</span><br/>
<span id='41'>countermands</span><br/>
<span id='42'>The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Why, man, what is the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Go fetch it, sister.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Luciana</em></p>
<span id='52'>This I wonder at,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Tell me, was he arrested on a band?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>What, the chain?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>It was two ere I left him, and now the clock</span><br/>
<span id='60'>strikes one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>The hours come back! that did I never hear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>O, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for</span><br/>
<span id='63'>very fear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's</span><br/>
<span id='66'>worth, to season.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say</span><br/>
<span id='68'>That Time comes stealing on by night and day?</span><br/>
<span id='69'>If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Go, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And bring thy master home immediately.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Come, sister: I am press'd down with conceit&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Conceit, my comfort and my injury.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

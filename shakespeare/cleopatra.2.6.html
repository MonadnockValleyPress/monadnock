<h1>Antony and Cleopatra</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene VI</h3>
<h4>Near Misenum.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door,  with drum and trumpet: at another, OCTAVIUS CAESAR,  MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MECAENAS, with Soldiers marching</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Your hostages I have, so have you mine;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And we shall talk before we fight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Most meet</span><br/>
<span id='4'>That first we come to words; and therefore have we</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Our written purposes before us sent;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us know</span><br/>
<span id='7'>If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And carry back to Sicily much tall youth</span><br/>
<span id='9'>That else must perish here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>To you all three,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>The senators alone of this great world,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Chief factors for the gods, I do not know</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Wherefore my father should revengers want,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>There saw you labouring for him. What was't</span><br/>
<span id='17'>That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To drench the Capitol; but that they would</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Have one man but a man? And that is it</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burthen</span><br/>
<span id='23'>The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant</span><br/>
<span id='24'>To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Cast on my noble father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Take your time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st</span><br/>
<span id='29'>How much we do o'er-count thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>At land, indeed,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Remain in't as thou mayst.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Be pleased to tell us&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>For this is from the present&mdash;how you take</span><br/>
<span id='36'>The offers we have sent you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>There's the point.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Which do not be entreated to, but weigh</span><br/>
<span id='39'>What it is worth embraced.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>And what may follow,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>To try a larger fortune.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>You have made me offer</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon</span><br/>
<span id='46'>To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Our targes undinted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>That's our offer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Know, then,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>I came before you here a man prepared</span><br/>
<span id='51'>To take this offer: but Mark Antony</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Put me to some impatience: though I lose</span><br/>
<span id='53'>The praise of it by telling, you must know,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>When Caesar and your brother were at blows,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Your mother came to Sicily and did find</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Her welcome friendly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>I have heard it, Pompey;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And am well studied for a liberal thanks</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Which I do owe you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Let me have your hand:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>I did not think, sir, to have met you here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>For I have gain'd by 't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Since I saw you last,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>There is a change upon you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Well, I know not</span><br/>
<span id='68'>What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>But in my bosom shall she never come,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>To make my heart her vassal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Well met here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>I crave our composition may be written,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And seal'd between us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>That's the next to do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Draw lots who shall begin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>That will I, Pompey.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>No, Antony, take the lot: but, first</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Grew fat with feasting there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>You have heard much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>I have fair meanings, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>And fair words to them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Then so much have I heard:</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And I have heard, Apollodorus carried&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>No more of that: he did so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>What, I pray you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Well;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And well am like to do; for, I perceive,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Four feasts are toward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Let me shake thy hand;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>When I have envied thy behavior.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Sir,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>When you have well deserved ten times as much</span><br/>
<span id='101'>As I have said you did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Enjoy thy plainness,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>It nothing ill becomes thee.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Aboard my galley I invite you all:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Will you lead, lords?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Show us the way, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Come.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>MENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>[Aside]  Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have</span><br/>
<span id='109'>made this treaty.&mdash;You and I have known, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>At sea, I think.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>We have, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>You have done well by water.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>And you by land.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>I will praise any man that will praise me; though it</span><br/>
<span id='115'>cannot be denied what I have done by land.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>MENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Nor what I have done by water.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Yes, something you can deny for your own</span><br/>
<span id='118'>safety: you have been a great thief by sea.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>MENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>And you by land.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>There I deny my land service. But give me your</span><br/>
<span id='121'>hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they</span><br/>
<span id='122'>might take two thieves kissing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>MENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>But there is never a fair woman has a true face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>MENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>No slander; they steal hearts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>We came hither to fight with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>MENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>MENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony</span><br/>
<span id='131'>here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Caesar's sister is called Octavia.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>MENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>MENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Pray ye, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>'Tis true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>MENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would</span><br/>
<span id='139'>not prophesy so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>MENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>I think the policy of that purpose made more in the</span><br/>
<span id='141'>marriage than the love of the parties.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>I think so too. But you shall find, the band that</span><br/>
<span id='143'>seems to tie their friendship together will be the</span><br/>
<span id='144'>very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a</span><br/>
<span id='145'>holy, cold, and still conversation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>MENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Who would not have his wife so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.</span><br/>
<span id='148'>He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the</span><br/>
<span id='149'>sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as</span><br/>
<span id='150'>I said before, that which is the strength of their</span><br/>
<span id='151'>amity shall prove the immediate author of their</span><br/>
<span id='152'>variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:</span><br/>
<span id='153'>he married but his occasion here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>MENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?</span><br/>
<span id='155'>I have a health for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>MENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Come, let's away.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

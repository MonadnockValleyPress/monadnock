<h1>The Merchant of Venice</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene V</H3>
<h4>The same. A garden.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father</span><br/>
<span id='2'>are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I</span><br/>
<span id='3'>promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with</span><br/>
<span id='4'>you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you</span><br/>
<span id='6'>are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do</span><br/>
<span id='7'>you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard</span><br/>
<span id='8'>hope neither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>JESSICA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>And what hope is that, I pray thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you</span><br/>
<span id='11'>not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>JESSICA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the</span><br/>
<span id='13'>sins of my mother should be visited upon me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and</span><br/>
<span id='15'>mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I</span><br/>
<span id='16'>fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are</span><br/>
<span id='17'>gone both ways.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>JESSICA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Christian.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians</span><br/>
<span id='21'>enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by</span><br/>
<span id='22'>another. This making Christians will raise the</span><br/>
<span id='23'>price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we</span><br/>
<span id='24'>shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LORENZO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>JESSICA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LORENZO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if</span><br/>
<span id='27'>you thus get my wife into corners.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>JESSICA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I</span><br/>
<span id='29'>are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for</span><br/>
<span id='30'>me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he</span><br/>
<span id='31'>says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the</span><br/>
<span id='33'>price of pork.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LORENZO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than</span><br/>
<span id='35'>you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>but if she be less than an honest woman, she is</span><br/>
<span id='39'>indeed more than I took her for.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LORENZO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>How every fool can play upon the word! I think the</span><br/>
<span id='41'>best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>and discourse grow commendable in none only but</span><br/>
<span id='43'>parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LORENZO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bid</span><br/>
<span id='46'>them prepare dinner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>That is done too, sir; only 'cover' is the word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LORENZO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Will you cover then, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LORENZO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show</span><br/>
<span id='51'>the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray</span><br/>
<span id='52'>tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve</span><br/>
<span id='54'>in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the</span><br/>
<span id='56'>meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in</span><br/>
<span id='57'>to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and</span><br/>
<span id='58'>conceits shall govern.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LORENZO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>O dear discretion, how his words are suited!</span><br/>
<span id='60'>The fool hath planted in his memory</span><br/>
<span id='61'>An army of good words; and I do know</span><br/>
<span id='62'>A many fools, that stand in better place,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Defy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica?</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>JESSICA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Past all expressing. It is very meet</span><br/>
<span id='68'>The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>For, having such a blessing in his lady,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And if on earth he do not mean it, then</span><br/>
<span id='72'>In reason he should never come to heaven</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And on the wager lay two earthly women,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And Portia one, there must be something else</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Hath not her fellow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LORENZO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Even such a husband</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>JESSICA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LORENZO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>I will anon: first, let us go to dinner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>JESSICA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LORENZO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>'	Then, howso'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things</span><br/>
<span id='85'>I shall digest it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>JESSICA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>                  Well, I'll set you forth.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

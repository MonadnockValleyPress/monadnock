<h1>Henry VI, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Plains in Gascony.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter a Messenger that meets YORK. Enter YORK with trumpet and many Soldiers</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Are not the speedy scouts return'd again,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>They are return'd, my lord, and give it out</span><br/>
<span id='4'>That he is march'd to Bourdeaux with his power,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>To fight with Talbot: as he march'd along,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>By your espials were discovered</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Which join'd with him and made their march for Bourdeaux.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>A plague upon that villain Somerset,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>That thus delays my promised supply</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And I am lowted by a traitor villain</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And cannot help the noble chevalier:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>God comfort him in this necessity!</span><br/>
<span id='16'>If he miscarry, farewell wars in France.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Sir William LUCY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LUCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Thou princely leader of our English strength,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Never so needful on the earth of France,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Who now is girdled with a waist of iron</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And hemm'd about with grim destruction:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>To Bourdeaux, warlike duke! to Bourdeaux, York!</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Else, farewell Talbot, France, and England's honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!</span><br/>
<span id='26'>So should we save a valiant gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='27'>By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>That thus we die, while remiss traitors sleep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LUCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>O, send some succor to the distress'd lord!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>We mourn, France smiles; we lose, they daily get;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>All 'long of this vile traitor Somerset.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LUCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And on his son young John, who two hours since</span><br/>
<span id='36'>I met in travel toward his warlike father!</span><br/>
<span id='37'>This seven years did not Talbot see his son;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And now they meet where both their lives are done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Alas, what joy shall noble Talbot have</span><br/>
<span id='40'>To bid his young son welcome to his grave?</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Away! vexation almost stops my breath,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>That sunder'd friends greet in the hour of death.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>But curse the cause I cannot aid the man.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Maine, Blois, Poictiers, and Tours, are won away,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>'Long all of Somerset and his delay.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit, with his soldiers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LUCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Thus, while the vulture of sedition</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss</span><br/>
<span id='50'>The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>That ever living man of memory,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Lives, honours, lands and all hurry to loss.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

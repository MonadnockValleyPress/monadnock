<h1>King Lear</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Gloucester's castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GLOUCESTER and EDMUND</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural</span><br/>
<span id='2'>dealing. When I desire their leave that I might</span><br/>
<span id='3'>pity him, they took from me the use of mine own</span><br/>
<span id='4'>house; charged me, on pain of their perpetual</span><br/>
<span id='5'>displeasure, neither to speak of him, entreat for</span><br/>
<span id='6'>him, nor any way sustain him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Most savage and unnatural!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Go to; say you nothing. There's a division betwixt</span><br/>
<span id='9'>the dukes; and a worse matter than that: I have</span><br/>
<span id='10'>received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be</span><br/>
<span id='11'>spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>these injuries the king now bears will be revenged</span><br/>
<span id='13'>home; there's part of a power already footed: we</span><br/>
<span id='14'>must incline to the king. I will seek him, and</span><br/>
<span id='15'>privily relieve him: go you and maintain talk with</span><br/>
<span id='16'>the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>if he ask for me. I am ill, and gone to bed.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Though I die for it, as no less is threatened me,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>the king my old master must be relieved. There is</span><br/>
<span id='20'>some strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Instantly know; and of that letter too:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me</span><br/>
<span id='24'>That which my father loses; no less than all:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The younger rises when the old doth fall.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

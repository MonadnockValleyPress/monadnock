<h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Where the devil should this Romeo be?</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Came he not home to-night?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Hath sent a letter to his father's house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>A challenge, on my life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Romeo will answer it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Any man that can write may answer a letter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he</span><br/>
<span id='12'>dares, being dared.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a</span><br/>
<span id='14'>white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a</span><br/>
<span id='15'>love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the</span><br/>
<span id='16'>blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to</span><br/>
<span id='17'>encounter Tybalt?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Why, what is Tybalt?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is</span><br/>
<span id='20'>the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as</span><br/>
<span id='21'>you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and</span><br/>
<span id='22'>proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and</span><br/>
<span id='23'>the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk</span><br/>
<span id='24'>button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the</span><br/>
<span id='25'>very first house, of the first and second cause:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the</span><br/>
<span id='27'>hai!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>The what?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting</span><br/>
<span id='30'>fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good</span><br/>
<span id='32'>whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with</span><br/>
<span id='34'>these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these</span><br/>
<span id='35'>perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their</span><br/>
<span id='37'>bones, their bones!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ROMEO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers</span><br/>
<span id='41'>that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a</span><br/>
<span id='42'>kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to</span><br/>
<span id='43'>be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey</span><br/>
<span id='45'>eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation</span><br/>
<span id='47'>to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit</span><br/>
<span id='48'>fairly last night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in</span><br/>
<span id='52'>such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>That's as much as to say, such a case as yours</span><br/>
<span id='54'>constrains a man to bow in the hams.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Meaning, to court'sy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Thou hast most kindly hit it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>A most courteous exposition.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Pink for flower.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Right.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Why, then is my pump well flowered.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast</span><br/>
<span id='63'>worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it</span><br/>
<span id='64'>is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>O single-soled jest, solely singular for the</span><br/>
<span id='66'>singleness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have</span><br/>
<span id='70'>done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of</span><br/>
<span id='71'>thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>was I with you there for the goose?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast</span><br/>
<span id='74'>not there for the goose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Nay, good goose, bite not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most</span><br/>
<span id='78'>sharp sauce.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an</span><br/>
<span id='81'>inch narrow to an ell broad!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added</span><br/>
<span id='83'>to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?</span><br/>
<span id='85'>now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art</span><br/>
<span id='86'>thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:</span><br/>
<span id='87'>for this drivelling love is like a great natural,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Stop there, stop there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and</span><br/>
<span id='94'>meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Here's goodly gear!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Nurse and PETER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>A sail, a sail!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Two, two; a shirt and a smock.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Peter!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>PETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Anon!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>My fan, Peter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the</span><br/>
<span id='102'>fairer face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>God ye good morrow, gentlemen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Is it good den?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the</span><br/>
<span id='107'>dial is now upon the prick of noon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Out upon you! what a man are you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to</span><br/>
<span id='110'>mar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'</span><br/>
<span id='112'>quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I</span><br/>
<span id='113'>may find the young Romeo?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when</span><br/>
<span id='115'>you have found him than he was when you sought him:</span><br/>
<span id='116'>I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>You say well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>wisely, wisely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with</span><br/>
<span id='121'>you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>She will indite him to some supper.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>What hast thou found?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.</span><br/>
<p><em>Sings</em></p>
<span id='127'>An old hare hoar,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>And an old hare hoar,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Is very good meat in lent</span><br/>
<span id='130'>But a hare that is hoar</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Is too much for a score,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>When it hoars ere it be spent.</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll</span><br/>
<span id='134'>to dinner, thither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>I will follow you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,</span><br/>
<p><em>Singing</em></p>
<span id='137'>'lady, lady, lady.'</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy</span><br/>
<span id='139'>merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>and will speak more in a minute than he will stand</span><br/>
<span id='142'>to in a month.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him</span><br/>
<span id='144'>down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am</span><br/>
<span id='147'>none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by</span><br/>
<span id='148'>too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>PETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon</span><br/>
<span id='150'>should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare</span><br/>
<span id='151'>draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a</span><br/>
<span id='152'>good quarrel, and the law on my side.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about</span><br/>
<span id='154'>me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:</span><br/>
<span id='155'>and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you</span><br/>
<span id='156'>out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:</span><br/>
<span id='157'>but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into</span><br/>
<span id='158'>a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross</span><br/>
<span id='159'>kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman</span><br/>
<span id='160'>is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double</span><br/>
<span id='161'>with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered</span><br/>
<span id='162'>to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I</span><br/>
<span id='164'>protest unto thee&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as</span><br/>
<span id='169'>I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>Bid her devise</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>No truly sir; not a penny.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>Go to; I say you shall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Within this hour my man shall be with thee</span><br/>
<span id='179'>And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Which to the high top-gallant of my joy</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Must be my convoy in the secret night.</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>What say'st thou, my dear nurse?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Two may keep counsel, putting one away?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>NURSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady&mdash;Lord,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:&mdash;O, there</span><br/>
<span id='191'>is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain</span><br/>
<span id='192'>lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief</span><br/>
<span id='193'>see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her</span><br/>
<span id='194'>sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer</span><br/>
<span id='195'>man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks</span><br/>
<span id='196'>as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not</span><br/>
<span id='197'>rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for</span><br/>
<span id='200'>the&mdash;No; I know it begins with some other</span><br/>
<span id='201'>letter:&mdash;and she hath the prettiest sententious of</span><br/>
<span id='202'>it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good</span><br/>
<span id='203'>to hear it.</span><br/>

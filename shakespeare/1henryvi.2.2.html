<h1>Henry VI, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Orleans. Within the town.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, a Captain, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>The day begins to break, and night is fled,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Here sound retreat, and cease our hot pursuit.</span><br/>
<p><em>Retreat sounded</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>TALBOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Bring forth the body of old Salisbury,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And here advance it in the market-place,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>The middle centre of this cursed town.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Now have I paid my vow unto his soul;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>For every drop of blood was drawn from him,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And that hereafter ages may behold</span><br/>
<span id='11'>What ruin happen'd in revenge of him,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Within their chiefest temple I'll erect</span><br/>
<span id='13'>A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Upon the which, that every one may read,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Shall be engraved the sack of Orleans,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The treacherous manner of his mournful death</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And what a terror he had been to France.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Nor any of his false confederates.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>They did amongst the troops of armed men</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Myself, as far as I could well discern</span><br/>
<span id='27'>For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves</span><br/>
<span id='31'>That could not live asunder day or night.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>After that things are set in order here,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>We'll follow them with all the power we have.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>All hail, my lords! which of this princely train</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Call ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts</span><br/>
<span id='36'>So much applauded through the realm of France?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>TALBOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Here is the Talbot: who would speak with him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>With modesty admiring thy renown,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe</span><br/>
<span id='41'>To visit her poor castle where she lies,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>That she may boast she hath beheld the man</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Whose glory fills the world with loud report.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>When ladies crave to be encounter'd with.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>TALBOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Could not prevail with all their oratory,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Yet hath a woman's kindness over-ruled:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And therefore tell her I return great thanks,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And in submission will attend on her.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Will not your honours bear me company?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>No, truly; it is more than manners will:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And I have heard it said, unbidden guests</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Are often welcomest when they are gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>TALBOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Well then, alone, since there's no remedy,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>I mean to prove this lady's courtesy.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Come hither, captain.</span><br/>
<p><em>Whispers</em></p>
<span id='60'>You perceive my mind?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Captain</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>I do, my lord, and mean accordingly.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>If you will now unite in your complaints,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And force them with a constancy, the cardinal</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Cannot stand under them: if you omit</span><br/>
<span id='4'>The offer of this time, I cannot promise</span><br/>
<span id='5'>But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>With these you bear already.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SURREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>I am joyful</span><br/>
<span id='8'>To meet the least occasion that may give me</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Remembrance of my father-in-law, the duke,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To be revenged on him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Which of the peers</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Strangely neglected? when did he regard</span><br/>
<span id='14'>The stamp of nobleness in any person</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Out of himself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>                  My lords, you speak your pleasures:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>What he deserves of you and me I know;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>What we can do to him, though now the time</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Gives way to us, I much fear. If you cannot</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Bar his access to the king, never attempt</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Any thing on him; for he hath a witchcraft</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Over the king in's tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>O, fear him not;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>His spell in that is out: the king hath found</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Matter against him that for ever mars</span><br/>
<span id='26'>The honey of his language. No, he's settled,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Not to come off, in his displeasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SURREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Sir,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>I should be glad to hear such news as this</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Once every hour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>                  Believe it, this is true:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>In the divorce his contrary proceedings</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Are all unfolded wherein he appears</span><br/>
<span id='34'>As I would wish mine enemy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SURREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>How came</span><br/>
<span id='36'>His practises to light?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Most strangely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SURREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>O, how, how?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>The cardinal's letters to the pope miscarried,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And came to the eye o' the king: wherein was read,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>How that the cardinal did entreat his holiness</span><br/>
<span id='42'>To stay the judgment o' the divorce; for if</span><br/>
<span id='43'>It did take place, 'I do,' quoth he, 'perceive</span><br/>
<span id='44'>My king is tangled in affection to</span><br/>
<span id='45'>A creature of the queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'</span><br/>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SURREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Has the king this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>                  Believe it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SURREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Will this work?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>The king in this perceives him, how he coasts</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And hedges his own way. But in this point</span><br/>
<span id='51'>All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic</span><br/>
<span id='52'>After his patient's death: the king already</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Hath married the fair lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>SURREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Would he had!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>May you be happy in your wish, my lord</span><br/>
<span id='56'>For, I profess, you have it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SURREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Now, all my joy</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Trace the conjunction!</span><br/>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>My amen to't!</span><br/>

<span id='60'>All men's!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>There's order given for her coronation:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Marry, this is yet but young, and may be left</span><br/>
<span id='63'>To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>She is a gallant creature, and complete</span><br/>
<span id='65'>In mind and feature: I persuade me, from her</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Will fall some blessing to this land, which shall</span><br/>
<span id='67'>In it be memorised.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SURREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>But, will the king</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Digest this letter of the cardinal's?</span><br/>
<span id='70'>The Lord forbid!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>                  Marry, amen!</span><br/>

<span id='speech24'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>No, no;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Is stol'n away to Rome; hath ta'en no leave;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Has left the cause o' the king unhandled; and</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Is posted, as the agent of our cardinal,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>To second all his plot. I do assure you</span><br/>
<span id='79'>The king cried Ha! at this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Now, God incense him,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And let him cry Ha! louder!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>But, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>When returns Cranmer?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>He is return'd in his opinions; which</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Have satisfied the king for his divorce,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Together with all famous colleges</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Almost in Christendom: shortly, I believe,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>His second marriage shall be publish'd, and</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Her coronation. Katharine no more</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Shall be call'd queen, but princess dowager</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And widow to Prince Arthur.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>

<span id='92'>This same Cranmer's</span><br/>

<span id='104'>Look'd he o' the inside of the paper?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CROMWELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Presently</span><br/>
<span id='106'>He did unseal them: and the first he view'd,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>He did it with a serious mind; a heed</span><br/>

<p><em>Exit CROMWELL</em></p>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='114'>It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon,</span><br/>

<span id='118'>No, we'll no Bullens. Speedily I wish</span><br/>
<span id='119'>To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!</span><br/>

<span id='speech42'><strong>SURREY</strong></span>

<span id='123'>Sharp enough,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Lord, for thy justice!</span><br/>

<span id='132'>Our cause, that she should lie i' the bosom of</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Our hard-ruled king. Again, there is sprung up</span><br/>
<span id='134'>An heretic, an arch one, Cranmer; one</span><br/>

<span id='146'>My lord, we have</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Stood here observing him: some strange commotion</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Is in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts;</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Then lays his finger on his temple, straight</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Springs out into fast gait; then stops again,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts</span><br/>
<span id='153'>His eye against the moon: in most strange postures</span><br/>
<span id='154'>We have seen him set himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>

<span id='155'>It may well be;</span><br/>

<span id='158'>As I required: and wot you what I found</span><br/>
<span id='159'>There,&mdash;on my conscience, put unwittingly?</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing;</span><br/>
<span id='161'>The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which</span><br/>
<span id='163'>I find at such proud rate, that it out-speaks</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Possession of a subject.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='165'>It's heaven's will:</span><br/>

<span id='171'>Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid</span><br/>
<span id='172'>His thinkings are below the moon, not worth</span><br/>
<span id='173'>His serious considering.</span><br/>
<p><em>King HENRY VIII takes his seat; whispers LOVELL, who goes to CARDINAL WOLSEY</em></p>

<span id='176'>Good my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Of your best graces in your mind; the which</span><br/>
<span id='179'>You were now running o'er: you have scarce time</span><br/>
<span id='180'>To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span</span><br/>
<span id='181'>To keep your earthly audit: sure, in that</span><br/>
<span id='182'>I deem you an ill husband, and am glad</span><br/>

<span id='speech54'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>

<span id='185'>For holy offices I have a time; a time</span><br/>
<span id='186'>To think upon the part of business which</span><br/>

<span id='198'>His said he did; and with his deed did crown</span><br/>
<span id='199'>His word upon you. Since I had my office,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>I have kept you next my heart; have not alone</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Employ'd you where high profits might come home,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>But pared my present havings, to bestow</span><br/>

<span id='214'>Beyond all man's endeavours: my endeavours</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Have ever come too short of my desires,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>Yet filed with my abilities: mine own ends</span><br/>
<span id='217'>Have been mine so that evermore they pointed</span><br/>
<span id='218'>To the good of your most sacred person and</span><br/>
<span id='219'>The profit of the state. For your great graces</span><br/>

<h4>Westminster. The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter WARWICK and the Lord Chief-Justice, meeting</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>How now, my lord chief-justice! whither away?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>How doth the king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Exceeding well; his cares are now all ended.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>I hope, not dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>He's walk'd the way of nature;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And to our purposes he lives no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>I would his majesty had call'd me with him:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>The service that I truly did his life</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Hath left me open to all injuries.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Indeed I think the young king loves you not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>I know he doth not, and do arm myself</span><br/>
<span id='12'>To welcome the condition of the time,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Which cannot look more hideously upon me</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Than I have drawn it in my fantasy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>O that the living Harry had the temper</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Of him, the worst of these three gentlemen!</span><br/>
<span id='18'>How many nobles then should hold their places</span><br/>
<span id='19'>That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>O God, I fear all will be overturn'd!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LANCASTER, CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, WESTMORELAND, and others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Good morrow, cousin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>We meet like men that had forgot to speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>We do remember; but our argument</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Is all too heavy to admit much talk.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>O, good my lord, you have lost a friend indeed;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And I dare swear you borrow not that face</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Of seeming sorrow, it is sure your own.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Though no man be assured what grace to find,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>You stand in coldest expectation:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>I am the sorrier; would 'twere otherwise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Which swims against your stream of quality.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Sweet princes, what I did, I did in honour,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Led by the impartial conduct of my soul:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And never shall you see that I will beg</span><br/>
<span id='39'>A ragged and forestall'd remission.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>If truth and upright innocency fail me,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>I'll to the king my master that is dead,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And tell him who hath sent me after him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Here comes the prince.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter KING HENRY V, attended</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Good morrow; and God save your majesty!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Sits not so easy on me as you think.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>This is the English, not the Turkish court;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>For, by my faith, it very well becomes you:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Sorrow so royally in you appears</span><br/>
<span id='53'>That I will deeply put the fashion on</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And wear it in my heart: why then, be sad;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>But entertain no more of it, good brothers,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Than a joint burden laid upon us all.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>For me, by heaven, I bid you be assured,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>I'll be your father and your brother too;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Let me but bear your love, I'll bear your cares:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Yet weep that Harry's dead; and so will I;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>But Harry lives, that shall convert those tears</span><br/>
<span id='62'>By number into hours of happiness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Princes</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>We hope no other from your majesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>You all look strangely on me: and you most;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>You are, I think, assured I love you not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>I am assured, if I be measured rightly,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>No!</span><br/>
<span id='69'>How might a prince of my great hopes forget</span><br/>
<span id='70'>So great indignities you laid upon me?</span><br/>
<span id='71'>What! rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison</span><br/>
<span id='72'>The immediate heir of England! Was this easy?</span><br/>
<span id='73'>May this be wash'd in Lethe, and forgotten?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>I then did use the person of your father;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>The image of his power lay then in me:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And, in the administration of his law,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Your highness pleased to forget my place,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>The majesty and power of law and justice,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>The image of the king whom I presented,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And struck me in my very seat of judgment;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Whereon, as an offender to your father,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>I gave bold way to my authority</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And did commit you. If the deed were ill,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Be you contented, wearing now the garland,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>To have a son set your decrees at nought,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>To pluck down justice from your awful bench,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>To trip the course of law and blunt the sword</span><br/>
<span id='89'>That guards the peace and safety of your person;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And mock your workings in a second body.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Be now the father and propose a son,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Hear your own dignity so much profaned,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And then imagine me taking your part</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And in your power soft silencing your son:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>After this cold considerance, sentence me;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And, as you are a king, speak in your state</span><br/>
<span id='101'>What I have done that misbecame my place,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>My person, or my liege's sovereignty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>You are right, justice, and you weigh this well;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Therefore still bear the balance and the sword:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And I do wish your honours may increase,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Till you do live to see a son of mine</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Offend you and obey you, as I did.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>So shall I live to speak my father's words:</span><br/>
<span id='109'>'Happy am I, that have a man so bold,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>That dares do justice on my proper son;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And not less happy, having such a son,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>That would deliver up his greatness so</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Into the hands of justice.' You did commit me:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>For which, I do commit into your hand</span><br/>
<span id='115'>The unstained sword that you have used to bear;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>With this remembrance, that you use the same</span><br/>
<span id='117'>With the like bold, just and impartial spirit</span><br/>
<span id='118'>As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand.</span><br/>
<span id='119'>You shall be as a father to my youth:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>And I will stoop and humble my intents</span><br/>
<span id='122'>To your well-practised wise directions.</span><br/>
<span id='123'>And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>My father is gone wild into his grave,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>For in his tomb lie my affections;</span><br/>
<span id='126'>And with his spirit sadly I survive,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>To mock the expectation of the world,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>To frustrate prophecies and to raze out</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down</span><br/>
<span id='130'>After my seeming. The tide of blood in me</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now:</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Where it shall mingle with the state of floods</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And flow henceforth in formal majesty.</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Now call we our high court of parliament:</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>That the great body of our state may go</span><br/>
<span id='138'>In equal rank with the best govern'd nation;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>That war, or peace, or both at once, may be</span><br/>
<span id='140'>As things acquainted and familiar to us;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Our coronation done, we will accite,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>As I before remember'd, all our state:</span><br/>
<span id='144'>And, God consigning to my good intents,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>God shorten Harry's happy life one day!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

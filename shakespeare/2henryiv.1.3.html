<h1>Henry IV, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</h3>
<h4>York. The Archbishop's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the Lords HASTINGS, MOWBRAY, and BARDOLPH</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>I well allow the occasion of our arms;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>But gladly would be better satisfied</span><br/>
<span id='7'>How in our means we should advance ourselves</span><br/>
<span id='8'>To look with forehead bold and big enough</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Upon the power and puissance of the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Our present musters grow upon the file</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To five and twenty thousand men of choice;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And our supplies live largely in the hope</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns</span><br/>
<span id='14'>With an incensed fire of injuries.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Whether our present five and twenty thousand</span><br/>
<span id='17'>May hold up head without Northumberland?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>With him, we may.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>                  Yea, marry, there's the point:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>But if without him we be thought too feeble,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>My judgment is, we should not step too far</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Till we had his assistance by the hand;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>For in a theme so bloody-faced as this</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Conjecture, expectation, and surmise</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Of aids incertain should not be admitted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed</span><br/>
<span id='27'>It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Eating the air on promise of supply,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Flattering himself in project of a power</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And so, with great imagination</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Proper to madmen, led his powers to death</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And winking leap'd into destruction.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt</span><br/>
<span id='36'>To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Yes, if this present quality of war,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Lives so in hope as in an early spring</span><br/>
<span id='40'>We see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Hope gives not so much warrant as despair</span><br/>
<span id='42'>That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>We first survey the plot, then draw the model;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And when we see the figure of the house,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Then must we rate the cost of the erection;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Which if we find outweighs ability,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>What do we then but draw anew the model</span><br/>
<span id='48'>In fewer offices, or at last desist</span><br/>
<span id='49'>To build at all? Much more, in this great work,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And set another up, should we survey</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The plot of situation and the model,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Consent upon a sure foundation,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Question surveyors, know our own estate,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>How able such a work to undergo,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>To weigh against his opposite; or else</span><br/>
<span id='57'>We fortify in paper and in figures,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Using the names of men instead of men:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Like one that draws the model of a house</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost</span><br/>
<span id='62'>A naked subject to the weeping clouds</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd</span><br/>
<span id='66'>The utmost man of expectation,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>I think we are a body strong enough,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Even as we are, to equal with the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>What, is the king but five and twenty thousand?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>For his divisions, as the times do brawl,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Are in three heads: one power against the French,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And one against Glendower; perforce a third</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Must take up us: so is the unfirm king</span><br/>
<span id='75'>In three divided; and his coffers sound</span><br/>
<span id='76'>With hollow poverty and emptiness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>That he should draw his several strengths together</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And come against us in full puissance,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Need not be dreaded.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>If he should do so,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Baying him at the heels: never fear that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LORD BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Who is it like should lead his forces hither?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>But who is substituted 'gainst the French,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>I have no certain notice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Let us on,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And publish the occasion of our arms.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Their over-greedy love hath surfeited:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>An habitation giddy and unsure</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>O thou fond many, with what loud applause</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And howl'st to find it. What trust is in</span><br/>
<span id='104'>these times?</span><br/>
<span id='105'>They that, when Richard lived, would have him die,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Are now become enamour'd on his grave:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Thou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly head</span><br/>
<span id='108'>When through proud London he came sighing on</span><br/>
<span id='109'>After the admired heels of Bolingbroke,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Criest now 'O earth, yield us that king again,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accursed!</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Past and to come seems best; things present worst.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Shall we go draw our numbers and set on?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>We are time's subjects, and time bids be gone.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

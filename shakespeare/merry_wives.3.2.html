<h1>The Merry Wives of Windsor</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Nay, keep your way, little gallant; you were wont to</span><br/>
<span id='2'>be a follower, but now you are a leader. Whether</span><br/>
<span id='3'>had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master's heels?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ROBIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man</span><br/>
<span id='5'>than follow him like a dwarf.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>O, you are a flattering boy: now I see you'll be a courtier.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter FORD</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for want</span><br/>
<span id='10'>of company. I think, if your husbands were dead,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>you two would marry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Be sure of that,&mdash;two other husbands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Where had you this pretty weather-cock?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my</span><br/>
<span id='15'>husband had him of. What do you call your knight's</span><br/>
<span id='16'>name, sirrah?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ROBIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Sir John Falstaff.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Sir John Falstaff!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>He, he; I can never hit on's name. There is such a</span><br/>
<span id='20'>league between my good man and he! Is your wife at</span><br/>
<span id='21'>home indeed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Indeed she is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>By your leave, sir: I am sick till I see her.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Has Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath he any</span><br/>
<span id='25'>thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as</span><br/>
<span id='27'>easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve</span><br/>
<span id='28'>score. He pieces out his wife's inclination; he</span><br/>
<span id='29'>gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she's</span><br/>
<span id='30'>going to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her. A</span><br/>
<span id='31'>man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Falstaff's boy with her! Good plots, they are laid;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>and our revolted wives share damnation together.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Well; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck</span><br/>
<span id='35'>the borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and</span><br/>
<span id='37'>wilful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all</span><br/>
<span id='38'>my neighbours shall cry aim.</span><br/>
<p><em>Clock heard</em></p>
<span id='39'>The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me</span><br/>
<span id='40'>search: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be</span><br/>
<span id='41'>rather praised for this than mocked; for it is as</span><br/>
<span id='42'>positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is</span><br/>
<span id='43'>there: I will go.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, SLENDER, Host, SIR HUGH EVANS, DOCTOR CAIUS, and RUGBY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></span>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PAGE</strong></span>

<span id='speech18'><strong>& C</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Well met, Master Ford.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Trust me, a good knot: I have good cheer at home;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>and I pray you all go with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>I must excuse myself, Master Ford.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SLENDER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>And so must I, sir: we have appointed to dine with</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for</span><br/>
<span id='50'>more money than I'll speak of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>We have lingered about a match between Anne Page and</span><br/>
<span id='52'>my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>SLENDER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>I hope I have your good will, father Page.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>You have, Master Slender; I stand wholly for you:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>but my wife, master doctor, is for you altogether.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DOCTOR CAIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me: my nursh-a</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Quickly tell me so mush.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>What say you to young Master Fenton? he capers, he</span><br/>
<span id='59'>dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he</span><br/>
<span id='60'>speaks holiday, he smells April and May: he will</span><br/>
<span id='61'>carry't, he will carry't; 'tis in his buttons; he</span><br/>
<span id='62'>will carry't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is</span><br/>
<span id='64'>of no having: he kept company with the wild prince</span><br/>
<span id='65'>and Poins; he is of too high a region; he knows too</span><br/>
<span id='66'>much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes</span><br/>
<span id='67'>with the finger of my substance: if he take her,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>let him take her simply; the wealth I have waits on</span><br/>
<span id='69'>my consent, and my consent goes not that way.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>I beseech you heartily, some of you go home with me</span><br/>
<span id='71'>to dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have</span><br/>
<span id='72'>sport; I will show you a monster. Master doctor,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>you shall go; so shall you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Well, fare you well: we shall have the freer wooing</span><br/>
<span id='75'>at Master Page's.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt SHALLOW, and SLENDER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DOCTOR CAIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit RUGBY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Farewell, my hearts: I will to my honest knight</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Falstaff, and drink canary with him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>[Aside]  I think I shall drink in pipe wine first</span><br/>
<span id='80'>with him; I'll make him dance. Will you go, gentles?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Have with you to see this monster.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

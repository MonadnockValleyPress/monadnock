<h1>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene VI</h3>
<h4>The same. A room in the brothel.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Pandar</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she</span><br/>
<span id='2'>had ne'er come here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Fie, fie upon her! she's able to freeze the god</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Priapus, and undo a whole generation. We must</span><br/>
<span id='5'>either get her ravished, or be rid of her. When she</span><br/>
<span id='6'>should do for clients her fitment, and do me the</span><br/>
<span id='7'>kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, her</span><br/>
<span id='9'>knees; that she would make a puritan of the devil,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>if he should cheapen a kiss of her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>'Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us</span><br/>
<span id='12'>of all our cavaliers, and make our swearers priests.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Pandar</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Now, the pox upon her green-sickness for me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>'Faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by the</span><br/>
<span id='15'>way to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>We should have both lord and lown, if the peevish</span><br/>
<span id='17'>baggage would but give way to customers.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LYSIMACHUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>How now! How a dozen of virginities?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Now, the gods to-bless your honour!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>I am glad to see your honour in good health.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>You may so; 'tis the better for you that your</span><br/>
<span id='22'>resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!</span><br/>
<span id='23'>wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal</span><br/>
<span id='24'>withal, and defy the surgeon?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>We have here one, sir, if she would&mdash;but there never</span><br/>
<span id='26'>came her like in Mytilene.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>If she'ld do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Your honour knows what 'tis to say well enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Well, call forth, call forth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall</span><br/>
<span id='31'>see a rose; and she were a rose indeed, if she had but&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>What, prithee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>O, sir, I can be modest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>That dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than it</span><br/>
<span id='35'>gives a good report to a number to be chaste.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit BOULT</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Here comes that which grows to the stalk; never</span><br/>
<span id='37'>plucked yet, I can assure you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter BOULT with MARINA</em></p>
<span id='38'>Is she not a fair creature?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>'Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Well, there's for you: leave us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>I beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, and</span><br/>
<span id='42'>I'll have done presently.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>I beseech you, do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>[To MARINA]  First, I would have you note, this is</span><br/>
<span id='45'>an honourable man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Next, he's the governor of this country, and a man</span><br/>
<span id='48'>whom I am bound to.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>If he govern the country, you are bound to him</span><br/>
<span id='50'>indeed; but how honourable he is in that, I know not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, will</span><br/>
<span id='52'>you use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Ha' you done?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>My lord, she's not paced yet: you must take some</span><br/>
<span id='56'>pains to work her to your manage. Come, we will</span><br/>
<span id='57'>leave his honour and her together. Go thy ways.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Bawd, Pandar, and BOULT</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Now, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>What trade, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Why, I cannot name't but I shall offend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>How long have you been of this profession?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>E'er since I can remember.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Did you go to 't so young? Were you a gamester at</span><br/>
<span id='65'>five or at seven?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a</span><br/>
<span id='68'>creature of sale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Do you know this house to be a place of such resort,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>and will come into 't? I hear say you are of</span><br/>
<span id='71'>honourable parts, and are the governor of this place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Why, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Who is my principal?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Why, your herb-woman; she that sets seeds and roots</span><br/>
<span id='75'>of shame and iniquity. O, you have heard something</span><br/>
<span id='76'>of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious</span><br/>
<span id='77'>wooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one, my</span><br/>
<span id='78'>authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly</span><br/>
<span id='79'>upon thee. Come, bring me to some private place:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>come, come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>If you were born to honour, show it now;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>If put upon you, make the judgment good</span><br/>
<span id='83'>That thought you worthy of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>How's this? how's this? Some more; be sage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>For me,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>That am a maid, though most ungentle fortune</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Have placed me in this sty, where, since I came,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Diseases have been sold dearer than physic,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>O, that the gods</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Would set me free from this unhallow'd place,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Though they did change me to the meanest bird</span><br/>
<span id='92'>That flies i' the purer air!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>I did not think</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Thou couldst have spoke so well; ne'er dream'd thou couldst.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Thy speech had alter'd it. Hold, here's gold for thee:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Persever in that clear way thou goest,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And the gods strengthen thee!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>

<span id='100'>For me, be you thoughten</span><br/>
<span id='101'>That I came with no ill intent; for to me</span><br/>
<span id='102'>The very doors and windows savour vilely.</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue, and</span><br/>
<span id='104'>I doubt not but thy training hath been noble.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Hold, here's more gold for thee.</span><br/>
<span id='106'>A curse upon him, die he like a thief,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Hear from me, it shall be for thy good.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter BOULT</em></p>

<span id='109'>I beseech your honour, one piece for me.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Avaunt, thou damned door-keeper!</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Your house, but for this virgin that doth prop it,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Would sink and overwhelm you. Away!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>How's this? We must take another course with you.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a</span><br/>
<span id='115'>breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded like</span><br/>
<span id='117'>a spaniel. Come your ways.</span><br/>

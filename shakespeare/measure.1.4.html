<h1>Measure for Measure</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>A nunnery.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ISABELLA and FRANCISCA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>And have you nuns no farther privileges?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>FRANCISCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Are not these large enough?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>But rather wishing a more strict restraint</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>[Within]  Ho! Peace be in this place!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Who's that which calls?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>FRANCISCA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Turn you the key, and know his business of him;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men</span><br/>
<span id='12'>But in the presence of the prioress:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>He calls again; I pray you, answer him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LUCIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me</span><br/>
<span id='19'>As bring me to the sight of Isabella,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>A novice of this place and the fair sister</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To her unhappy brother Claudio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>The rather for I now must make you know</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I am that Isabella and his sister.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Woe me! for what?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>For that which, if myself might be his judge,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>He should receive his punishment in thanks:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>He hath got his friend with child.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Sir, make me not your story.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>It is true.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>I would not&mdash;though 'tis my familiar sin</span><br/>
<span id='34'>With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Tongue far from heart&mdash;play with all virgins so:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>By your renouncement an immortal spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And to be talk'd with in sincerity,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>As with a saint.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Your brother and his lover have embraced:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time</span><br/>
<span id='44'>That from the seedness the bare fallow brings</span><br/>
<span id='45'>To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Is she your cousin?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names</span><br/>
<span id='50'>By vain though apt affection.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>She it is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>O, let him marry her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>This is the point.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>The duke is very strangely gone from hence;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>In hand and hope of action: but we do learn</span><br/>
<span id='57'>By those that know the very nerves of state,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>His givings-out were of an infinite distance</span><br/>
<span id='59'>From his true-meant design. Upon his place,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And with full line of his authority,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Is very snow-broth; one who never feels</span><br/>
<span id='63'>The wanton stings and motions of the sense,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge</span><br/>
<span id='65'>With profits of the mind, study and fast.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>He&mdash;to give fear to use and liberty,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Which have for long run by the hideous law,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>As mice by lions&mdash;hath pick'd out an act,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Under whose heavy sense your brother's life</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And follows close the rigour of the statute,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>To make him an example. All hope is gone,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer</span><br/>
<span id='74'>To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business</span><br/>
<span id='75'>'Twixt you and your poor brother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Doth he so seek his life?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Has censured him</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath</span><br/>
<span id='79'>A warrant for his execution.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Alas! what poor ability's in me</span><br/>
<span id='81'>To do him good?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>                  Assay the power you have.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>My power? Alas, I doubt&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Our doubts are traitors</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And make us lose the good we oft might win</span><br/>
<span id='86'>By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>All their petitions are as freely theirs</span><br/>
<span id='90'>As they themselves would owe them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>I'll see what I can do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>But speedily.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>I will about it straight;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>No longer staying but to give the mother</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Commend me to my brother: soon at night</span><br/>
<span id='97'>I'll send him certain word of my success.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>I take my leave of you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Good sir, adieu.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

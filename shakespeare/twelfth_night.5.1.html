<h1>Twelfth Night</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</H3>
<h4>Before Olivia's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Clown and FABIAN</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Any thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Do not desire to see this letter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>This is, to give a dog, and in recompense desire my</span><br/>
<span id='6'>dog again.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and Lords</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>I know thee well; how dost thou, my good fellow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse</span><br/>
<span id='11'>for my friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Just the contrary; the better for thy friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>No, sir, the worse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>How can that be?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by</span><br/>
<span id='17'>my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge of myself,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>and by my friends, I am abused: so that,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives</span><br/>
<span id='20'>make your two affirmatives why then, the worse for</span><br/>
<span id='21'>my friends and the better for my foes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Why, this is excellent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be</span><br/>
<span id='24'>one of my friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would</span><br/>
<span id='27'>you could make it another.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>O, you give me ill counsel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>and let your flesh and blood obey it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a</span><br/>
<span id='32'>double-dealer: there's another.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play; and the old</span><br/>
<span id='34'>saying is, the third pays for all: the triplex,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>sir, is a good tripping measure; or the bells of</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind; one, two, three.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>if you will let your lady know I am here to speak</span><br/>
<span id='39'>with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake</span><br/>
<span id='40'>my bounty further.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come</span><br/>
<span id='42'>again. I go, sir; but I would not have you to think</span><br/>
<span id='43'>that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>but, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I</span><br/>
<span id='45'>will awake it anon.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ANTONIO and Officers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>That face of his I do remember well;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd</span><br/>
<span id='49'>As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:</span><br/>
<span id='50'>A bawbling vessel was he captain of,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>For shallow draught and bulk unprizable;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>With which such scathful grapple did he make</span><br/>
<span id='53'>With the most noble bottom of our fleet,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>That very envy and the tongue of loss</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>First Officer</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Orsino, this is that Antonio</span><br/>
<span id='57'>That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And this is he that did the Tiger board,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>In private brabble did we apprehend him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>I know not what 'twas but distraction.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!</span><br/>
<span id='66'>What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Hast made thine enemies?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Orsino, noble sir,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Though I confess, on base and ground enough,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>That most ingrateful boy there by your side,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>His life I gave him and did thereto add</span><br/>
<span id='78'>My love, without retention or restraint,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>All his in dedication; for his sake</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Did I expose myself, pure for his love,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Into the danger of this adverse town;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Drew to defend him when he was beset:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Where being apprehended, his false cunning,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Not meaning to partake with me in danger,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And grew a twenty years removed thing</span><br/>
<span id='87'>While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Which I had recommended to his use</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Not half an hour before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>How can this be?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>When came he to this town?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>To-day, my lord; and for three months before,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>No interim, not a minute's vacancy,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Both day and night did we keep company.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter OLIVIA and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Three months this youth hath tended upon me;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>But more of that anon. Take him aside.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>What would my lord, but that he may not have,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Madam!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Gracious Olivia,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear</span><br/>
<span id='108'>As howling after music.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Still so cruel?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Still so constant, lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars</span><br/>
<span id='113'>My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out</span><br/>
<span id='114'>That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Kill what I love?&mdash;a savage jealousy</span><br/>
<span id='119'>That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>And that I partly know the instrument</span><br/>
<span id='122'>That screws me from my true place in your favour,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>But this your minion, whom I know you love,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:</span><br/>
<span id='129'>I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>To spite a raven's heart within a dove.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Where goes Cesario?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>After him I love</span><br/>
<span id='135'>More than I love these eyes, more than my life,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.</span><br/>
<span id='137'>If I do feign, you witnesses above</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Punish my life for tainting of my love!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Call forth the holy father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Come, away!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Husband!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>       Ay, husband: can he that deny?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Her husband, sirrah!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>No, my lord, not I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear</span><br/>
<span id='150'>That makes thee strangle thy propriety:</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art</span><br/>
<span id='153'>As great as that thou fear'st.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Priest</em></p>
<span id='154'>O, welcome, father!</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Here to unfold, though lately we intended</span><br/>
<span id='157'>To keep in darkness what occasion now</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>Priest</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>A contract of eternal bond of love,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Attested by the holy close of lips,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings;</span><br/>
<span id='164'>And all the ceremony of this compact</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Seal'd in my function, by my testimony:</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave</span><br/>
<span id='167'>I have travell'd but two hours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be</span><br/>
<span id='169'>When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>My lord, I do protest&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>O, do not swear!</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SIR ANDREW</em></p>

<span id='177'>For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently</span><br/>
<span id='178'>to Sir Toby.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='179'>What's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby</span><br/>
<span id='181'>a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your</span><br/>
<span id='182'>help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>Who has done this, Sir Andrew?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>The count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for</span><br/>
<span id='185'>a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate.</span><br/>

<span id='186'>My gentleman, Cesario?</span><br/>

<span id='speech68'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>

<span id='189'>by Sir Toby.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:</span><br/>
<span id='191'>You drew your sword upon me without cause;</span><br/>
<span id='192'>But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I</span><br/>
<span id='194'>think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown</em></p>
<span id='195'>Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more:</span><br/>
<span id='196'>but if he had not been in drink, he would have</span><br/>

<span id='speech73'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes</span><br/>
<span id='202'>were set at eight i' the morning.</span><br/>

<span id='203'>Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures panyn: I</span><br/>
<span id='204'>hate a drunken rogue.</span><br/>

<span id='215'>Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows</span><br/>
<span id='216'>We made each other but so late ago.</span><br/>

<span id='speech80'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>

<span id='227'>Most wonderful!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></a>

<span id='228'>Do I stand there? I never had a brother;</span><br/>
<span id='229'>Nor can there be that deity in my nature,</span><br/>

<span id='234'>Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;</span><br/>
<span id='235'>Such a Sebastian was my brother too,</span><br/>

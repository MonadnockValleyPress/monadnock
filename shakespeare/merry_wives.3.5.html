<h1>The Merry Wives of Windsor</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene V</h3>
<h4>A room in the Garter Inn.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Bardolph, I say,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Here, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit BARDOLPH</em></p>
<span id='4'>Have I lived to be carried in a basket, like a</span><br/>
<span id='5'>barrow of butcher's offal, and to be thrown in the</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Thames? Well, if I be served such another trick,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give</span><br/>
<span id='8'>them to a dog for a new-year's gift. The rogues</span><br/>
<span id='9'>slighted me into the river with as little remorse as</span><br/>
<span id='10'>they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>fifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my size</span><br/>
<span id='12'>that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the</span><br/>
<span id='13'>bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had</span><br/>
<span id='14'>been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and</span><br/>
<span id='15'>shallow,&mdash;a death that I abhor; for the water swells</span><br/>
<span id='16'>a man; and what a thing should I have been when I</span><br/>
<span id='17'>had been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter BARDOLPH with sack</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Let me pour in some sack to the Thames water; for my</span><br/>
<span id='20'>belly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for</span><br/>
<span id='21'>pills to cool the reins. Call her in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Come in, woman!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>By your leave; I cry you mercy: give your worship</span><br/>
<span id='24'>good morrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Take away these chalices. Go brew me a pottle of</span><br/>
<span id='26'>sack finely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>With eggs, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Simple of itself; I'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit BARDOLPH</em></p>
<span id='29'>How now!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Mistress Ford! I have had ford enough; I was thrown</span><br/>
<span id='32'>into the ford; I have my belly full of ford.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Alas the day! good heart, that was not her fault:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>she does so take on with her men; they mistook their erection.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn</span><br/>
<span id='37'>your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning</span><br/>
<span id='38'>a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her</span><br/>
<span id='39'>between eight and nine: I must carry her word</span><br/>
<span id='40'>quickly: she'll make you amends, I warrant you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Well, I will visit her: tell her so; and bid her</span><br/>
<span id='42'>think what a man is: let her consider his frailty,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>and then judge of my merit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>I will tell her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Do so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Eight and nine, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Well, be gone: I will not miss her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Peace be with you, sir.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>I marvel I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me word</span><br/>
<span id='50'>to stay within: I like his money well. O, here he comes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter FORD</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Bless you, sir!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Now, master Brook, you come to know what hath passed</span><br/>
<span id='53'>between me and Ford's wife?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Master Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at her</span><br/>
<span id='56'>house the hour she appointed me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>And sped you, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>How so, sir? Did she change her determination?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>No, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto her</span><br/>
<span id='61'>husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual</span><br/>
<span id='62'>'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our</span><br/>
<span id='63'>encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither</span><br/>
<span id='66'>provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>What, while you were there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>While I was there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>And did he search for you, and could not find you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes</span><br/>
<span id='72'>in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's</span><br/>
<span id='73'>approach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's</span><br/>
<span id='74'>distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>A buck-basket!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul</span><br/>
<span id='77'>shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy</span><br/>
<span id='78'>napkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest</span><br/>
<span id='79'>compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>And how long lay you there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have</span><br/>
<span id='82'>suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's</span><br/>
<span id='84'>knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their</span><br/>
<span id='85'>mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met</span><br/>
<span id='87'>the jealous knave their master in the door, who</span><br/>
<span id='88'>asked them once or twice what they had in their</span><br/>
<span id='89'>basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave</span><br/>
<span id='90'>would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he</span><br/>
<span id='91'>should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he</span><br/>
<span id='92'>for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But</span><br/>
<span id='93'>mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs</span><br/>
<span id='94'>of three several deaths; first, an intolerable</span><br/>
<span id='95'>fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten</span><br/>
<span id='96'>bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good</span><br/>
<span id='97'>bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to</span><br/>
<span id='98'>point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes</span><br/>
<span id='100'>that fretted in their own grease: think of that,&mdash;a</span><br/>
<span id='101'>man of my kidney,&mdash;think of that,&mdash;that am as subject</span><br/>
<span id='102'>to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution</span><br/>
<span id='103'>and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And in the height of this bath, when I was more than</span><br/>
<span id='105'>half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be</span><br/>
<span id='106'>thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of</span><br/>
<span id='108'>that,&mdash;hissing hot,&mdash;think of that, Master Brook.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you</span><br/>
<span id='110'>have sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>you'll undertake her no more?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have</span><br/>
<span id='113'>been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her</span><br/>
<span id='114'>husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have</span><br/>
<span id='115'>received from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt</span><br/>
<span id='116'>eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>'Tis past eight already, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall</span><br/>
<span id='120'>know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be</span><br/>
<span id='121'>crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall</span><br/>
<span id='122'>have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall</span><br/>
<span id='123'>cuckold Ford.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I</span><br/>
<span id='125'>sleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!</span><br/>
<span id='126'>there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.</span><br/>
<span id='127'>This 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linen</span><br/>
<span id='128'>and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself</span><br/>
<span id='129'>what I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my</span><br/>
<span id='130'>house; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he</span><br/>
<span id='131'>should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that</span><br/>
<span id='133'>guides him should aid him, I will search</span><br/>
<span id='134'>impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:</span><br/>
<span id='136'>if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go</span><br/>
<span id='137'>with me: I'll be horn-mad.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

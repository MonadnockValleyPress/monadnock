<h1>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The same. A hall of state: a banquet prepared.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, Attendants, and Knights, from tilting</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Knights,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>To say you're welcome were superfluous.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>To place upon the volume of your deeds,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>As in a title-page, your worth in arms,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Were more than you expect, or more than's fit,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Since every worth in show commends itself.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>You are princes and my guests.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>But you, my knight and guest;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To whom this wreath of victory I give,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And crown you king of this day's happiness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>'Tis more by fortune, lady, than by merit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Call it by what you will, the day is yours;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And here, I hope, is none that envies it.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>In framing an artist, art hath thus decreed,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>To make some good, but others to exceed;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And you are her labour'd scholar. Come, queen o'</span><br/>
<span id='18'>the feast,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>For, daughter, so you are,&mdash;here take your place:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KNIGHTS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>We are honour'd much by good Simonides.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Your presence glads our days: honour we love;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>For who hates honour hates the gods above.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Marshal</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Sir, yonder is your place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Some other is more fit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>First Knight</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Contend not, sir; for we are gentlemen</span><br/>
<span id='27'>That neither in our hearts nor outward eyes</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Envy the great nor do the low despise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>You are right courteous knights.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Sit, sir, sit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>By Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>These cates resist me, she but thought upon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>By Juno, that is queen of marriage,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Wishing him my meat. Sure, he's a gallant gentleman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>He's but a country gentleman;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Has done no more than other knights have done;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Has broken a staff or so; so let it pass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>To me he seems like diamond to glass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Yon king's to me like to my father's picture,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Which tells me in that glory once he was;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And he the sun, for them to reverence;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Did vail their crowns to his supremacy:</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Where now his son's like a glow-worm in the night,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Whereby I see that Time's the king of men,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>He's both their parent, and he is their grave,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And gives them what he will, not what they crave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>What, are you merry, knights?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Knights</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Who can be other in this royal presence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>As you do love, fill to your mistress' lips,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>We drink this health to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KNIGHTS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>We thank your grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Yet pause awhile:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>As if the entertainment in our court</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Had not a show might countervail his worth.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Note it not you, Thaisa?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>What is it</span><br/>
<span id='63'>To me, my father?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>                  O, attend, my daughter:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Princes in this should live like gods above,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Who freely give to every one that comes</span><br/>
<span id='67'>To honour them:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And princes not doing so are like to gnats,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Which make a sound, but kill'd are wonder'd at.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Alas, my father, it befits not me</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>He may my proffer take for an offence,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Since men take women's gifts for impudence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>How!</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>[Aside]  Now, by the gods, he could not please me better.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>And furthermore tell him, we desire to know of him,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Of whence he is, his name and parentage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>The king my father, sir, has drunk to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>I thank him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Wishing it so much blood unto your life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>And further he desires to know of you,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Of whence you are, your name and parentage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>A gentleman of Tyre; my name, Pericles;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>My education been in arts and arms;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Who, looking for adventures in the world,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And after shipwreck driven upon this shore.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>He thanks your grace; names himself Pericles,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>A gentleman of Tyre,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Who only by misfortune of the seas</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And will awake him from his melancholy.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And waste the time, which looks for other revels.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Even in your armours, as you are address'd,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Will very well become a soldier's dance.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>I will not have excuse, with saying this</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Since they love men in arms as well as beds.</span><br/>
<p><em>The Knights dance</em></p>
<span id='105'>So, this was well ask'd,'twas so well perform'd.</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Come, sir;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Here is a lady that wants breathing too:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And I have heard, you knights of Tyre</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Are excellent in making ladies trip;</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And that their measures are as excellent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>In those that practise them they are, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>O, that's as much as you would be denied</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Of your fair courtesy.</span><br/>
<p><em>The Knights and Ladies dance</em></p>
<span id='114'>Unclasp, unclasp:</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well.</span><br/>
<p><em>To PERICLES</em></p>
<span id='116'>But you the best. Pages and lights, to conduct</span><br/>
<span id='117'>These knights unto their several lodgings!</span><br/>
<p><em>To PERICLES</em></p>
<span id='118'>Yours, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>We have given order to be next our own.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>I am at your grace's pleasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Princes, it is too late to talk of love;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And that's the mark I know you level at:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Therefore each one betake him to his rest;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>To-morrow all for speeding do their best.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

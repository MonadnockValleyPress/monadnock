<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The Florentine camp.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>You have not given him his mother's letter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>I have delivered it an hour since: there is</span><br/>
<span id='3'>something in't that stings his nature; for on the</span><br/>
<span id='4'>reading it he changed almost into another man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking</span><br/>
<span id='6'>off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Especially he hath incurred the everlasting</span><br/>
<span id='8'>displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his</span><br/>
<span id='9'>bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a</span><br/>
<span id='10'>thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the</span><br/>
<span id='12'>grave of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he</span><br/>
<span id='15'>fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath</span><br/>
<span id='16'>given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself</span><br/>
<span id='17'>made in the unchaste composition.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>what things are we!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course</span><br/>
<span id='21'>of all treasons, we still see them reveal</span><br/>
<span id='22'>themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>so he that in this action contrives against his own</span><br/>
<span id='24'>nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of</span><br/>
<span id='26'>our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his</span><br/>
<span id='27'>company to-night?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see</span><br/>
<span id='30'>his company anatomized, that he might take a measure</span><br/>
<span id='31'>of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had</span><br/>
<span id='32'>set this counterfeit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>We will not meddle with him till he come; for his</span><br/>
<span id='34'>presence must be the whip of the other.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>I hear there is an overture of peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel</span><br/>
<span id='39'>higher, or return again into France?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether</span><br/>
<span id='41'>of his council.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal</span><br/>
<span id='43'>of his act.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his</span><br/>
<span id='45'>house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques</span><br/>
<span id='46'>le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere</span><br/>
<span id='47'>sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the</span><br/>
<span id='48'>tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her</span><br/>
<span id='49'>grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and</span><br/>
<span id='50'>now she sings in heaven.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>How is this justified?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>The stronger part of it by her own letters, which</span><br/>
<span id='53'>makes her story true, even to the point of her</span><br/>
<span id='54'>death: her death itself, which could not be her</span><br/>
<span id='55'>office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by</span><br/>
<span id='56'>the rector of the place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Hath the count all this intelligence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from</span><br/>
<span id='59'>point, so to the full arming of the verity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>And how mightily some other times we drown our gain</span><br/>
<span id='63'>in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath</span><br/>
<span id='64'>here acquired for him shall at home be encountered</span><br/>
<span id='65'>with a shame as ample.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and</span><br/>
<span id='67'>ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our</span><br/>
<span id='68'>faults whipped them not; and our crimes would</span><br/>
<span id='69'>despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
<span id='70'>How now! where's your master?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath</span><br/>
<span id='72'>taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next</span><br/>
<span id='73'>morning for France. The duke hath offered him</span><br/>
<span id='74'>letters of commendations to the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>They shall be no more than needful there, if they</span><br/>
<span id='76'>were more than they can commend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Here's his lordship now.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BERTRAM</em></p>
<span id='79'>How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a</span><br/>
<span id='81'>month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his</span><br/>
<span id='83'>nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my</span><br/>
<span id='84'>lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>and between these main parcels of dispatch effected</span><br/>
<span id='86'>many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but</span><br/>
<span id='87'>that I have not ended yet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>If the business be of any difficulty, and this</span><br/>
<span id='89'>morning your departure hence, it requires haste of</span><br/>
<span id='90'>your lordship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to</span><br/>
<span id='92'>hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this</span><br/>
<span id='93'>dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived</span><br/>
<span id='95'>me, like a double-meaning prophesier.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>poor gallant knave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping</span><br/>
<span id='99'>his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry</span><br/>
<span id='101'>him. But to answer you as you would be understood;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he</span><br/>
<span id='103'>hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes</span><br/>
<span id='104'>to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to</span><br/>
<span id='105'>this very instant disaster of his setting i' the</span><br/>
<span id='106'>stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Nothing of me, has a'?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his</span><br/>
<span id='109'>face: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you</span><br/>
<span id='110'>are, you must have the patience to hear it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PAROLLES guarded, and First Soldier</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of</span><br/>
<span id='112'>me: hush, hush!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Hoodman comes! Portotartarosa</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>First Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>He calls for the tortures: what will you say</span><br/>
<span id='115'>without 'em?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I will confess what I know without constraint: if</span><br/>
<span id='117'>ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>First Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Bosko chimurcho.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Boblibindo chicurmurco.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>First Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>You are a merciful general. Our general bids you</span><br/>
<span id='121'>answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>And truly, as I hope to live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>First Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>[Reads]  'First demand of him how many horse the</span><br/>
<span id='124'>duke is strong.' What say you to that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Five or six thousand; but very weak and</span><br/>
<span id='126'>unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and</span><br/>
<span id='127'>the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation</span><br/>
<span id='128'>and credit and as I hope to live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>First Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Shall I set down your answer so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>

<span id='130'>Do: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Parolles, the gallant militarist,&mdash;that was his own</span><br/>
<span id='134'>phrase,&mdash;that had the whole theoric of war in the</span><br/>
<span id='135'>knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of</span><br/>
<span id='136'>his dagger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword</span><br/>
<span id='138'>clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him</span><br/>
<span id='139'>by wearing his apparel neatly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>First Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Well, that's set down.</span><br/>

<span id='141'>Five or six thousand horse, I said,&mdash; I will say</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>He's very near the truth in this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he</span><br/>
<span id='145'>delivers it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='146'>Poor rogues, I pray you, say.</span><br/>

<span id='147'>Well, that's set down.</span><br/>

<span id='speech60'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>

<span id='148'>I humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the</span><br/>
<span id='149'>rogues are marvellous poor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>First Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>[Reads]  'Demand of him, of what strength they are</span><br/>
<span id='151'>a-foot.' What say you to that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present</span><br/>
<span id='153'>hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a</span><br/>
<span id='154'>hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so</span><br/>
<span id='155'>many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own</span><br/>
<span id='157'>company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and</span><br/>
<span id='158'>fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and</span><br/>
<span id='159'>sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand</span><br/>
<span id='160'>poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off</span><br/>
<span id='161'>their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>What shall be done to him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>

<span id='163'>Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my</span><br/>
<span id='164'>condition, and what credit I have with the duke.</span><br/>

<span id='169'>expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not</span><br/>
<span id='170'>possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to</span><br/>
<span id='171'>corrupt him to revolt.' What say you to this? what</span><br/>

<span id='236'>He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for</span><br/>
<span id='237'>rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he</span><br/>
<span id='238'>professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he</span><br/>
<span id='239'>is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with</span><br/>
<span id='240'>such volubility, that you would think truth were a</span><br/>
<span id='241'>fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will</span><br/>
<span id='242'>be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little</span><br/>
<span id='243'>harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they</span><br/>
<span id='244'>know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but</span><br/>
<span id='245'>little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has</span><br/>

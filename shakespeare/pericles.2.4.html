<h1>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Tyre. A room in the Governor's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>No, Escanes, know this of me,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Antiochus from incest lived not free:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>For which, the most high gods not minding longer</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To withhold the vengeance that they had in store,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Due to this heinous capital offence,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Even in the height and pride of all his glory,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>When he was seated in a chariot</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>A fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Their bodies, even to loathing; for they so stunk,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>That all those eyes adored them ere their fall</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Scorn now their hand should give them burial.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ESCANES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>'Twas very strange.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>And yet but justice; for though</span><br/>
<span id='15'>This king were great, his greatness was no guard</span><br/>
<span id='16'>To bar heaven's shaft, but sin had his reward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ESCANES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>'Tis very true.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter two or three Lords</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>See, not a man in private conference</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Or council has respect with him but he.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>It shall no longer grieve without reproof.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Third Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>And cursed be he that will not second it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Follow me, then. Lord Helicane, a word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>With me? and welcome: happy day, my lords.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Know that our griefs are risen to the top,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And now at length they overflow their banks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Your griefs! for what? wrong not your prince you love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Wrong not yourself, then, noble Helicane;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>But if the prince do live, let us salute him,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>If in the world he live, we'll seek him out;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>If in his grave he rest, we'll find him there;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And be resolved he lives to govern us,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Or dead, give's cause to mourn his funeral,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And leave us to our free election.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Whose death indeed's the strongest in our censure:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And knowing this kingdom is without a head,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Like goodly buildings left without a roof</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Soon fall to ruin,&mdash;your noble self,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>That best know how to rule and how to reign,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>We thus submit unto,&mdash;our sovereign.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Live, noble Helicane!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>For honour's cause, forbear your suffrages:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>A twelvemonth longer, let me entreat you to</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Forbear the absence of your king:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>If in which time expired, he not return,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>But if I cannot win you to this love,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And in your search spend your adventurous worth;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Whom if you find, and win unto return,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>To wisdom he's a fool that will not yield;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>We with our travels will endeavour us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

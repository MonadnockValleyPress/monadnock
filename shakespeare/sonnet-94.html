<h3>XCIV</h3>
<p>
They that have power to hurt, and will do none,<br/>
That do not do the thing they most do show,<br/>
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,<br/>
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;<br/>
They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,<br/>
And husband nature's riches from expense;<br/>
They are the lords and owners of their faces,<br/>
Others, but stewards of their excellence.<br/>
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,<br/>
Though to itself, it only live and die,<br/>
But if that flower with base infection meet,<br/>
The basest weed outbraves his dignity: <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.<br/>

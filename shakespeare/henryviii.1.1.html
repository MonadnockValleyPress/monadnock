<h1>Henry VIII</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>London. An ante-chamber in the palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter NORFOLK at one door; at the other, BUCKINGHAM and ABERGAVENNY</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Since last we saw in France?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>I thank your grace,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Of what I saw there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>An untimely ague</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Met in the vale of Andren.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>'Twixt Guynes and Arde:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung</span><br/>
<span id='13'>In their embracement, as they grew together;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Such a compounded one?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>All the whole time</span><br/>
<span id='17'>I was my chamber's prisoner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Then you lost</span><br/>
<span id='19'>The view of earthly glory: men might say,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Till this time pomp was single, but now married</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To one above itself. Each following day</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Became the next day's master, till the last</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Made former wonders its. To-day the French,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Made Britain India: every man that stood</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were</span><br/>
<span id='28'>As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear</span><br/>
<span id='30'>The pride upon them, that their very labour</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Was to them as a painting: now this masque</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>As presence did present them; him in eye,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Still him in praise: and, being present both</span><br/>
<span id='37'>'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>For so they phrase 'em&mdash;by their heralds challenged</span><br/>
<span id='40'>The noble spirits to arms, they did perform</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Being now seen possible enough, got credit,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>That Bevis was believed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>O, you go far.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>As I belong to worship and affect</span><br/>
<span id='46'>In honour honesty, the tract of every thing</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Would by a good discourser lose some life,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>To the disposing of it nought rebell'd.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Order gave each thing view; the office did</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Distinctly his full function.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Who did guide,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>I mean, who set the body and the limbs</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Of this great sport together, as you guess?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>One, certes, that promises no element</span><br/>
<span id='56'>In such a business.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>I pray you, who, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>All this was order'd by the good discretion</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed</span><br/>
<span id='61'>From his ambitious finger. What had he</span><br/>
<span id='62'>To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder</span><br/>
<span id='63'>That such a keech can with his very bulk</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And keep it from the earth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Surely, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon</span><br/>
<span id='70'>For high feats done to the crown; neither allied</span><br/>
<span id='71'>For eminent assistants; but, spider-like,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>The force of his own merit makes his way</span><br/>
<span id='74'>A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys</span><br/>
<span id='75'>A place next to the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ABERGAVENNY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>I cannot tell</span><br/>
<span id='77'>What heaven hath given him,&mdash;let some graver eye</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Pierce into that; but I can see his pride</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Or has given all before, and he begins</span><br/>
<span id='82'>A new hell in himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Why the devil,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Upon this French going out, took he upon him,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Without the privity o' the king, to appoint</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Who should attend on him? He makes up the file</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Of all the gentry; for the most part such</span><br/>
<span id='88'>To whom as great a charge as little honour</span><br/>
<span id='89'>He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>The honourable board of council out,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Must fetch him in the papers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ABERGAVENNY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>I do know</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have</span><br/>
<span id='94'>By this so sickened their estates, that never</span><br/>
<span id='95'>They shall abound as formerly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>O, many</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em</span><br/>
<span id='98'>For this great journey. What did this vanity</span><br/>
<span id='99'>But minister communication of</span><br/>
<span id='100'>A most poor issue?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>                  Grievingly I think,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>The peace between the French and us not values</span><br/>
<span id='103'>The cost that did conclude it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Every man,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>After the hideous storm that follow'd, was</span><br/>
<span id='106'>A thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Into a general prophecy; that this tempest,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded</span><br/>
<span id='109'>The sudden breach on't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Which is budded out;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ABERGAVENNY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Is it therefore</span><br/>
<span id='114'>The ambassador is silenced?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Marry, is't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ABERGAVENNY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>A proper title of a peace; and purchased</span><br/>
<span id='117'>At a superfluous rate!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Why, all this business</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Our reverend cardinal carried.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Like it your grace,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>The state takes notice of the private difference</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>And take it from a heart that wishes towards you</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Honour and plenteous safety&mdash;that you read</span><br/>
<span id='125'>The cardinal's malice and his potency</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Together; to consider further that</span><br/>
<span id='127'>What his high hatred would effect wants not</span><br/>
<span id='128'>A minister in his power. You know his nature,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>That he's revengeful, and I know his sword</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Hath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock</span><br/>
<span id='134'>That I advise your shunning.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before him,  certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries with  papers. CARDINAL WOLSEY in his passage fixeth his  eye on BUCKINGHAM, and BUCKINGHAM on him, both full of disdain</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Where's his examination?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>First Secretary</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Here, so please you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Is he in person ready?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>First Secretary</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Ay, please your grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Well, we shall then know more; and Buckingham</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Shall lessen this big look.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt CARDINAL WOLSEY and his Train</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Outworths a noble's blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>What, are you chafed?</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance only</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Which your disease requires.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>I read in's looks</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Matter against me; and his eye reviled</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Me, as his abject object: at this instant</span><br/>
<span id='152'>He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king;</span><br/>
<span id='153'>I'll follow and outstare him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Stay, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>And let your reason with your choler question</span><br/>
<span id='156'>What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Requires slow pace at first: anger is like</span><br/>
<span id='158'>A full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Can advise me like you: be to yourself</span><br/>
<span id='161'>As you would to your friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>I'll to the king;</span><br/>
<span id='163'>And from a mouth of honour quite cry down</span><br/>
<span id='164'>This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim</span><br/>
<span id='165'>There's difference in no persons.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Be advised;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot</span><br/>
<span id='168'>That it do singe yourself: we may outrun,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>By violent swiftness, that which we run at,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>And lose by over-running. Know you not,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>The fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised:</span><br/>
<span id='173'>I say again, there is no English soul</span><br/>
<span id='174'>More stronger to direct you than yourself,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>If with the sap of reason you would quench,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Or but allay, the fire of passion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>Sir,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>I am thankful to you; and I'll go along</span><br/>
<span id='179'>By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Whom from the flow of gall I name not but</span><br/>
<span id='181'>From sincere motions, by intelligence,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>And proofs as clear as founts in July when</span><br/>
<span id='183'>We see each grain of gravel, I do know</span><br/>
<span id='184'>To be corrupt and treasonous.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>Say not 'treasonous.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>To the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strong</span><br/>
<span id='187'>As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Or wolf, or both,&mdash;for he is equal ravenous</span><br/>
<span id='189'>As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief</span><br/>
<span id='190'>As able to perform't; his mind and place</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Only to show his pomp as well in France</span><br/>
<span id='193'>As here at home, suggests the king our master</span><br/>
<span id='194'>To this last costly treaty, the interview,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Did break i' the rinsing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>Faith, and so it did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal</span><br/>
<span id='199'>The articles o' the combination drew</span><br/>
<span id='200'>As himself pleased; and they were ratified</span><br/>
<span id='201'>As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end</span><br/>
<span id='202'>As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy</span><br/>
<span id='206'>To the old dam, treason,&mdash;Charles the emperor,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Under pretence to see the queen his aunt&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='208'>For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came</span><br/>
<span id='209'>To whisper Wolsey,&mdash;here makes visitation:</span><br/>
<span id='210'>His fears were, that the interview betwixt</span><br/>
<span id='211'>England and France might, through their amity,</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Breed him some prejudice; for from this league</span><br/>
<span id='213'>Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor</span><br/>
<span id='216'>Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted</span><br/>
<span id='217'>Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,</span><br/>
<span id='218'>And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>That he would please to alter the king's course,</span><br/>
<span id='220'>And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,</span><br/>
<span id='221'>As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal</span><br/>
<span id='222'>Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,</span><br/>
<span id='223'>And for his own advantage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='224'>I am sorry</span><br/>
<span id='225'>To hear this of him; and could wish he were</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Something mistaken in't.</span><br/>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='227'>No, not a syllable:</span><br/>

<span id='229'>He shall appear in proof.</span><br/>

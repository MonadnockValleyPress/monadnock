<h1>Measure for Measure</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</H3>
<h4>The city gate.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>MARIANA veiled, ISABELLA, and FRIAR PETER, at their  stand. Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, VARRIUS, Lords,  ANGELO, ESCALUS, LUCIO, Provost, Officers, and Citizens, at several doors</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>My very worthy cousin, fairly met!</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Happy return be to your royal grace!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Many and hearty thankings to you both.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>We have made inquiry of you; and we hear</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Such goodness of your justice, that our soul</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Forerunning more requital.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>You make my bonds still greater.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>When it deserves, with characters of brass,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And let the subject see, to make them know</span><br/>
<span id='16'>That outward courtesies would fain proclaim</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>You must walk by us on our other hand;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And good supporters are you.</span><br/>
<p><em>FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>FRIAR PETER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!</span><br/>
<span id='23'>O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye</span><br/>
<span id='24'>By throwing it on any other object</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Till you have heard me in my true complaint</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Reveal yourself to him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>O worthy duke,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>You bid me seek redemption of the devil:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Must either punish me, not being believed,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>She hath been a suitor to me for her brother</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Cut off by course of justice,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>By course of justice!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>And she will speak most bitterly and strange.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?</span><br/>
<span id='42'>That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?</span><br/>
<span id='43'>That Angelo is an adulterous thief,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Is it not strange and strange?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Nay, it is ten times strange.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>It is not truer he is Angelo</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Than this is all as true as it is strange:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth</span><br/>
<span id='50'>To the end of reckoning.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Away with her! Poor soul,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest</span><br/>
<span id='54'>There is another comfort than this world,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>That thou neglect me not, with that opinion</span><br/>
<span id='56'>That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible</span><br/>
<span id='57'>That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible</span><br/>
<span id='58'>But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute</span><br/>
<span id='60'>As Angelo; even so may Angelo,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Had I more name for badness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>By mine honesty,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>If she be mad,&mdash;as I believe no other,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Such a dependency of thing on thing,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>As e'er I heard in madness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>O gracious duke,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason</span><br/>
<span id='72'>For inequality; but let your reason serve</span><br/>
<span id='73'>To make the truth appear where it seems hid,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And hide the false seems true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Many that are not mad</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>I am the sister of one Claudio,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Condemn'd upon the act of fornication</span><br/>
<span id='79'>To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I, in probation of a sisterhood,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio</span><br/>
<span id='82'>As then the messenger,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>That's I, an't like your grace:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>I came to her from Claudio, and desired her</span><br/>
<span id='85'>To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo</span><br/>
<span id='86'>For her poor brother's pardon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>That's he indeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>You were not bid to speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>No, my good lord;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Nor wish'd to hold my peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>I wish you now, then;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Pray you, take note of it: and when you have</span><br/>
<span id='93'>A business for yourself, pray heaven you then</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Be perfect.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>I warrant your honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Right.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>It may be right; but you are i' the wrong</span><br/>
<span id='100'>To speak before your time. Proceed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>I went</span><br/>
<span id='102'>To this pernicious caitiff deputy,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>That's somewhat madly spoken.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Pardon it;</span><br/>
<span id='105'>The phrase is to the matter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Mended again. The matter; proceed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>In brief, to set the needless process by,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>How he refell'd me, and how I replied,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='110'>For this was of much length,&mdash;the vile conclusion</span><br/>
<span id='111'>I now begin with grief and shame to utter:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>He would not, but by gift of my chaste body</span><br/>
<span id='113'>To his concupiscible intemperate lust,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Release my brother; and, after much debatement,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant</span><br/>
<span id='118'>For my poor brother's head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>This is most likely!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>O, that it were as like as it is true!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour</span><br/>
<span id='123'>In hateful practise. First, his integrity</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason</span><br/>
<span id='125'>That with such vehemency he should pursue</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself</span><br/>
<span id='128'>And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Confess the truth, and say by whose advice</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Thou camest here to complain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>And is this all?</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Then, O you blessed ministers above,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up</span><br/>
<span id='135'>In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!</span><br/>
<span id='138'>To prison with her! Shall we thus permit</span><br/>
<span id='139'>A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall</span><br/>
<span id='140'>On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;</span><br/>
<span id='145'>I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord</span><br/>
<span id='146'>For certain words he spake against your grace</span><br/>
<span id='147'>In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!</span><br/>
<span id='149'>And to set on this wretched woman here</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>A very scurvy fellow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>FRIAR PETER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Blessed be your royal grace!</span><br/>
<span id='155'>I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Most wrongfully accused your substitute,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Who is as free from touch or soil with her</span><br/>
<span id='159'>As she from one ungot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>We did believe no less.</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>FRIAR PETER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>I know him for a man divine and holy;</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>As he's reported by this gentleman;</span><br/>
<span id='165'>And, on my trust, a man that never yet</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>My lord, most villanously; believe it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>FRIAR PETER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Well, he in time may come to clear himself;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>But at this instant he is sick my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Being come to knowledge that there was complaint</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Is true and false; and what he with his oath</span><br/>
<span id='175'>And all probation will make up full clear,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.</span><br/>
<span id='177'>To justify this worthy nobleman,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>So vulgarly and personally accused,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Till she herself confess it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>Good friar, let's hear it.</span><br/>
<p><em>ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forward</em></p>
<span id='182'>Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?</span><br/>
<span id='183'>O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;</span><br/>
<span id='185'>In this I'll be impartial; be you judge</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?</span><br/>
<span id='187'>First, let her show her face, and after speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>MARIANA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Until my husband bid me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>What, are you married?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>MARIANA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>No, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Are you a maid?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>MARIANA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>No, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>A widow, then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>MARIANA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>Neither, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are</span><br/>
<span id='198'>neither maid, widow, nor wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause</span><br/>
<span id='200'>To prattle for himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>Well, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>MARIANA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;</span><br/>
<span id='203'>And I confess besides I am no maid:</span><br/>
<span id='204'>I have known my husband; yet my husband</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Knows not that ever he knew me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='207'>For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>Well, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='209'>This is no witness for Lord Angelo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>MARIANA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>Now I come to't my lord</span><br/>
<span id='211'>She that accuses him of fornication,</span><br/>
<span id='212'>In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>And charges him my lord, with such a time</span><br/>
<span id='214'>When I'll depose I had him in mine arms</span><br/>
<span id='215'>With all the effect of love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>Charges she more than me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>MARIANA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>Not that I know.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>No? you say your husband.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>MARIANA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='219'>Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,</span><br/>
<span id='220'>Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,</span><br/>
<span id='221'>But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='222'>This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>MARIANA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='223'>My husband bids me; now I will unmask.</span><br/>
<p><em>Unveiling</em></p>
<span id='224'>This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;</span><br/>
<span id='226'>This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,</span><br/>
<span id='227'>Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body</span><br/>
<span id='228'>That took away the match from Isabel,</span><br/>
<span id='229'>And did supply thee at thy garden-house</span><br/>
<span id='230'>In her imagined person.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='231'>Know you this woman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='232'>Carnally, she says.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='233'>Sirrah, no more!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='234'>Enough, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='235'>My lord, I must confess I know this woman:</span><br/>
<span id='236'>And five years since there was some speech of marriage</span><br/>
<span id='237'>Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,</span><br/>
<span id='238'>Partly for that her promised proportions</span><br/>
<span id='239'>Came short of composition, but in chief</span><br/>
<span id='240'>For that her reputation was disvalued</span><br/>
<span id='241'>In levity: since which time of five years</span><br/>
<span id='242'>I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,</span><br/>
<span id='243'>Upon my faith and honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>MARIANA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='244'>Noble prince,</span><br/>
<span id='245'>As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,</span><br/>
<span id='246'>As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,</span><br/>
<span id='247'>I am affianced this man's wife as strongly</span><br/>
<span id='248'>As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,</span><br/>
<span id='249'>But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house</span><br/>

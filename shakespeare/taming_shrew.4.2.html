<h1>Taming of the Shrew</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Padua. Before Baptista's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter TRANIO and HORTENSIO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?</span><br/>
<span id='3'>I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BIANCA and LUCENTIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>What, master, read you? first resolve me that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>I read that I profess, the Art to Love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>And may you prove, sir, master of your art!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!</span><br/>
<span id='15'>I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Mistake no more: I am not Licio,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Nor a musician, as I seem to be;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>But one that scorn to live in this disguise,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>For such a one as leaves a gentleman,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And makes a god of such a cullion:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Signior Hortensio, I have often heard</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Of your entire affection to Bianca;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>I will with you, if you be so contented,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>As one unworthy all the former favours</span><br/>
<span id='31'>That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>And here I take the unfeigned oath,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Never to marry with her though she would entreat:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!</span><br/>
<span id='36'>For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>I will be married to a wealthy widow,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me</span><br/>
<span id='39'>As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>In resolution as I swore before.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace</span><br/>
<span id='45'>As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And have forsworn you with Hortensio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Mistress, we have.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>                  Then we are rid of Licio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>That shall be wood and wedded in a day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>God give him joy!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Ay, and he'll tame her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>He says so, Tranio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>The taming-school! what, is there such a place?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BIONDELLO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>O master, master, I have watch'd so long</span><br/>
<span id='62'>That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied</span><br/>
<span id='63'>An ancient angel coming down the hill,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Will serve the turn.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>What is he, Biondello?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>I know not what; but format in apparel,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>In gait and countenance surely like a father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>And what of him, Tranio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>If he be credulous and trust my tale,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And give assurance to Baptista Minola,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>As if he were the right Vincentio</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Take in your love, and then let me alone.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA</em></p>
<p><em>Enter a Pedant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Pedant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>God save you, sir!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>                  And you, sir! you are welcome.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Pedant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>But then up farther, and as for as Rome;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>What countryman, I pray?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>Pedant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Of Mantua.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And come to Padua, careless of your life?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Pedant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>'Tis death for any one in Mantua</span><br/>
<span id='87'>To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:</span><br/>
<span id='91'>'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Pedant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>For I have bills for money by exchange</span><br/>
<span id='95'>From Florence and must here deliver them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Well, sir, to do you courtesy,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>This will I do, and this I will advise you:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Pedant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Pisa renowned for grave citizens.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Among them know you one Vincentio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Pedant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>I know him not, but I have heard of him;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>A merchant of incomparable wealth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>[Aside]  As much as an apple doth an oyster,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>and all one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>To save your life in this extremity,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>This favour will I do you for his sake;</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And think it not the worst of an your fortunes</span><br/>
<span id='111'>That you are like to Sir Vincentio.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>His name and credit shall you undertake,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Look that you take upon you as you should;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>You understand me, sir: so shall you stay</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Till you have done your business in the city:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Pedant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>O sir, I do; and will repute you ever</span><br/>
<span id='119'>The patron of my life and liberty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Then go with me to make the matter good.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>This, by the way, I let you understand;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>my father is here look'd for every day,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>To pass assurance of a dower in marriage</span><br/>
<span id='124'>'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!</span><br/>
<span id='2'>False blood to false blood join'd! gone to be friends!</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?</span><br/>
<span id='4'>It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>It cannot be; thou dost but say 'tis so:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>I trust I may not trust thee; for thy word</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Is but the vain breath of a common man:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Believe me, I do not believe thee, man;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>I have a king's oath to the contrary.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>For I am sick and capable of fears,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>A woman, naturally born to fears;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>But they will quake and tremble all this day.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?</span><br/>
<span id='21'>What means that hand upon that breast of thine?</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Then speak again; not all thy former tale,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>But this one word, whether thy tale be true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>As true as I believe you think them false</span><br/>
<span id='28'>That give you cause to prove my saying true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And let belief and life encounter so</span><br/>
<span id='32'>As doth the fury of two desperate men</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Which in the very meeting fall and die.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Lewis marry Blanch! O boy, then where art thou?</span><br/>
<span id='35'>France friend with England, what becomes of me?</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Fellow, be gone: I cannot brook thy sight:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>This news hath made thee a most ugly man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>What other harm have I, good lady, done,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>But spoke the harm that is by others done?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Which harm within itself so heinous is</span><br/>
<span id='41'>As it makes harmful all that speak of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>I do beseech you, madam, be content.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>I would not care, I then would be content,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>For then I should not love thee, no, nor thou</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.</span><br/>
<span id='51'>But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>She is corrupted, changed and won from thee;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France</span><br/>
<span id='58'>To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Envenom him with words, or get thee gone</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And leave those woes alone which I alone</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Am bound to under-bear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Pardon me, madam,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>I may not go without you to the kings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>I will instruct my sorrows to be proud;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>To me and to the state of my great grief</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great</span><br/>
<span id='73'>That no supporter but the huge firm earth</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Seats herself on the ground</em></p>
<p><em>Enter KING JOHN, KING PHILLIP, LEWIS, BLANCH, QUEEN ELINOR, the BASTARD, AUSTRIA, and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>'Tis true, fair daughter; and this blessed day</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Ever in France shall be kept festival:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>To solemnize this day the glorious sun</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Turning with splendor of his precious eye</span><br/>
<span id='81'>The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>The yearly course that brings this day about</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Shall never see it but a holiday.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>A wicked day, and not a holy day!</span><br/>
<p><em>Rising</em></p>
<span id='85'>What hath this day deserved? what hath it done,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>That it in golden letters should be set</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Among the high tides in the calendar?</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>This day of shame, oppression, perjury.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Pray that their burthens may not fall this day,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>No bargains break that are not this day made:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>This day, all things begun come to ill end,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause</span><br/>
<span id='98'>To curse the fair proceedings of this day:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>You have beguiled me with a counterfeit</span><br/>

<span id='102'>Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>But now in arms you strengthen it with yours:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>The grappling vigour and rough frown of war</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Is cold in amity and painted peace,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And our oppression hath made up this league.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured kings!</span><br/>
<span id='109'>A widow cries; be husband to me, heavens!</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Let not the hours of this ungodly day</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Set armed discord 'twixt these perjured kings!</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Hear me, O, hear me!</span><br/>

<span id='119'>Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight</span><br/>
<span id='121'>But when her humorous ladyship is by</span><br/>
<span id='122'>To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>And soothest up greatness. What a fool art thou,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And dost thou now fall over to my foes?</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame,</span><br/>

<span id='141'>And from Pope Innocent the legate here,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Do in his name religiously demand</span><br/>

<span id='152'>So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>To charge me to an answer, as the pope.</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Add thus much more, that no Italian priest</span><br/>

<span id='275'>For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss</span><br/>
<span id='276'>Is not amiss when it is truly done,</span><br/>
<span id='277'>And being not done, where doing tends to ill,</span><br/>
<span id='278'>The truth is then most done not doing it:</span><br/>
<span id='279'>The better act of purposes mistook</span><br/>
<span id='280'>Is to mistake again; though indirect,</span><br/>
<span id='281'>Yet indirection thereby grows direct,</span><br/>
<span id='282'>And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire</span><br/>
<span id='283'>Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.</span><br/>
<span id='284'>It is religion that doth make vows kept;</span><br/>
<span id='285'>But thou hast sworn against religion,</span><br/>
<span id='286'>By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,</span><br/>
<span id='287'>And makest an oath the surety for thy truth</span><br/>
<span id='288'>Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure</span><br/>
<span id='289'>To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;</span><br/>
<span id='290'>Else what a mockery should it be to swear!</span><br/>
<span id='291'>But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;</span><br/>
<span id='292'>And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.</span><br/>
<span id='293'>Therefore thy later vows against thy first</span><br/>
<span id='294'>Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;</span><br/>
<span id='295'>And better conquest never canst thou make</span><br/>
<span id='296'>Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts</span><br/>
<span id='297'>Against these giddy loose suggestions:</span><br/>
<span id='298'>Upon which better part our prayers come in,</span><br/>
<span id='299'>If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know</span><br/>
<span id='300'>The peril of our curses light on thee</span><br/>
<span id='301'>So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,</span><br/>
<span id='302'>But in despair die under their black weight.</span><br/>

<h1>Hamlet</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>A plain in Denmark.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter FORTINBRAS, a Captain, and Soldiers, marching</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Craves the conveyance of a promised march</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>If that his majesty would aught with us,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>We shall express our duty in his eye;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And let him know so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>I will do't, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Go softly on.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt FORTINBRAS and Soldiers</em></p>
<p><em>Enter HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Good sir, whose powers are these?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>They are of Norway, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>How purposed, sir, I pray you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Against some part of Poland.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Who commands them, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Or for some frontier?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Truly to speak, and with no addition,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>We go to gain a little patch of ground</span><br/>
<span id='20'>That hath in it no profit but the name.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole</span><br/>
<span id='23'>A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Why, then the Polack never will defend it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Yes, it is already garrison'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Will not debate the question of this straw:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>That inward breaks, and shows no cause without</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>God be wi' you, sir.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Wilt please you go, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>I'll be with you straight go a little before.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all except HAMLET</em></p>
<span id='34'>How all occasions do inform against me,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>If his chief good and market of his time</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Looking before and after, gave us not</span><br/>
<span id='40'>That capability and god-like reason</span><br/>
<span id='41'>To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Of thinking too precisely on the event,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And ever three parts coward, I do not know</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Sith I have cause and will and strength and means</span><br/>
<span id='48'>To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Witness this army of such mass and charge</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Led by a delicate and tender prince,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Makes mouths at the invisible event,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Exposing what is mortal and unsure</span><br/>
<span id='54'>To all that fortune, death and danger dare,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Is not to stir without great argument,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>But greatly to find quarrel in a straw</span><br/>
<span id='58'>When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Excitements of my reason and my blood,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see</span><br/>
<span id='62'>The imminent death of twenty thousand men,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Which is not tomb enough and continent</span><br/>
<span id='67'>To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

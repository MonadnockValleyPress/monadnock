<h1>Titus Andronicus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>The same. Before the palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter SATURNINUS, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON,  Lords, and others; SATURNINUS with the arrows in his hand that TITUS shot</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Why, lords, what wrongs are these! was ever seen</span><br/>
<span id='2'>An emperor in Rome thus overborne,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Of egal justice, used in such contempt?</span><br/>
<span id='5'>My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>However these disturbers of our peace</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Buzz in the people's ears, there nought hath pass'd,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>But even with law, against the willful sons</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Of old Andronicus. And what an if</span><br/>
<span id='10'>His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And now he writes to heaven for his redress:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>This to Apollo; this to the god of war;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!</span><br/>
<span id='17'>What's this but libelling against the senate,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And blazoning our injustice every where?</span><br/>
<span id='19'>A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?</span><br/>
<span id='20'>As who would say, in Rome no justice were.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>But if I live, his feigned ecstasies</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Shall be no shelter to these outrages:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>But he and his shall know that justice lives</span><br/>
<span id='24'>In Saturninus' health, whom, if she sleep,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>He'll so awake as she in fury shall</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr'd his heart;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And rather comfort his distressed plight</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Than prosecute the meanest or the best</span><br/>
<span id='34'>For these contempts.</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='35'>Why, thus it shall become</span><br/>
<span id='36'>High-witted Tamora to gloze with all:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Thy life-blood out: if Aaron now be wise,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Then is all safe, the anchor's in the port.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Clown</em></p>
<span id='40'>How now, good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Yea, forsooth, an your mistership be emperial.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Empress I am, but yonder sits the emperor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>'Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you good den:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.</span><br/>
<p><em>SATURNINUS reads the letter</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Go, take him away, and hang him presently.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>How much money must I have?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Come, sirrah, you must be hanged.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Hanged! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to</span><br/>
<span id='49'>a fair end.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit, guarded</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Shall I endure this monstrous villany?</span><br/>
<span id='52'>I know from whence this same device proceeds:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>May this be borne?&mdash;as if his traitorous sons,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>That died by law for murder of our brother,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully!</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Go, drag the villain hither by the hair;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter AEMILIUS</em></p>
<span id='61'>What news with thee, AEmilius?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>AEMILIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Arm, arm, my lord;&mdash;Rome never had more cause.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>The Goths have gather'd head; and with a power</span><br/>
<span id='64'>High-resolved men, bent to the spoil,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>They hither march amain, under conduct</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do</span><br/>
<span id='68'>As much as ever Coriolanus did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?</span><br/>
<span id='70'>These tidings nip me, and I hang the head</span><br/>
<span id='71'>As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>'Tis he the common people love so much;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Myself hath often over-heard them say,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>When I have walked like a private man,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Why should you fear? is not your city strong?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And will revolt from me to succor him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?</span><br/>
<span id='83'>The eagle suffers little birds to sing,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And is not careful what they mean thereby,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Knowing that with the shadow of his wings</span><br/>
<span id='86'>He can at pleasure stint their melody:</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Then cheer thy spirit: for know, thou emperor,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>I will enchant the old Andronicus</span><br/>
<span id='90'>With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>When as the one is wounded with the bait,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>The other rotted with delicious feed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>But he will not entreat his son for us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>If Tamora entreat him, then he will:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>For I can smooth and fill his aged ear</span><br/>
<span id='97'>With golden promises; that, were his heart</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.</span><br/>
<p><em>To AEmilius</em></p>
<span id='100'>Go thou before, be our ambassador:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Say that the emperor requests a parley</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>AEmilius, do this message honourably:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And if he stand on hostage for his safety,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>AEMILIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Your bidding shall I do effectually.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Now will I to that old Andronicus;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And temper him with all the art I have,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And bury all thy fear in my devices.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Then go successantly, and plead to him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

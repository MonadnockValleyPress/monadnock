<h1>Macbeth</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive</span><br/>
<span id='2'>no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen</span><br/>
<span id='4'>her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon</span><br/>
<span id='5'>her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again</span><br/>
<span id='7'>return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once</span><br/>
<span id='9'>the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of</span><br/>
<span id='10'>watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her</span><br/>
<span id='11'>walking and other actual performances, what, at any</span><br/>
<span id='12'>time, have you heard her say?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>That, sir, which I will not report after her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to</span><br/>
<span id='16'>confirm my speech.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper</em></p>
<span id='17'>Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>How came she by that light?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Why, it stood by her: she has light by her</span><br/>
<span id='21'>continually; 'tis her command.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>You see, her eyes are open.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Ay, but their sense is shut.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus</span><br/>
<span id='26'>washing her hands: I have known her continue in</span><br/>
<span id='27'>this a quarter of an hour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Yet here's a spot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from</span><br/>
<span id='30'>her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Out, damned spot! out, I say!&mdash;One: two: why,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>then, 'tis time to do't.&mdash;Hell is murky!&mdash;Fie, my</span><br/>
<span id='33'>lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we</span><br/>
<span id='34'>fear who knows it, when none can call our power to</span><br/>
<span id='35'>account?&mdash;Yet who would have thought the old man</span><br/>
<span id='36'>to have had so much blood in him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Do you mark that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>What, will these hands ne'er be clean?&mdash;No more o'</span><br/>
<span id='40'>that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with</span><br/>
<span id='41'>this starting.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of</span><br/>
<span id='44'>that: heaven knows what she has known.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Here's the smell of the blood still: all the</span><br/>
<span id='46'>perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little</span><br/>
<span id='47'>hand. Oh, oh, oh!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the</span><br/>
<span id='50'>dignity of the whole body.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Well, well, well,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Pray God it be, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known</span><br/>
<span id='54'>those which have walked in their sleep who have died</span><br/>
<span id='55'>holily in their beds.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so</span><br/>
<span id='57'>pale.&mdash;I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he</span><br/>
<span id='58'>cannot come out on's grave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Even so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's</span><br/>
<span id='62'>done cannot be undone.&mdash;To bed, to bed, to bed!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Will she go now to bed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Directly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds</span><br/>
<span id='67'>To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>More needs she the divine than the physician.</span><br/>
<span id='69'>God, God forgive us all! Look after her;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Remove from her the means of all annoyance,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>I think, but dare not speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Good night, good doctor.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Taming of the Shrew</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Induction, Scene II</h3>
<h4>A bedchamber in the Lord's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter aloft SLY, with Attendants; some with apparel, others with basin and ewer and appurtenances; and Lord</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>For God's sake, a pot of small ale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Third Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>What raiment will your honour wear to-day?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor</span><br/>
<span id='6'>'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if</span><br/>
<span id='7'>you give me any conserves, give me conserves of</span><br/>
<span id='8'>beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I</span><br/>
<span id='9'>have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings</span><br/>
<span id='10'>than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my</span><br/>
<span id='12'>toes look through the over-leather.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!</span><br/>
<span id='14'>O, that a mighty man of such descent,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Of such possessions and so high esteem,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Should be infused with so foul a spirit!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a</span><br/>
<span id='19'>pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a</span><br/>
<span id='20'>bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if</span><br/>
<span id='22'>she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence</span><br/>
<span id='23'>on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the</span><br/>
<span id='24'>lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not</span><br/>
<span id='25'>bestraught: here's&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Third Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Second Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>O, this is it that makes your servants droop!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Look how thy servants do attend on thee,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Each in his office ready at thy beck.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,</span><br/>
<p><em>Music</em></p>
<span id='36'>And twenty caged nightingales do sing:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed</span><br/>
<span id='39'>On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>First Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift</span><br/>
<span id='48'>As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Second Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Adonis painted by a running brook,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And Cytherea all in sedges hid,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Even as the waving sedges play with wind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And how she was beguiled and surprised,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>As lively painted as the deed was done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Third Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Thou hast a lady far more beautiful</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Than any woman in this waning age.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>First Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>And till the tears that she hath shed for thee</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>She was the fairest creature in the world;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And yet she is inferior to none.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?</span><br/>
<span id='70'>I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Upon my life, I am a lord indeed</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Second Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?</span><br/>
<span id='77'>O, how we joy to see your wit restored!</span><br/>
<span id='78'>O, that once more you knew but what you are!</span><br/>
<span id='79'>These fifteen years you have been in a dream;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>But did I never speak of all that time?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>First Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And rail upon the hostess of the house;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And say you would present her at the leet,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Ay, the woman's maid of the house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Third Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And twenty more such names and men as these</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Which never were nor no man ever saw.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Amen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.</span><br/>

<span id='100'>How fares my noble lord?</span><br/>

<span id='101'>Marry, I fare well for here is cheer enough.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Where is my wife?</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Are you my wife and will not call me husband?</span><br/>
<span id='105'>My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Page</strong></span>

<span id='106'>My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>I am your wife in all obedience.</span><br/>

<span id='speech41'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>I know it well. What must I call her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords</span><br/>
<span id='112'>call ladies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And slept above some fifteen year or more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Page</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Madam, undress you and come now to bed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>Page</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you</span><br/>
<span id='120'>To pardon me yet for a night or two,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Or, if not so, until the sun be set:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>For your physicians have expressly charged,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>In peril to incur your former malady,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>That I should yet absent me from your bed:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>I hope this reason stands for my excuse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Ay, it stands so that I may hardly</span><br/>
<span id='127'>tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into</span><br/>
<span id='128'>my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in</span><br/>
<span id='129'>despite of the flesh and the blood.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Your honour's players, hearing your amendment,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Are come to play a pleasant comedy;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>For so your doctors hold it very meet,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Therefore they thought it good you hear a play</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a</span><br/>
<span id='139'>comedy, a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Page</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Page</strong></span>

<span id='142'>It is a kind of history.</span><br/>

<span id='143'>Well, we'll see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side</span><br/>

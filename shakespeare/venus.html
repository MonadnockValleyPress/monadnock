<h1>Venus and Adonis</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
  Vilia miretur vulgus; mihi flavus Apollo<br/>
  Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua.<br/>
  <br/>
  &mdash;Ovid
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>To the Right Honourable Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, and Baron of Titchfield.</p>
<p>Right Honourable, I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my unpolished lines to your lordship, nor how the world will censure me for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a burthen: only, if your honour seem but pleased, I account myself highly praised, and vow to take advantage of all idle hours, till I have honoured you with some graver labour. But if the first heir of my invention prove deformed, I shall be sorry it had so noble a godfather, and never after ear so barren a land, for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest. I leave it to your honourable survey, and your honour to your heart's content; which I wish may always answer your own wish and the world's hopeful expectation.</p>
<p>Your honour's in all duty,</p>
<p>William Shakespeare</p>
<hr/>
<p>
Even as the sun with purple-colour'd face<br/>
Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn,<br/>
Rose-cheek'd Adonis hied him to the chase;<br/>
Hunting he lov'd, but love he laugh'd to scorn;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And like a bold-fac'd suitor 'gins to woo him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thrice fairer than myself," thus she began,<br/>
"The field's chief flower, sweet above compare,<br/>
Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,<br/>
More white and red than doves or roses are:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,<br/>
And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;<br/>
If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed<br/>
A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And being set, I'll smother thee with kisses.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"And yet not cloy thy lips with loath'd satiety,<br/>
But rather famish them amid their plenty,<br/>
Making them red, and pale, with fresh variety:<br/>
Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A summer's day will seem an hour but short,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport."<br/>
</p>
<p>
With this she seizeth on his sweating palm,<br/>
The precedent of pith and livelihood,<br/>
And trembling in her passion, calls it balm,<br/>
Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being so enrag'd, desire doth lend her force<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Courageously to pluck him from his horse.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Over one arm the lusty courser's rein,<br/>
Under her other was the tender boy,<br/>
Who blush'd and pouted in a dull disdain,<br/>
With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She red and hot as coals of glowing fire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He red for shame, but frosty in desire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The studded bridle on a ragged bough<br/>
Nimbly she fastens;&mdash;O! how quick is love!&mdash;<br/>
The steed is stalled up, and even now<br/>
To tie the rider she begins to prove:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Backward she push'd him, as she would be thrust,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And govern'd him in strength, though not in lust.<br/>
</p>
<p>
So soon was she along, as he was down,<br/>
Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:<br/>
Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,<br/>
And 'gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open."<br/>
</p>
<p>
He burns with bashful shame, she with her tears<br/>
Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks;<br/>
Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs<br/>
To fan and blow them dry again she seeks.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He saith she is immodest, blames her miss;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What follows more, she murders with a kiss.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,<br/>
Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone,<br/>
Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,<br/>
Till either gorge be stuff'd or prey be gone:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so she kiss'd his brow, his cheek, his chin,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And where she ends she doth anew begin.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Forc'd to content, but never to obey,<br/>
Panting he lies, and breatheth in her face.<br/>
She feedeth on the steam, as on a prey,<br/>
And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So they were dew'd with such distilling showers.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Look how a bird lies tangled in a net,<br/>
So fasten'd in her arms Adonis lies;<br/>
Pure shame and aw'd resistance made him fret,<br/>
Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rain added to a river that is rank<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perforce will force it overflow the bank.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,<br/>
For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale.<br/>
Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets,<br/>
'Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy pale;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being red she loves him best, and being white,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her best is better'd with a more delight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;<br/>
And by her fair immortal hand she swears,<br/>
From his soft bosom never to remove,<br/>
Till he take truce with her contending tears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which long have rain'd, making her cheeks all wet;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Upon this promise did he raise his chin,<br/>
Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,<br/>
Who, being look'd on, ducks as quickly in;<br/>
So offers he to give what she did crave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But when her lips were ready for his pay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He winks, and turns his lips another way.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Never did passenger in summer's heat<br/>
More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.<br/>
Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;<br/>
She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"O! pity," 'gan she cry, "flint-hearted boy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis but a kiss I beg; why art thou coy?<br/>
</p>
<p>
"I have been woo'd as I entreat thee now,<br/>
Even by the stern and direful god of war,<br/>
Whose sinewy neck in battle ne'er did bow,<br/>
Who conquers where he comes in every jar;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And begg'd for that which thou unask'd shalt have.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Over my altars hath he hung his lance,<br/>
His batter'd shield, his uncontrolled crest,<br/>
And for my sake hath learn'd to sport and dance,<br/>
To toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thus he that overrul'd I oversway'd,<br/>
Leading him prisoner in a red rose chain:<br/>
Strong-temper'd steel his stronger strength obey'd,<br/>
Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For mast'ring her that foil'd the god of fight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine,<br/>
Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red,<br/>
The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine:<br/>
What see'st thou in the ground? hold up thy head,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look in mine eyeballs, there thy beauty lies;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Art thou asham'd to kiss? then wink again,<br/>
And I will wink; so shall the day seem night.<br/>
Love keeps his revels where there are but twain;<br/>
Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These blue-vein'd violets whereon we lean<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"The tender spring upon thy tempting lip<br/>
Shows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted,<br/>
Make use of time, let not advantage slip;<br/>
Beauty within itself should not be wasted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair flowers that are not gather'd in their prime<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rot, and consume themselves in little time.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Were I hard-favour'd, foul, or wrinkled old,<br/>
Ill-nurtur'd, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,<br/>
O'erworn, despised, rheumatic, and cold,<br/>
Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But having no defects, why dost abhor me?<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow,<br/>
Mine eyes are grey and bright, and quick in turning;<br/>
My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow,<br/>
My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,<br/>
Or like a fairy, trip upon the green,<br/>
Or like a nymph, with long dishevell'd hair,<br/>
Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love is a spirit all compact of fire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie:<br/>
These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;<br/>
Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,<br/>
From morn till night, even where I list to sport me.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee?<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Is thine own heart to thine own face affected?<br/>
Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?<br/>
Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected,<br/>
Steal thine own freedom, and complain on theft.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Narcissus so himself himself forsook,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,<br/>
Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,<br/>
Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear;<br/>
Things growing to themselves are growth's abuse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty breedeth beauty;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed,<br/>
Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?<br/>
By law of nature thou art bound to breed,<br/>
That thine may live when thou thyself art dead;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so in spite of death thou dost survive,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In that thy likeness still is left alive."<br/>
</p>
<p>
By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,<br/>
For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,<br/>
And Titan, tired in the midday heat,<br/>
With burning eye did hotly overlook them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So he were like him and by Venus' side.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now Adonis with a lazy spright,<br/>
And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,<br/>
His louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight,<br/>
Like misty vapours when they blot the sky,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Souring his cheeks, cries, "Fie, no more of love:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun doth burn my face; I must remove."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Ay me," quoth Venus, "young, and so unkind!<br/>
What bare excuses mak'st thou to be gone!<br/>
I'll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind<br/>
Shall cool the heat of this descending sun:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If they burn too, I'll quench them with my tears.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,<br/>
And lo I lie between that sun and thee:<br/>
The heat I have from thence doth little harm,<br/>
Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And were I not immortal, life were done,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between this heavenly and earthly sun.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel?<br/>
Nay more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth:<br/>
Art thou a woman's son and canst not feel<br/>
What 'tis to love, how want of love tormenteth?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O had thy mother borne so hard a mind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this?<br/>
Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?<br/>
What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?<br/>
Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me one kiss, I'll give it thee again,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And one for int'rest, if thou wilt have twain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Fie, lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,<br/>
Well-painted idol, image dull and dead,<br/>
Statue contenting but the eye alone,<br/>
Thing like a man, but of no woman bred:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art no man, though of a man's complexion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For men will kiss even by their own direction."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,<br/>
And swelling passion doth provoke a pause;<br/>
Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong;<br/>
Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now her sobs do her intendments break.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Sometimes she shakes her head, and then his hand,<br/>
Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;<br/>
Sometimes her arms infold him like a band:<br/>
She would, he will not in her arms be bound;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And when from thence he struggles to be gone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She locks her lily fingers one in one.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Fondling," she saith, "since I have hemm'd thee here<br/>
Within the circuit of this ivory pale,<br/>
I'll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;<br/>
Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Graze on my lips, and if those hills be dry,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Within this limit is relief enough,<br/>
Sweet bottom grass and high delightful plain,<br/>
Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,<br/>
To shelter thee from tempest and from rain:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then be my deer, since I am such a park,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark."<br/>
</p>
<p>
At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,<br/>
That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple;<br/>
Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,<br/>
He might be buried in a tomb so simple;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why there love liv'd, and there he could not die.<br/>
</p>
<p>
These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,<br/>
Open'd their mouths to swallow Venus' liking.<br/>
Being mad before, how doth she now for wits?<br/>
Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?<br/>
Her words are done, her woes the more increasing;<br/>
The time is spent, her object will away,<br/>
And from her twining arms doth urge releasing:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pity," she cries; "some favour, some remorse!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Away he springs, and hasteth to his horse.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But lo from forth a copse that neighbours by,<br/>
A breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud,<br/>
Adonis' tramping courser doth espy,<br/>
And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong-neck'd steed, being tied unto a tree,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,<br/>
And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;<br/>
The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,<br/>
Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron bit he crusheth 'tween his teeth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Controlling what he was controlled with.<br/>
</p>
<p>
His ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging mane<br/>
Upon his compass'd crest now stand on end;<br/>
His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,<br/>
As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shows his hot courage and his high desire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,<br/>
With gentle majesty and modest pride;<br/>
Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,<br/>
As who should say, "Lo thus my strength is tried;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And this I do to captivate the eye<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the fair breeder that is standing by."<br/>
</p>
<p>
What recketh he his rider's angry stir,<br/>
His flattering "Holla", or his "Stand, I say"?<br/>
What cares he now for curb or pricking spur?<br/>
For rich caparisons or trappings gay?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For nothing else with his proud sight agrees.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Look when a painter would surpass the life,<br/>
In limning out a well-proportion'd steed,<br/>
His art with nature's workmanship at strife,<br/>
As if the dead the living should exceed:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So did this horse excel a common one,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,<br/>
Broad breast, full eye, small head, and nostril wide,<br/>
High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,<br/>
Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save a proud rider on so proud a back.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Sometimes he scuds far off, and there he stares;<br/>
Anon he starts at stirring of a feather:<br/>
To bid the wind a base he now prepares,<br/>
And where he run or fly they know not whether;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He looks upon his love, and neighs unto her;<br/>
She answers him as if she knew his mind,<br/>
Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,<br/>
She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beating his kind embracements with her heels.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then like a melancholy malcontent,<br/>
He vails his tail that like a falling plume,<br/>
Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:<br/>
He stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His love, perceiving how he was enrag'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew kinder, and his fury was assuag'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
His testy master goeth about to take him,<br/>
When lo the unback'd breeder, full of fear,<br/>
Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,<br/>
With her the horse, and left Adonis there:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them.<br/>
</p>
<p>
All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits,<br/>
Banning his boisterous and unruly beast;<br/>
And now the happy season once more fits<br/>
That love-sick love by pleading may be blest;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is barr'd the aidance of the tongue.<br/>
</p>
<p>
An oven that is stopp'd, or river stay'd,<br/>
Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage:<br/>
So of concealed sorrow may be said,<br/>
Free vent of words love's fire doth assuage;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the heart's attorney once is mute,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He sees her coming, and begins to glow,<br/>
Even as a dying coal revives with wind,<br/>
And with his bonnet hides his angry brow,<br/>
Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking no notice that she is so nigh,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For all askance he holds her in his eye.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O what a sight it was, wistly to view<br/>
How she came stealing to the wayward boy,<br/>
To note the fighting conflict of her hue,<br/>
How white and red each other did destroy:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But now her cheek was pale, and by and by<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It flash'd forth fire, as lightning from the sky.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now was she just before him as he sat,<br/>
And like a lowly lover down she kneels;<br/>
With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,<br/>
Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His tend'rer cheek receives her soft hand's print,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As apt as new-fall'n snow takes any dint.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Oh what a war of looks was then between them,<br/>
Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing,<br/>
His eyes saw her eyes, as they had not seen them,<br/>
Her eyes woo'd still, his eyes disdain'd the wooing:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all this dumb play had his acts made plain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With tears, which, chorus-like, her eyes did rain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Full gently now she takes him by the hand,<br/>
A lily prison'd in a gaol of snow,<br/>
Or ivory in an alabaster band,<br/>
So white a friend engirts so white a foe:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Show'd like two silver doves that sit a-billing.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Once more the engine of her thoughts began:<br/>
"O fairest mover on this mortal round,<br/>
Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,<br/>
My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though nothing but my body's bane would cure thee."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Give me my hand," saith he, "why dost thou feel it?"<br/>
"Give me my heart," saith she, "and thou shalt have it.<br/>
O give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it,<br/>
And being steel'd, soft sighs can never grave it.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then love's deep groans I never shall regard,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Adonis' heart hath made mine hard."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"For shame," he cries, "let go, and let me go,<br/>
My day's delight is past, my horse is gone,<br/>
And 'tis your fault I am bereft him so,<br/>
I pray you hence, and leave me here alone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is how to get my palfrey from the mare."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus she replies: "Thy palfrey as he should,<br/>
Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire,<br/>
Affection is a coal that must be cool'd;<br/>
Else, suffer'd, it will set the heart on fire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"How like a jade he stood tied to the tree,<br/>
Servilely master'd with a leathern rein!<br/>
But when he saw his love, his youth's fair fee,<br/>
He held such petty bondage in disdain;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,<br/>
Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,<br/>
But when his glutton eye so full hath fed,<br/>
His other agents aim at like delight?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is so faint that dare not be so bold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To touch the fire, the weather being cold?<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy,<br/>
And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee,<br/>
To take advantage on presented joy,<br/>
Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O learn to love, the lesson is but plain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And once made perfect, never lost again."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"I know not love," quoth he, "nor will not know it,<br/>
Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it;<br/>
'Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it;<br/>
My love to love is love but to disgrace it;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For I have heard, it is a life in death,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish'd?<br/>
Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?<br/>
If springing things be any jot diminish'd,<br/>
They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The colt that's back'd and burden'd being young,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Loseth his pride, and never waxeth strong.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"You hurt my hand with wringing. Let us part,<br/>
And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat:<br/>
Remove your siege from my unyielding heart,<br/>
To love's alarms it will not ope the gate:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flatt'ry;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For where a heart is hard they make no batt'ry."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What! canst thou talk?" quoth she, "hast thou a tongue?<br/>
O would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing;<br/>
Thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong;<br/>
I had my load before, now press'd with bearing:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Melodious discord, heavenly tune, harsh-sounding,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ear's deep sweet music, and heart's deep sore wounding.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love<br/>
That inward beauty and invisible;<br/>
Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move<br/>
Each part in me that were but sensible:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet should I be in love by touching thee.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Say that the sense of feeling were bereft me,<br/>
And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch,<br/>
And nothing but the very smell were left me,<br/>
Yet would my love to thee be still as much;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For from the stillitory of thy face excelling<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes breath perfum'd, that breedeth love by smelling.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"But oh what banquet wert thou to the taste,<br/>
Being nurse and feeder of the other four;<br/>
Would they not wish the feast might ever last,<br/>
And bid suspicion double-lock the door,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should by his stealing in disturb the feast?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
Once more the ruby-colour'd portal open'd,<br/>
Which to his speech did honey passage yield,<br/>
Like a red morn that ever yet betoken'd<br/>
Wrack to the seaman, tempest to the field,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This ill presage advisedly she marketh:<br/>
Even as the wind is hush'd before it raineth,<br/>
Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh,<br/>
Or as the berry breaks before it staineth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His meaning struck her ere his words begun.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And at his look she flatly falleth down<br/>
For looks kill love, and love by looks reviveth;<br/>
A smile recures the wounding of a frown;<br/>
But blessed bankrout, that by love so thriveth!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The silly boy, believing she is dead,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And all amaz'd brake off his late intent,<br/>
For sharply he did think to reprehend her,<br/>
Which cunning love did wittily prevent:<br/>
Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For on the grass she lies as she were slain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till his breath breatheth life in her again.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,<br/>
He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,<br/>
He chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks<br/>
To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr'd:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He kisses her; and she, by her good will,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will never rise, so he will kiss her still.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The night of sorrow now is turn'd to day:<br/>
Her two blue windows faintly she up-heaveth,<br/>
Like the fair sun when in his fresh array<br/>
He cheers the morn, and all the world relieveth:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So is her face illumin'd with her eye.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix'd,<br/>
As if from thence they borrow'd all their shine.<br/>
Were never four such lamps together mix'd,<br/>
Had not his clouded with his brow's repine;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone like the moon in water seen by night.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O where am I?" quoth she, "in earth or heaven?<br/>
Or in the ocean drench'd, or in the fire?<br/>
What hour is this? or morn or weary even?<br/>
Do I delight to die, or life desire?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But now I liv'd, and life was death's annoy;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But now I died, and death was lively joy.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O thou didst kill me; kill me once again:<br/>
Thy eyes' shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine,<br/>
Hath taught them scornful tricks, and such disdain,<br/>
That they have murder'd this poor heart of mine;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Long may they kiss each other for this cure!<br/>
Oh never let their crimson liveries wear,<br/>
And as they last, their verdure still endure,<br/>
To drive infection from the dangerous year:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That the star-gazers, having writ on death,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,<br/>
What bargains may I make, still to be sealing?<br/>
To sell myself I can be well contented,<br/>
So thou wilt buy, and pay, and use good dealing;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Set thy seal manual on my wax-red lips.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"A thousand kisses buys my heart from me;<br/>
And pay them at thy leisure, one by one,<br/>
What is ten hundred touches unto thee?<br/>
Are they not quickly told and quickly gone?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, for non-payment that the debt should double,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?"<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Fair queen," quoth he, "if any love you owe me,<br/>
Measure my strangeness with my unripe years:<br/>
Before I know myself, seek not to know me;<br/>
No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or being early pluck'd, is sour to taste.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Look the world's comforter, with weary gait<br/>
His day's hot task hath ended in the west;<br/>
The owl, night's herald, shrieks, 'tis very late;<br/>
The sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven's light<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do summon us to part, and bid good night.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Now let me say good night, and so say you;<br/>
If you will say so, you shall have a kiss."<br/>
"Good night," quoth she; and ere he says adieu,<br/>
The honey fee of parting tender'd is:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Incorporate then they seem, face grows to face.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Till breathless he disjoin'd, and backward drew<br/>
The heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth,<br/>
Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew,<br/>
Whereon they surfeit, yet complain on drouth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He with her plenty press'd, she faint with dearth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their lips together glued, fall to the earth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,<br/>
And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth;<br/>
Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey,<br/>
Paying what ransom the insulter willeth;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That she will draw his lips' rich treasure dry.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And having felt the sweetness of the spoil,<br/>
With blindfold fury she begins to forage;<br/>
Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,<br/>
And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Planting oblivion, beating reason back,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgetting shame's pure blush and honour's wrack.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Hot, faint, and weary, with her hard embracing,<br/>
Like a wild bird being tam'd with too much handling,<br/>
Or as the fleet-foot roe that's tir'd with chasing,<br/>
Or like the froward infant still'd with dandling:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He now obeys, and now no more resisteth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While she takes all she can, not all she listeth.<br/>
</p>
<p>
What wax so frozen but dissolves with temp'ring,<br/>
And yields at last to every light impression?<br/>
Things out of hope are compass'd oft with vent'ring,<br/>
Chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Affection faints not like a pale-fac'd coward,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But then woos best when most his choice is froward.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When he did frown, O had she then gave over,<br/>
Such nectar from his lips she had not suck'd.<br/>
Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover;<br/>
What though the rose have prickles, yet 'tis pluck'd.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet love breaks through, and picks them all at last.<br/>
</p>
<p>
For pity now she can no more detain him;<br/>
The poor fool prays her that he may depart:<br/>
She is resolv'd no longer to restrain him,<br/>
Bids him farewell, and look well to her heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The which by Cupid's bow she doth protest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He carries thence encaged in his breast.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Sweet boy," she says, "this night I'll waste in sorrow,<br/>
For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch.<br/>
Tell me, love's master, shall we meet tomorrow<br/>
Say, shall we? shall we? wilt thou make the match?"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He tells her no, tomorrow he intends<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To hunt the boar with certain of his friends.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"The boar!" quoth she; whereat a sudden pale,<br/>
Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose,<br/>
Usurps her cheek, she trembles at his tale,<br/>
And on his neck her yoking arms she throws.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He on her belly falls, she on her back.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now is she in the very lists of love,<br/>
Her champion mounted for the hot encounter:<br/>
All is imaginary she doth prove,<br/>
He will not manage her, although he mount her;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That worse than Tantalus' is her annoy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To clip Elysium and to lack her joy.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Even as poor birds, deceiv'd with painted grapes,<br/>
Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw:<br/>
Even so she languisheth in her mishaps,<br/>
As those poor birds that helpless berries saw.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm effects which she in him finds missing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She seeks to kindle with continual kissing.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But all in vain, good queen, it will not be,<br/>
She hath assay'd as much as may be prov'd;<br/>
Her pleading hath deserv'd a greater fee;<br/>
She's love, she loves, and yet she is not lov'd.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fie, fie," he says, "you crush me; let me go;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You have no reason to withhold me so."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Thou hadst been gone," quoth she, "sweet boy, ere this,<br/>
But that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar.<br/>
Oh be advis'd; thou know'st not what it is,<br/>
With javelin's point a churlish swine to gore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose tushes never sheath'd he whetteth still,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like to a mortal butcher, bent to kill.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"On his bow-back he hath a battle set<br/>
Of bristly pikes, that ever threat his foes;<br/>
His eyes like glow-worms shine when he doth fret;<br/>
His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being mov'd, he strikes whate'er is in his way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"His brawny sides, with hairy bristles armed,<br/>
Are better proof than thy spear's point can enter;<br/>
His short thick neck cannot be easily harmed;<br/>
Being ireful, on the lion he will venture:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The thorny brambles and embracing bushes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Alas! he naught esteems that face of thine,<br/>
To which love's eyes pay tributary gazes;<br/>
Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips, and crystal eyne,<br/>
Whose full perfection all the world amazes;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But having thee at vantage, wondrous dread!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Oh let him keep his loathsome cabin still,<br/>
Beauty hath naught to do with such foul fiends:<br/>
Come not within his danger by thy will;<br/>
They that thrive well, take counsel of their friends.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear'd thy fortune, and my joints did tremble.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Didst thou not mark my face, was it not white?<br/>
Saw'st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye?<br/>
Grew I not faint, and fell I not downright?<br/>
Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"For where love reigns, disturbing jealousy<br/>
Doth call himself affection's sentinel;<br/>
Gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny,<br/>
And in a peaceful hour doth cry "Kill, kill!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Distemp'ring gentle love in his desire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As air and water do abate the fire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,<br/>
This canker that eats up love's tender spring,<br/>
This carry-tale, dissentious jealousy,<br/>
That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocks at my heart, and whispers in mine ear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That if I love thee, I thy death should fear.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"And more than so, presenteth to mine eye<br/>
The picture of an angry chafing boar,<br/>
Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie<br/>
An image like thyself, all stain'd with gore;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What should I do, seeing thee so indeed,<br/>
That tremble at th'imagination?<br/>
The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed,<br/>
And fear doth teach it divination:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou encounter with the boar tomorrow.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"But if thou needs wilt hunt, be rul'd by me;<br/>
Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,<br/>
Or at the fox which lives by subtilty,<br/>
Or at the roe which no encounter dare:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And on thy well-breath'd horse keep with thy hounds.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,<br/>
Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles<br/>
How he outruns the wind, and with what care<br/>
He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The many musits through the which he goes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,<br/>
To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,<br/>
And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,<br/>
To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Danger deviseth shifts, wit waits on fear.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"For there his smell with others being mingled,<br/>
The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,<br/>
Ceasing their clamorous cry, till they have singled<br/>
With much ado the cold fault cleanly out;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then do they spend their mouths: echo replies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if another chase were in the skies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,<br/>
Stands on his hinder legs with list'ning ear,<br/>
To hearken if his foes pursue him still.<br/>
Anon their loud alarums he doth hear;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now his grief may be compared well<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To one sore sick that hears the passing bell.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch<br/>
Turn, and return, indenting with the way,<br/>
Each envious briar his weary legs do scratch,<br/>
Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For misery is trodden on by many,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And being low never reliev'd by any.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Lie quietly, and hear a little more;<br/>
Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:<br/>
To make thee hate the hunting of the boar,<br/>
Unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying this to that, and so to so,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For love can comment upon every woe.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Where did I leave?" "No matter where," quoth he<br/>
"Leave me, and then the story aptly ends:<br/>
The night is spent." "Why, what of that?" quoth she.<br/>
"I am," quoth he, "expected of my friends;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now 'tis dark, and going I shall fall."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"In night," quoth she, "desire sees best of all."<br/>
</p>
<p>
But if thou fall, oh then imagine this,<br/>
The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,<br/>
And all is but to rob thee of a kiss.<br/>
Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Now of this dark night I perceive the reason:<br/>
Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine<br/>
Till forging nature be condemn'd of treason,<br/>
For stealing moulds from heaven, that were divine;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein she fram'd thee, in high heaven's despite,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To shame the sun by day and her by night.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"And therefore hath she brib'd the destinies,<br/>
To cross the curious workmanship of nature,<br/>
To mingle beauty with infirmities,<br/>
And pure perfection with impure defeature,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Making it subject to the tyranny<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mad mischances and much misery.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"As burning fevers, agues pale and faint,<br/>
Life-poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood,<br/>
The marrow-eating sickness, whose attaint<br/>
Disorder breeds by heating of the blood;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Surfeits, imposthumes, grief, and damn'd despair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Swear nature's death, for framing thee so fair.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"And not the least of all these maladies<br/>
But in one minute's fight brings beauty under:<br/>
Both favour, savour, hue and qualities,<br/>
Whereat th'impartial gazer late did wonder,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are on the sudden wasted, thaw'd and done,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As mountain snow melts with the midday sun.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Therefore despite of fruitless chastity,<br/>
Love-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns,<br/>
That on the earth would breed a scarcity<br/>
And barren dearth of daughters and of sons,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be prodigal: the lamp that burns by night<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dries up his oil to lend the world his light.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What is thy body but a swallowing grave,<br/>
Seeming to bury that posterity,<br/>
Which by the rights of time thou needs must have,<br/>
If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, the world will hold thee in disdain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"So in thyself thyself art made away;<br/>
A mischief worse than civil home-bred strife,<br/>
Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay,<br/>
Or butcher sire that reeves his son of life.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Foul cank'ring rust the hidden treasure frets,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But gold that's put to use more gold begets."<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Nay then," quoth Adon, "you will fall again<br/>
Into your idle over-handled theme;<br/>
The kiss I gave you is bestow'd in vain,<br/>
And all in vain you strive against the stream;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For by this black-fac'd night, desire's foul nurse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,<br/>
And every tongue more moving than your own,<br/>
Bewitching like the wanton mermaid's songs,<br/>
Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For know, my heart stands armed in mine ear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And will not let a false sound enter there.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Lest the deceiving harmony should run<br/>
Into the quiet closure of my breast,<br/>
And then my little heart were quite undone,<br/>
In his bedchamber to be barr'd of rest.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"What have you urg'd that I cannot reprove?<br/>
The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger;<br/>
I hate not love, but your device in love<br/>
That lends embracements unto every stranger.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You do it for increase: O strange excuse!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When reason is the bawd to lust's abuse.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Call it not love, for love to heaven is fled,<br/>
Since sweating lust on earth usurp'd his name;<br/>
Under whose simple semblance he hath fed<br/>
Upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As caterpillars do the tender leaves.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,<br/>
But lust's effect is tempest after sun;<br/>
Love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain,<br/>
Lust's winter comes ere summer half be done.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love surfeits not, lust like a glutton dies;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love is all truth, lust full of forged lies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"More I could tell, but more I dare not say;<br/>
The text is old, the orator too green.<br/>
Therefore, in sadness, now I will away;<br/>
My face is full of shame, my heart of teen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine ears, that to your wanton talk attended<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do burn themselves for having so offended."<br/>
</p>
<p>
With this he breaketh from the sweet embrace<br/>
Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,<br/>
And homeward through the dark laund runs apace;<br/>
Leaves love upon her back deeply distress'd.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look how a bright star shooteth from the sky,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So glides he in the night from Venus' eye.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Which after him she darts, as one on shore<br/>
Gazing upon a late embarked friend,<br/>
Till the wild waves will have him seen no more,<br/>
Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So did the merciless and pitchy night<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fold in the object that did feed her sight.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Whereat amaz'd, as one that unaware<br/>
Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,<br/>
Or 'stonish'd as night-wanderers often are,<br/>
Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so confounded in the dark she lay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Having lost the fair discovery of her way.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,<br/>
That all the neighbour caves, as seeming troubled,<br/>
Make verbal repetition of her moans;<br/>
Passion on passion deeply is redoubled:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ay me!" she cries, and twenty times, "Woe, woe!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.<br/>
</p>
<p>
She marking them, begins a wailing note,<br/>
And sings extemporally a woeful ditty;<br/>
How love makes young men thrall, and old men dote,<br/>
How love is wise in folly foolish witty:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And still the choir of echoes answer so.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Her song was tedious, and outwore the night,<br/>
For lovers' hours are long, though seeming short,<br/>
If pleas'd themselves, others they think, delight<br/>
In such like circumstance, with such like sport:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their copious stories oftentimes begun,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;End without audience, and are never done.<br/>
</p>
<p>
For who hath she to spend the night withal,<br/>
But idle sounds resembling parasites;<br/>
Like shrill-tongu'd tapsters answering every call,<br/>
Soothing the humour of fantastic wits?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She says, "'Tis so:" they answer all, "'Tis so;"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And would say after her, if she said "No."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Lo here the gentle lark, weary of rest,<br/>
From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,<br/>
And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast<br/>
The sun ariseth in his majesty;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who doth the world so gloriously behold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That cedar tops and hills seem burnish'd gold.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Venus salutes him with this fair good morrow:<br/>
"Oh thou clear god, and patron of all light,<br/>
From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow<br/>
The beauteous influence that makes him bright,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There lives a son that suck'd an earthly mother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other."<br/>
</p>
<p>
This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,<br/>
Musing the morning is so much o'erworn,<br/>
And yet she hears no tidings of her love;<br/>
She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon she hears them chant it lustily,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And as she runs, the bushes in the way<br/>
Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,<br/>
Some twine about her thigh to make her stay:<br/>
She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.<br/>
</p>
<p>
By this she hears the hounds are at a bay,<br/>
Whereat she starts like one that spies an adder<br/>
Wreath'd up in fatal folds just in his way,<br/>
The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Appals her senses, and her spirit confounds.<br/>
</p>
<p>
For now she knows it is no gentle chase,<br/>
But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,<br/>
Because the cry remaineth in one place,<br/>
Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding their enemy to be so curst,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They all strain court'sy who shall cope him first. 888<br/>
</p>
<p>
This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,<br/>
Through which it enters to surprise her heart;<br/>
Who overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,<br/>
With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like soldiers when their captain once doth yield,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They basely fly and dare not stay the field.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy,<br/>
Till cheering up her senses sore dismay'd,<br/>
She tells them 'tis a causeless fantasy,<br/>
And childish error, that they are afraid;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that word, she spied the hunted boar.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red,<br/>
Like milk and blood being mingled both together,<br/>
A second fear through all her sinews spread,<br/>
Which madly hurries her she knows not whither:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This way she runs, and now she will no further,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But back retires, to rate the boar for murther.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways,<br/>
She treads the path that she untreads again;<br/>
Her more than haste is mated with delays,<br/>
Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of respects, yet naught at all respecting,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In hand with all things, naught at all effecting.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Here kennel'd in a brake she finds a hound,<br/>
And asks the weary caitiff for his master,<br/>
And there another licking of his wound,<br/>
'Gainst venom'd sores the only sovereign plaster.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And here she meets another sadly scowling,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When he hath ceas'd his ill-resounding noise,<br/>
Another flap-mouth'd mourner, black and grim,<br/>
Against the welkin volleys out his voice;<br/>
Another and another answer him,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clapping their proud tails to the ground below,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaking their scratch'd ears, bleeding as they go.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Look how the world's poor people are amazed<br/>
At apparitions, signs, and prodigies,<br/>
Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,<br/>
Infusing them with dreadful prophecies;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So she at these sad signs draws up her breath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sighing it again, exclaims on death.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hard-favour'd tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,<br/>
Hateful divorce of love," thus chides she death,<br/>
"Grim-grinning ghost, earth's worm, what dost thou mean?<br/>
To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who when he liv'd, his breath and beauty set<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"If he be dead, O no, it cannot be,<br/>
Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it,<br/>
O yes, it may, thou hast no eyes to see,<br/>
But hatefully at random dost thou hit.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mistakes that aim, and cleaves an infant's heart.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke,<br/>
And hearing him, thy power had lost his power.<br/>
The destinies will curse thee for this stroke;<br/>
They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck'st a flower.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love's golden arrow at him should have fled,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And not death's ebon dart to strike him dead.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Dost thou drink tears, that thou provok'st such weeping?<br/>
What may a heavy groan advantage thee?<br/>
Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping<br/>
Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since her best work is ruin'd with thy rigour."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Here overcome, as one full of despair,<br/>
She vail'd her eyelids, who like sluices stopp'd<br/>
The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair<br/>
In the sweet channel of her bosom dropp'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And with his strong course opens them again.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow;<br/>
Her eyes seen in the tears, tears in her eye;<br/>
Both crystals, where they view'd each other's sorrow,<br/>
Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Variable passions throng her constant woe,<br/>
As striving who should best become her grief;<br/>
All entertain'd, each passion labours so,<br/>
That every present sorrow seemeth chief,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But none is best, then join they all together,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.<br/>
</p>
<p>
By this, far off she hears some huntsman holla;<br/>
A nurse's song ne'er pleas'd her babe so well:<br/>
The dire imagination she did follow<br/>
This sound of hope doth labour to expel;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And flatters her it is Adonis' voice.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Whereat her tears began to turn their tide,<br/>
Being prison'd in her eye, like pearls in glass;<br/>
Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,<br/>
Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown'd.<br/>
</p>
<p>
O hard-believing love, how strange it seems<br/>
Not to believe, and yet too credulous;<br/>
Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;<br/>
Despair and hope make thee ridiculous,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought,<br/>
Adonis lives, and death is not to blame;<br/>
It was not she that call'd him all to naught;<br/>
Now she adds honours to his hateful name.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She clepes him king of graves, and grave for kings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperious supreme of all mortal things.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"No, no," quoth she, "sweet death, I did but jest;<br/>
Yet pardon me, I felt a kind of fear<br/>
Whenas I met the boar, that bloody beast,<br/>
Which knows no pity, but is still severe;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, gentle shadow,&mdash;truth I must confess&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I rail'd on thee, fearing my love's decease.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"'Tis not my fault, the boar provok'd my tongue;<br/>
Be wreak'd on him, invisible commander;<br/>
'Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong;<br/>
I did but act, he's author of my slander.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could rule them both, without ten women's wit."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus hoping that Adonis is alive,<br/>
Her rash suspect she doth extenuate;<br/>
And that his beauty may the better thrive,<br/>
With death she humbly doth insinuate;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs and stories<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His victories, his triumphs and his glories.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"O love!" quoth she, "how much a fool was I,<br/>
To be of such a weak and silly mind,<br/>
To wail his death who lives, and must not die<br/>
Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And beauty dead, black Chaos comes again.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Fie, fie, fond love, thou art as full of fear<br/>
As one with treasure laden, hemm'd with thieves,<br/>
Trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear,<br/>
Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even at this word she hears a merry horn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As falcon to the lure, away she flies;<br/>
The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light,<br/>
And in her haste unfortunately spies<br/>
The foul boar's conquest on her fair delight;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which seen, her eyes, as murder'd with the view,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like stars asham'd of day, themselves withdrew.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Or as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,<br/>
Shrinks backwards in his shelly cave with pain,<br/>
And there all smother'd up, in shade doth sit,<br/>
Long after fearing to creep forth again:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So at his bloody view her eyes are fled<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the deep dark cabins of her head.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Where they resign their office and their light<br/>
To the disposing of her troubled brain,<br/>
Who bids them still consort with ugly night,<br/>
And never wound the heart with looks again;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who like a king perplexed in his throne,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By their suggestion gives a deadly groan.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Whereat each tributary subject quakes,<br/>
As when the wind imprison'd in the ground,<br/>
Struggling for passage, earth's foundation shakes,<br/>
Which with cold terror doth men's minds confound.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This mutiny each part doth so surprise<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And being open'd, threw unwilling light<br/>
Upon the wide wound that the boar had trench'd<br/>
In his soft flank, whose wonted lily white<br/>
With purple tears that his wound wept, was drench'd.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf or weed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But stole his blood and seem'd with him to bleed.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth,<br/>
Over one shoulder doth she hang her head,<br/>
Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth;<br/>
She thinks he could not die, he is not dead:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her voice is stopp'd, her joints forget to bow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eyes are mad, that they have wept till now.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly,<br/>
That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three;<br/>
And then she reprehends her mangling eye,<br/>
That makes more gashes, where no breach should be:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"My tongue cannot express my grief for one,<br/>
And yet," quoth she, "behold two Adons dead!<br/>
My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,<br/>
Mine eyes are turn'd to fire, my heart to lead:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy heart's lead, melt at mine eyes' red fire!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So shall I die by drops of hot desire.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Alas poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!<br/>
What face remains alive that's worth the viewing?<br/>
Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast<br/>
Of things long since, or anything ensuing?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But true sweet beauty liv'd and died with him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear!<br/>
Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you:<br/>
Having no fair to lose, you need not fear;<br/>
The sun doth scorn you, and the wind doth hiss you.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Adonis liv'd, sun and sharp air<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lurk'd like two thieves, to rob him of his fair.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"And therefore would he put his bonnet on,<br/>
Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;<br/>
The wind would blow it off, and being gone,<br/>
Play with his locks; then would Adonis weep;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And straight, in pity of his tender years,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They both would strive who first should dry his tears.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"To see his face the lion walk'd along<br/>
Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him;<br/>
To recreate himself when he hath sung,<br/>
The tiger would be tame and gently hear him.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And never fright the silly lamb that day.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"When he beheld his shadow in the brook,<br/>
The fishes spread on it their golden gills;<br/>
When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,<br/>
That some would sing, some other in their bills<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He fed them with his sight, they him with berries.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"But this foul, grim, and urchin-snouted boar,<br/>
Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave,<br/>
Ne'er saw the beauteous livery that he wore;<br/>
Witness the entertainment that he gave.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If he did see his face, why then I know<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought to kiss him, and hath kill'd him so.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"'Tis true, 'tis true; thus was Adonis slain:<br/>
He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,<br/>
Who did not whet his teeth at him again,<br/>
But by a kiss thought to persuade him there;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheath'd unaware the tusk in his soft groin.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Had I been tooth'd like him, I must confess,<br/>
With kissing him I should have kill'd him first;<br/>
But he is dead, and never did he bless<br/>
My youth with his; the more am I accurst."<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With this she falleth in the place she stood,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stains her face with his congealed blood.<br/>
</p>
<p>
She looks upon his lips, and they are pale;<br/>
She takes him by the hand, and that is cold,<br/>
She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,<br/>
As if they heard the woeful words she told;<br/>
She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,<br/>
Where lo, two lamps burnt out in darkness lies.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Two glasses where herself herself beheld<br/>
A thousand times, and now no more reflect;<br/>
Their virtue lost, wherein they late excell'd,<br/>
And every beauty robb'd of his effect.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wonder of time," quoth she, "this is my spite,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou being dead, the day should yet be light.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Since thou art dead, lo here I prophesy,<br/>
Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend:<br/>
It shall be waited on with jealousy,<br/>
Find sweet beginning, but unsavoury end;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne'er settled equally, but high or low,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That all love's pleasure shall not match his woe.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"It shall be fickle, false and full of fraud,<br/>
Bud, and be blasted in a breathing while;<br/>
The bottom poison, and the top o'erstraw'd<br/>
With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The strongest body shall it make most weak,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Strike the wise dumb, and teach the fool to speak.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"It shall be sparing, and too full of riot,<br/>
Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures;<br/>
The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,<br/>
Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be raging mad, and silly mild,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make the young old, the old become a child.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"It shall suspect where is no cause of fear,<br/>
It shall not fear where it should most mistrust;<br/>
It shall be merciful, and too severe,<br/>
And most deceiving when it seems most just;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perverse it shall be, where it shows most toward,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Put fear to valour, courage to the coward.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"It shall be cause of war and dire events,<br/>
And set dissension 'twixt the son and sire;<br/>
Subject and servile to all discontents,<br/>
As dry combustious matter is to fire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sith in his prime death doth my love destroy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They that love best their love shall not enjoy."<br/>
</p>
<p>
By this the boy that by her side lay kill'd<br/>
Was melted like a vapour from her sight,<br/>
And in his blood that on the ground lay spill'd,<br/>
A purple flower sprung up, chequer'd with white,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Resembling well his pale cheeks, and the blood<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.<br/>
</p>
<p>
She bows her head, the new-sprung flower to smell,<br/>
Comparing it to her Adonis' breath;<br/>
And says within her bosom it shall dwell,<br/>
Since he himself is reft from her by death;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Green-dropping sap, which she compares to tears.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Poor flower," quoth she, "this was thy father's guise,<br/>
Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire,<br/>
For every little grief to wet his eyes,<br/>
To grow unto himself was his desire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so 'tis thine; but know, it is as good<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To wither in my breast as in his blood.<br/>
</p>
<p>
"Here was thy father's bed, here in my breast;<br/>
Thou art the next of blood, and 'tis thy right:<br/>
Lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest,<br/>
My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall not be one minute in an hour<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love's flower."<br/>
</p>
<p>
Thus weary of the world, away she hies,<br/>
And yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid<br/>
Their mistress mounted through the empty skies,<br/>
In her light chariot quickly is convey'd;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Means to immure herself and not be seen.<br/>

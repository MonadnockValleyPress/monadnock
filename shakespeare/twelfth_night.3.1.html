<h4>Olivia's garden.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter VIOLA, and Clown with a tabour</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by</span><br/>
<span id='2'>thy tabour?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>No, sir, I live by the church.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Art thou a churchman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for</span><br/>
<span id='6'>I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by</span><br/>
<span id='7'>the church.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a</span><br/>
<span id='9'>beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy</span><br/>
<span id='10'>tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is</span><br/>
<span id='12'>but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the</span><br/>
<span id='13'>wrong side may be turned outward!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with</span><br/>
<span id='15'>words may quickly make them wanton.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Why, man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that</span><br/>
<span id='19'>word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words</span><br/>
<span id='20'>are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Thy reason, man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and</span><br/>
<span id='23'>words are grown so false, I am loath to prove</span><br/>
<span id='24'>reason with them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my</span><br/>
<span id='27'>conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be</span><br/>
<span id='28'>to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she</span><br/>
<span id='31'>will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and</span><br/>
<span id='32'>fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to</span><br/>
<span id='33'>herrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not</span><br/>
<span id='34'>her fool, but her corrupter of words.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but</span><br/>
<span id='38'>the fool should be as oft with your master as with</span><br/>
<span id='39'>my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Hold, there's expenses for thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for</span><br/>
<span id='44'>one; though I would not have it grow on my chin. 
<span id='45'>Is thy lady within?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Yes, being kept together and put to use.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring</span><br/>
<span id='49'>a Cressida to this Troilus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but</span><br/>
<span id='52'>a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is</span><br/>
<span id='53'>within, sir. I will construe to them whence you</span><br/>
<span id='54'>come; who you are and what you would are out of my</span><br/>
<span id='55'>welkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And to do that well craves a kind of wit:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>He must observe their mood on whom he jests,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>The quality of persons, and the time,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather</span><br/>
<span id='61'>That comes before his eye. This is a practise</span><br/>
<span id='62'>As full of labour as a wise man's art</span><br/>
<span id='63'>For folly that he wisely shows is fit;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Save you, gentleman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>And you, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Dieu vous garde, monsieur.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous</span><br/>
<span id='71'>you should enter, if your trade be to her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the</span><br/>
<span id='73'>list of my voyage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>My legs do better understand me, sir, than I</span><br/>
<span id='76'>understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>I mean, to go, sir, to enter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we</span><br/>
<span id='79'>are prevented.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter OLIVIA and MARIA</em></p>
<span id='80'>Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain</span><br/>
<span id='81'>odours on you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>That youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours;' well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>My matter hath no voice, to your own most pregnant</span><br/>
<span id='84'>and vouchsafed ear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'em</span><br/>
<span id='86'>all three all ready.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and MARIA</em></p>
<span id='88'>Give me your hand, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>My duty, madam, and most humble service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>What is your name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='100'>On his behalf.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>                  O, by your leave, I pray you,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>I bade you never speak again of him:</span><br/>
<span id='103'>But, would you undertake another suit,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>I had rather hear you to solicit that</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Than music from the spheres.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Dear lady,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>After the last enchantment you did here,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Under your hard construction must I sit,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Have you not set mine honour at the stake</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='116'>That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>I pity you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>          That's a degree to love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>That very oft we pity enemies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.</span><br/>
<span id='124'>O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!</span><br/>
<span id='125'>If one should be a prey, how much the better</span><br/>
<span id='126'>To fall before the lion than the wolf!</span><br/>
<p><em>Clock strikes</em></p>
<span id='127'>The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Your wife is like to reap a proper man:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>There lies your way, due west.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Attend your ladyship!</span><br/>
<span id='134'>You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Stay:</span><br/>
<span id='136'>I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>That you do think you are not what you are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>If I think so, I think the same of you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Then think you right: I am not what I am.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>I would you were as I would have you be!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Would it be better, madam, than I am?</span><br/>
<span id='142'>I wish it might, for now I am your fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful</span><br/>
<span id='144'>In the contempt and anger of his lip!</span><br/>
<span id='145'>A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Cesario, by the roses of the spring,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>But rather reason thus with reason fetter,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Love sought is good, but given unsought better.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>By innocence I swear, and by my youth</span><br/>
<span id='156'>I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>And that no woman has; nor never none</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And so adieu, good madam: never more</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Will I my master's tears to you deplore.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move</span><br/>
<span id='162'>That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

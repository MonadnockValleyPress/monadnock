<h1>The Merchant of Venice</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</H3>
<h4>Venice. A public place.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Three thousand ducats; well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Ay, sir, for three months.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>For three months; well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Antonio shall become bound; well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I</span><br/>
<span id='7'>know your answer?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Your answer to that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Antonio is a good man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a</span><br/>
<span id='13'>good man is to have you understand me that he is</span><br/>
<span id='14'>sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he</span><br/>
<span id='15'>hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he</span><br/>
<span id='17'>hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and</span><br/>
<span id='18'>other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships</span><br/>
<span id='19'>are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats</span><br/>
<span id='20'>and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I</span><br/>
<span id='21'>mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may</span><br/>
<span id='24'>take his bond.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Be assured you may.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>If it please you to dine with us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which</span><br/>
<span id='30'>your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I</span><br/>
<span id='31'>will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat</span><br/>
<span id='33'>with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What</span><br/>
<span id='34'>news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ANTONIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>This is Signior Antonio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>[Aside]  How like a fawning publican he looks!</span><br/>
<span id='37'>I hate him for he is a Christian,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>But more for that in low simplicity</span><br/>
<span id='39'>He lends out money gratis and brings down</span><br/>
<span id='40'>The rate of usance here with us in Venice.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>If I can catch him once upon the hip,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Even there where merchants most do congregate,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>If I forgive him!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>                  Shylock, do you hear?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>I am debating of my present store,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And, by the near guess of my memory,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>I cannot instantly raise up the gross</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Will furnish me. But soft! how many months</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Do you desire?</span><br/>
<p><em>To ANTONIO</em></p>
<span id='56'>Rest you fair, good signior;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Your worship was the last man in our mouths.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow</span><br/>
<span id='59'>By taking nor by giving of excess,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd</span><br/>
<span id='62'>How much ye would?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>                  Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>And for three months.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>I had forgot; three months; you told me so.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Upon advantage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>                  I do never use it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>This Jacob from our holy Abram was,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>The third possessor; ay, he was the third&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>And what of him? did he take interest?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>No, not take interest, not, as you would say,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>When Laban and himself were compromised</span><br/>
<span id='78'>That all the weanlings which were streak'd and pied</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>In the end of autumn turned to the rams,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And, when the work of generation was</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Between these woolly breeders in the act,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And, in the doing of the deed of kind,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Who then conceiving did in eaning time</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>A thing not in his power to bring to pass,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Was this inserted to make interest good?</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>But note me, signior.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Mark you this, Bassanio,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>An evil soul producing holy witness</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>A goodly apple rotten at the heart:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Signior Antonio, many a time and oft</span><br/>
<span id='107'>In the Rialto you have rated me</span><br/>
<span id='108'>About my moneys and my usances:</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>And all for use of that which is mine own.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Well then, it now appears you need my help:</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Go to, then; you come to me, and you say</span><br/>
<span id='116'>'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>You, that did void your rheum upon my beard</span><br/>
<span id='118'>And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Over your threshold: moneys is your suit</span><br/>
<span id='120'>What should I say to you? Should I not say</span><br/>
<span id='121'>'Hath a dog money? is it possible</span><br/>
<span id='122'>A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>With bated breath and whispering humbleness, say this;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;</span><br/>
<span id='126'>You spurn'd me such a day; another time</span><br/>
<span id='127'>You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies</span><br/>
<span id='128'>I'll lend you thus much moneys'?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>I am as like to call thee so again,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.</span><br/>
<span id='131'>If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not</span><br/>
<span id='132'>As to thy friends; for when did friendship take</span><br/>
<span id='133'>A breed for barren metal of his friend?</span><br/>
<span id='134'>But lend it rather to thine enemy,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Exact the penalty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>                  Why, look you, how you storm!</span><br/>
<span id='138'>I would be friends with you and have your love,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Supply your present wants and take no doit</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:</span><br/>
<span id='142'>This is kind I offer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>This were kindness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>This kindness will I show.</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Go with me to a notary, seal me there</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>If you repay me not on such a day,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>In such a place, such sum or sums as are</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Be nominated for an equal pound</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken</span><br/>
<span id='152'>In what part of your body pleaseth me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond</span><br/>
<span id='154'>And say there is much kindness in the Jew.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>You shall not seal to such a bond for me:</span><br/>
<span id='156'>I'll rather dwell in my necessity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Within these two months, that's a month before</span><br/>
<span id='159'>This bond expires, I do expect return</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Of thrice three times the value of this bond.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>O father Abram, what these Christians are,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect</span><br/>
<span id='163'>The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;</span><br/>
<span id='164'>If he should break his day, what should I gain</span><br/>
<span id='165'>By the exaction of the forfeiture?</span><br/>
<span id='166'>A pound of man's flesh taken from a man</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Is not so estimable, profitable neither,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:</span><br/>
<span id='170'>If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;</span><br/>
<span id='171'>And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Give him direction for this merry bond,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>And I will go and purse the ducats straight,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>See to my house, left in the fearful guard</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Of an unthrifty knave, and presently</span><br/>
<span id='178'>I will be with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Hie thee, gentle Jew.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Shylock</em></p>
<span id='180'>The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>Come on: in this there can be no dismay;</span><br/>
<span id='183'>My ships come home a month before the day.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Henry IV, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene III</H3>
<h4>Warkworth. Before the castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter NORTHUMBERLAND, LADY NORTHUMBERLAND, and LADY PERCY</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I pray thee, loving wife, and gentle daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Give even way unto my rough affairs:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Put not you on the visage of the times</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And be like them to Percy troublesome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LADY NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>I have given over, I will speak no more:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And, but my going, nothing can redeem it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LADY PERCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>O yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!</span><br/>
<span id='10'>The time was, father, that you broke your word,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>When you were more endeared to it than now;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>When your own Percy, when my heart's dear Harry,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Threw many a northward look to see his father</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Who then persuaded you to stay at home?</span><br/>
<span id='16'>There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!</span><br/>
<span id='18'>For his, it stuck upon him as the sun</span><br/>
<span id='19'>In the grey vault of heaven, and by his light</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Did all the chivalry of England move</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To do brave acts: he was indeed the glass</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>He had no legs that practised not his gait;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Became the accents of the valiant;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>For those that could speak low and tardily</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Would turn their own perfection to abuse,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>In diet, in affections of delight,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>In military rules, humours of blood,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>He was the mark and glass, copy and book,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>That fashion'd others. And him, O wondrous him!</span><br/>
<span id='33'>O miracle of men! him did you leave,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Second to none, unseconded by you,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>To look upon the hideous god of war</span><br/>
<span id='36'>In disadvantage; to abide a field</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Did seem defensible: so you left him.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong</span><br/>
<span id='40'>To hold your honour more precise and nice</span><br/>
<span id='41'>With others than with him! let them alone:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>The marshal and the archbishop are strong:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>To-day might I, hanging on Hotspur's neck,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Have talk'd of Monmouth's grave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Beshrew your heart,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me</span><br/>
<span id='48'>With new lamenting ancient oversights.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>But I must go and meet with danger there,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Or it will seek me in another place</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And find me worse provided.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LADY NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>O, fly to Scotland,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Till that the nobles and the armed commons</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Have of their puissance made a little taste.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LADY PERCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>If they get ground and vantage of the king,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Then join you with them, like a rib of steel,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>First let them try themselves. So did your son;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>He was so suffer'd: so came I a widow;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And never shall have length of life enough</span><br/>
<span id='61'>To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>For recordation to my noble husband.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my mind</span><br/>
<span id='65'>As with the tide swell'd up unto his height,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>That makes a still-stand, running neither way:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Fain would I go to meet the archbishop,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>But many thousand reasons hold me back.</span><br/>
<span id='69'>I will resolve for Scotland: there am I,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Till time and vantage crave my company.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Macbeth</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene V</h3>
<h4>Dunsinane. Within the castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter MACBETH, SEYTON, and Soldiers, with drum and colours</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Hang out our banners on the outward walls;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Till famine and the ague eat them up:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Were they not forced with those that should be ours,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And beat them backward home.</span><br/>
<p><em>A cry of women within</em></p>
<span id='8'>What is that noise?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SEYTON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>It is the cry of women, my good lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>I have almost forgot the taste of fears;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>The time has been, my senses would have cool'd</span><br/>
<span id='12'>To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir</span><br/>
<span id='14'>As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Cannot once start me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter SEYTON</em></p>
<span id='17'>Wherefore was that cry?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SEYTON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>The queen, my lord, is dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>She should have died hereafter;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>There would have been a time for such a word.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Creeps in this petty pace from day to day</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To the last syllable of recorded time,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And all our yesterdays have lighted fools</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player</span><br/>
<span id='27'>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And then is heard no more: it is a tale</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Signifying nothing.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
<span id='31'>Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Gracious my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>I should report that which I say I saw,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>But know not how to do it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Well, say, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>As I did stand my watch upon the hill,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>The wood began to move.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Liar and slave!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Within this three mile may you see it coming;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>I say, a moving grove.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>If thou speak'st false,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>I care not if thou dost for me as much.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I pull in resolution, and begin</span><br/>
<span id='48'>To doubt the equivocation of the fiend</span><br/>
<span id='49'>That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Do come to Dunsinane:'  and now a wood</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!</span><br/>
<span id='52'>If this which he avouches does appear,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>I 'gin to be aweary of the sun,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!</span><br/>
<span id='57'>At least we'll die with harness on our back.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Timon of Athens</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</h3>
<h4>A banqueting-room in Timon's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet  served in; FLAVIUS and others attending; then enter  TIMON, ALCIBIADES, Lords, Senators, and VENTIDIUS.  Then comes, dropping, after all, APEMANTUS, discontentedly, like himself</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>VENTIDIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Most honour'd Timon,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And call him to long peace.</span><br/>
<span id='4'>He is gone happy, and has left me rich:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound</span><br/>
<span id='6'>To your free heart, I do return those talents,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help</span><br/>
<span id='8'>I derived liberty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>TIMON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>                  O, by no means,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>I gave it freely ever; and there's none</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Can truly say he gives, if he receives:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>If our betters play at that game, we must not dare</span><br/>
<span id='14'>To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>VENTIDIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>A noble spirit!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>TIMON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>                  Nay, my lords,</span><br/>
<p><em>They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON</em></p>
<span id='17'>Ceremony was but devised at first</span><br/>
<span id='18'>To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>But where there is true friendship, there needs none.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Than my fortunes to me.</span><br/>
<p><em>They sit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Lord</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>My lord, we always have confess'd it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>APEMANTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>TIMON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>O, Apemantus, you are welcome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>APEMANTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>No;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>You shall not make me welcome:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>TIMON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Fie, thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour there</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Does not become a man: 'tis much to blame.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est;' but yond</span><br/>
<span id='32'>man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by</span><br/>
<span id='33'>himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is</span><br/>
<span id='34'>he fit for't, indeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>APEMANTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come to</span><br/>
<span id='36'>observe; I give thee warning on't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>TIMON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>prithee, let my meat make thee silent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>APEMANTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should</span><br/>
<span id='41'>ne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of</span><br/>
<span id='42'>men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves me</span><br/>
<span id='43'>to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Methinks they should invite them without knives;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>There's much example for't; the fellow that sits</span><br/>
<span id='49'>next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the</span><br/>
<span id='50'>breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest</span><br/>
<span id='51'>man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a</span><br/>
<span id='52'>huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Great men should drink with harness on their throats.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>TIMON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Second Lord</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Let it flow this way, my good lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>APEMANTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides</span><br/>
<span id='58'>well. Those healths will make thee and thy state</span><br/>
<span id='59'>look ill, Timon. Here's that which is too weak to</span><br/>
<span id='60'>be a sinner, honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>This and my food are equals; there's no odds:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Apemantus' grace.</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>I pray for no man but myself:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Grant I may never prove so fond,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>To trust man on his oath or bond;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Or a harlot, for her weeping;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Or a keeper with my freedom;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Or my friends, if I should need 'em.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Amen. So fall to't:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Rich men sin, and I eat root.</span><br/>
<p><em>Eats and drinks</em></p>
<span id='74'>Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>TIMON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>My heart is ever at your service, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>TIMON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a</span><br/>
<span id='78'>dinner of friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>So the were bleeding-new, my lord, there's no meat</span><br/>
<span id='80'>like 'em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>APEMANTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>First Lord</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you</span><br/>
<span id='84'>would once use our hearts, whereby we might express</span><br/>
<span id='85'>some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves</span><br/>
<span id='86'>for ever perfect.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>TIMON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods</span><br/>
<span id='88'>themselves have provided that I shall have much help</span><br/>
<span id='89'>from you: how had you been my friends else? why</span><br/>
<span id='90'>have you that charitable title from thousands, did</span><br/>
<span id='91'>not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told</span><br/>
<span id='92'>more of you to myself than you can with modesty</span><br/>
<span id='93'>speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm</span><br/>
<span id='94'>you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any</span><br/>
<span id='95'>friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they</span><br/>
<span id='96'>were the most needless creatures living, should we</span><br/>
<span id='97'>ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble</span><br/>
<span id='98'>sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their</span><br/>
<span id='99'>sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished</span><br/>
<span id='100'>myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We</span><br/>
<span id='101'>are born to do benefits: and what better or</span><br/>
<span id='102'>properer can we can our own than the riches of our</span><br/>
<span id='103'>friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have</span><br/>
<span id='104'>so many, like brothers, commanding one another's</span><br/>
<span id='105'>fortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to</span><br/>
<span id='107'>forget their faults, I drink to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>APEMANTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Second Lord</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Joy had the like conception in our eyes</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And at that instant like a babe sprung up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>APEMANTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Third Lord</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>APEMANTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Much!</span><br/>
<p><em>Tucket, within</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>TIMON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>What means that trump?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Servant</em></p>
<span id='115'>How now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Please you, my lord, there are certain</span><br/>
<span id='117'>ladies most desirous of admittance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>TIMON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Ladies! what are their wills?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which</span><br/>
<span id='120'>bears that office, to signify their pleasures.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>TIMON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>I pray, let them be admitted.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Cupid</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>Cupid</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all</span><br/>
<span id='123'>That of his bounties taste! The five best senses</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Acknowledge thee their patron; and come freely</span><br/>
<span id='125'>To gratulate thy plenteous bosom: th' ear,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Taste, touch and smell, pleased from thy tale rise;</span><br/>
<span id='127'>They only now come but to feast thine eyes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>TIMON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>They're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance:</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Music, make their welcome!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Cupid</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>First Lord</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>You see, my lord, how ample you're beloved.</span><br/>
<p><em>Music. Re-enter Cupid with a mask of Ladies  as Amazons, with lutes in their hands, dancing and playing</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>APEMANTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!</span><br/>
<span id='132'>They dance! they are mad women.</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Like madness is the glory of this life.</span><br/>
<span id='134'>As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.</span><br/>
<span id='135'>We make ourselves fools, to disport ourselves;</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And spend our flatteries, to drink those men</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Upon whose age we void it up again,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>With poisonous spite and envy.</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Of their friends' gift?</span><br/>
<span id='142'>I should fear those that dance before me now</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Would one day stamp upon me: 't has been done;</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Men shut their doors against a setting sun.</span><br/>
<p><em>The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of  TIMON; and to show their loves, each singles out an  Amazon, and all dance, men with women, a lofty strain or two to the hautboys, and cease</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>TIMON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Which was not half so beautiful and kind;</span><br/>
<span id='148'>You have added worth unto 't and lustre,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>And entertain'd me with mine own device;</span><br/>
<span id='150'>I am to thank you for 't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>First Lady</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>My lord, you take us even at the best.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>APEMANTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>'Faith, for the worst is filthy; and would not hold</span><br/>
<span id='153'>taking, I doubt me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>TIMON</strong></a>

<span id='154'>Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you:</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Please you to dispose yourselves.</span><br/>

<span id='speech77'><strong>APEMANTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='243'>What a coil's here!</span><br/>
<span id='244'>Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!</span><br/>
<span id='245'>I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums</span><br/>
<span id='246'>That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:</span><br/>
<span id='247'>Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs,</span><br/>
<span id='248'>Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies.</span><br/>

<span id='249'>Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen, I would be</span><br/>

<span id='251'>No, I'll nothing: for if I should be bribed too,</span><br/>

<span id='254'>Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in</span><br/>

<span id='257'>Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am</span><br/>

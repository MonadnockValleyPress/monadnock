<span id='speech1'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I have been studying how I may compare</span><br/>
<span id='2'>This prison where I live unto the world:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And for because the world is populous</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And here is not a creature but myself,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>My soul the father; and these two beget</span><br/>
<span id='8'>A generation of still-breeding thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And these same thoughts people this little world,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>In humours like the people of this world,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>For no thought is contented. The better sort,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd</span><br/>
<span id='13'>With scruples and do set the word itself</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Against the word:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>'It is as hard to come as for a camel</span><br/>
<span id='17'>To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails</span><br/>
<span id='20'>May tear a passage through the flinty ribs</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves</span><br/>
<span id='24'>That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>That many have and others must sit there;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And in this thought they find a kind of ease,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Bearing their own misfortunes on the back</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Of such as have before endured the like.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Thus play I in one person many people,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And none contented: sometimes am I king;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And so I am: then crushing penury</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Persuades me I was better when a king;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Then am I king'd again: and by and by</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Nor I nor any man that but man is</span><br/>
<span id='40'>With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased</span><br/>
<span id='41'>With being nothing. Music do I hear?</span><br/>
<p><em>Music</em></p>
<span id='42'>Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>When time is broke and no proportion kept!</span><br/>
<span id='44'>So is it in the music of men's lives.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And here have I the daintiness of ear</span><br/>
<span id='46'>To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>But for the concord of my state and time</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>For now hath time made me his numbering clock:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>This music mads me; let it sound no more;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>For though it have holp madmen to their wits,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>In me it seems it will make wise men mad.</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!</span><br/>
<span id='65'>For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Groom of the Stable</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Groom</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Hail, royal prince!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Thanks, noble peer;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>What art thou? and how comest thou hither,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Where no man never comes but that sad dog</span><br/>
<span id='72'>That brings me food to make misfortune live?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Groom</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>With much ado at length have gotten leave</span><br/>
<span id='76'>To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld</span><br/>
<span id='78'>In London streets, that coronation-day,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>How went he under him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Groom</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!</span><br/>
<span id='86'>That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Of that proud man that did usurp his back?</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Since thou, created to be awed by man,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Keeper, with a dish</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Keeper</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Groom</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Keeper</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>My lord, will't please you to fall to?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Keeper</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who</span><br/>
<span id='102'>lately came from the king, commands the contrary.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Beats the keeper</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Keeper</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Help, help, help!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter EXTON and Servants, armed</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>How now! what means death in this rude assault?</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.</span><br/>
<p><em>Snatching an axe from a Servant and killing him</em></p>
<span id='108'>Go thou, and fill another room in hell.</span><br/>
<p><em>He kills another. Then Exton strikes him down</em></p>
<span id='109'>That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire</span><br/>
<span id='110'>That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.</span><br/>
<p><em>Dies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>EXTON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>As full of valour as of royal blood:</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!</span><br/>
<span id='116'>For now the devil, that told me I did well,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>This dead king to the living king I'll bear</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

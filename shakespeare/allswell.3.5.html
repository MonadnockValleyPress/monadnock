<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene V</h3>
<h4>Florence. Without the walls. A tucket afar off.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter an old Widow of Florence, DIANA, VIOLENTA, and MARIANA, with other Citizens</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we</span><br/>
<span id='2'>shall lose all the sight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>They say the French count has done most honourable service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>It is reported that he has taken their greatest</span><br/>
<span id='5'>commander; and that with his own hand he slew the</span><br/>
<span id='6'>duke's brother.</span><br/>
<p><em>Tucket</em></p>
<span id='7'>We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary</span><br/>
<span id='8'>way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MARIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with</span><br/>
<span id='10'>the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this</span><br/>
<span id='11'>French earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and</span><br/>
<span id='12'>no legacy is so rich as honesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited</span><br/>
<span id='14'>by a gentleman his companion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>MARIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a</span><br/>
<span id='16'>filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the</span><br/>
<span id='17'>young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of</span><br/>
<span id='19'>lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid</span><br/>
<span id='20'>hath been seduced by them; and the misery is,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of</span><br/>
<span id='22'>maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten</span><br/>
<span id='24'>them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but</span><br/>
<span id='25'>I hope your own grace will keep you where you are,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>though there were no further danger known but the</span><br/>
<span id='27'>modesty which is so lost.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>You shall not need to fear me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>I hope so.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HELENA, disguised like a Pilgrim</em></p>
<span id='30'>Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at</span><br/>
<span id='31'>my house; thither they send one another: I'll</span><br/>
<span id='32'>question her. God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>To Saint Jaques le Grand.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>At the Saint Francis here beside the port.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Is this the way?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Ay, marry, is't.</span><br/>
<p><em>A march afar</em></p>
<span id='38'>Hark you! they come this way.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>But till the troops come by,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>The rather, for I think I know your hostess</span><br/>
<span id='43'>As ample as myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Is it yourself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>If you shall please so, pilgrim.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>You came, I think, from France?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>I did so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Here you shall see a countryman of yours</span><br/>
<span id='50'>That has done worthy service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>His name, I pray you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>His face I know not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Whatsome'er he is,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>As 'tis reported, for the king had married him</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Against his liking: think you it is so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>There is a gentleman that serves the count</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Reports but coarsely of her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>What's his name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Monsieur Parolles.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>                  O, I believe with him,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>In argument of praise, or to the worth</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Of the great count himself, she is too mean</span><br/>
<span id='67'>To have her name repeated: all her deserving</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Is a reserved honesty, and that</span><br/>
<span id='69'>I have not heard examined.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Alas, poor lady!</span><br/>
<span id='71'>'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Of a detesting lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her</span><br/>
<span id='75'>A shrewd turn, if she pleased.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>How do you mean?</span><br/>
<span id='77'>May be the amorous count solicits her</span><br/>
<span id='78'>In the unlawful purpose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>He does indeed;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And brokes with all that can in such a suit</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard</span><br/>
<span id='83'>In honestest defence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MARIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>The gods forbid else!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>So, now they come:</span><br/>
<p><em>Drum and Colours</em></p>
<p><em>Enter BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the whole army</em></p>
<span id='86'>That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>That, Escalus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>                  Which is the Frenchman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>He;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>I would he loved his wife: if he were honester</span><br/>
<span id='92'>He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>I like him well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave</span><br/>
<span id='95'>That leads him to these places: were I his lady,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>I would Poison that vile rascal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Which is he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Lose our drum! well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MARIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>He's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Marry, hang you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MARIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and army</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents</span><br/>
<span id='106'>There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Already at my house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>I humbly thank you:</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Please it this matron and this gentle maid</span><br/>
<span id='110'>To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Shall be for me; and, to requite you further,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>I will bestow some precepts of this virgin</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Worthy the note.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BOTH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>                  We'll take your offer kindly.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

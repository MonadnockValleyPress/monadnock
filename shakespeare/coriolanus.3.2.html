<h1>Coriolanus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</H3>
<h4>A room in Coriolanus's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CORIOLANUS with Patricians</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Let them puff all about mine ears, present me</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>That the precipitation might down stretch</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Below the beam of sight, yet will I still</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Be thus to them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>A Patrician</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>You do the nobler.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>I muse my mother</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Does not approve me further, who was wont</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To call them woollen vassals, things created</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads</span><br/>
<span id='12'>In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>When one but of my ordinance stood up</span><br/>
<span id='14'>To speak of peace or war.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter VOLUMNIA</em></p>
<span id='15'>I talk of you:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Why did you wish me milder? would you have me</span><br/>
<span id='17'>False to my nature? Rather say I play</span><br/>
<span id='18'>The man I am.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>                  O, sir, sir, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>I would have had you put your power well on,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Before you had worn it out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Let go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>You might have been enough the man you are,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>With striving less to be so; lesser had been</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The thwartings of your dispositions, if</span><br/>
<span id='26'>You had not show'd them how ye were disposed</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Ere they lack'd power to cross you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Let them hang.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>A Patrician</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Ay, and burn too.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MENENIUS and Senators</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Come, come, you have been too rough, something</span><br/>
<span id='31'>too rough;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>You must return and mend it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>First Senator</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>There's no remedy;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Unless, by not so doing, our good city</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Cleave in the midst, and perish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Pray, be counsell'd:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>I have a heart as little apt as yours,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>But yet a brain that leads my use of anger</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To better vantage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>                  Well said, noble woman?</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that</span><br/>
<span id='42'>The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic</span><br/>
<span id='43'>For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Which I can scarcely bear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>What must I do?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Return to the tribunes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Well, what then? what then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Repent what you have spoke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>For them! I cannot do it to the gods;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Must I then do't to them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>You are too absolute;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Though therein you can never be too noble,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>In peace what each of them by the other lose,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>That they combine not there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Tush, tush!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>A good demand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>If it be honour in your wars to seem</span><br/>
<span id='61'>The same you are not, which, for your best ends,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>That it shall hold companionship in peace</span><br/>
<span id='64'>With honour, as in war, since that to both</span><br/>
<span id='65'>It stands in like request?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Why force you this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Because that now it lies you on to speak</span><br/>
<span id='68'>To the people; not by your own instruction,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>But with such words that are but rooted in</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Now, this no more dishonours you at all</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Than to take in a town with gentle words,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Which else would put you to your fortune and</span><br/>
<span id='76'>The hazard of much blood.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>I would dissemble with my nature where</span><br/>
<span id='78'>My fortunes and my friends at stake required</span><br/>
<span id='79'>I should do so in honour: I am in this,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And you will rather show our general louts</span><br/>
<span id='82'>How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Of what that want might ruin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Noble lady!</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Not what is dangerous present, but the loss</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Of what is past.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>                  I prithee now, my son,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And thus far having stretch'd it&mdash;here be with them&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Thy knee bussing the stones&mdash;for in such business</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant</span><br/>
<span id='94'>More learned than the ears&mdash;waving thy head,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Now humble as the ripest mulberry</span><br/>
<span id='97'>That will not hold the handling: or say to them,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far</span><br/>
<span id='103'>As thou hast power and person.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>This but done,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free</span><br/>
<span id='107'>As words to little purpose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Prithee now,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter COMINIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit</span><br/>
<span id='113'>You make strong party, or defend yourself</span><br/>
<span id='114'>By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Only fair speech.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>                  I think 'twill serve, if he</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Can thereto frame his spirit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>He must, and will</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Must I with base tongue give my noble heart</span><br/>
<span id='122'>A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!</span><br/>
<span id='126'>You have put me now to such a part which never</span><br/>
<span id='127'>I shall discharge to the life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Come, come, we'll prompt you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said</span><br/>
<span id='130'>My praises made thee first a soldier, so,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>To have my praise for this, perform a part</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Thou hast not done before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Well, I must do't:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Away, my disposition, and possess me</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Which quired with my drum, into a pipe</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice</span><br/>
<span id='138'>That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up</span><br/>
<span id='140'>The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his</span><br/>
<span id='143'>That hath received an alms! I will not do't,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And by my body's action teach my mind</span><br/>
<span id='146'>A most inherent baseness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>At thy choice, then:</span><br/>
<span id='148'>To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death</span><br/>
<span id='152'>With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>But owe thy pride thyself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>Pray, be content:</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Mother, I am going to the market-place;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Or never trust to what my tongue can do</span><br/>
<span id='162'>I' the way of flattery further.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Do your will.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself</span><br/>
<span id='165'>To answer mildly; for they are prepared</span><br/>
<span id='166'>With accusations, as I hear, more strong</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Than are upon you yet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Let them accuse me by invention, I</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Will answer in mine honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Ay, but mildly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

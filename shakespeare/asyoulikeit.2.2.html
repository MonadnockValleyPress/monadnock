<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</H3>
<h4>A room in the palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUKE FREDERICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Can it be possible that no man saw them?</span><br/>
<span id='2'>It cannot be: some villains of my court</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Are of consent and sufferance in this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Lord</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>I cannot hear of any that did see her.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Saw her abed, and in the morning early</span><br/>
<span id='7'>They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>Second Lord</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Confesses that she secretly o'erheard</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Your daughter and her cousin much commend</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The parts and graces of the wrestler</span><br/>
<span id='14'>That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And she believes, wherever they are gone,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>That youth is surely in their company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DUKE FREDERICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>If he be absent, bring his brother to me;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And let not search and inquisition quail</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To bring again these foolish runaways.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

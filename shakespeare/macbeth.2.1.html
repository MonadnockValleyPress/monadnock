<h1>Macbeth</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Court of Macbeth's castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE bearing a torch before him</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>How goes the night, boy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>FLEANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>And she goes down at twelve.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>FLEANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>I take't, 'tis later, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Gives way to in repose!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch</em></p>
<span id='11'>Give me my sword.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Who's there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>A friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>He hath been in unusual pleasure, and</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Sent forth great largess to your offices.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>This diamond he greets your wife withal,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up</span><br/>
<span id='19'>In measureless content.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Being unprepared,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Our will became the servant to defect;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Which else should free have wrought.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>All's well.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>To you they have show'd some truth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>I think not of them:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>We would spend it in some words upon that business,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>If you would grant the time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>At your kind'st leisure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>It shall make honour for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>So I lose none</span><br/>
<span id='34'>In seeking to augment it, but still keep</span><br/>
<span id='35'>My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>I shall be counsell'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Good repose the while!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Thanks, sir: the like to you!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Servant</em></p>
<span id='41'>Is this a dagger which I see before me,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible</span><br/>
<span id='45'>To feeling as to sight? or art thou but</span><br/>
<span id='46'>A dagger of the mind, a false creation,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?</span><br/>
<span id='48'>I see thee yet, in form as palpable</span><br/>
<span id='49'>As this which now I draw.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And such an instrument I was to use.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Which was not so before. There's no such thing:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>It is the bloody business which informs</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse</span><br/>
<span id='59'>The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And take the present horror from the time,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.</span><br/>
<p><em>A bell rings</em></p>
<span id='70'>I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell</span><br/>
<span id='72'>That summons thee to heaven or to hell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<h1>Richard III</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The same. Another street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth, Gentlemen with halberds to guard it; LADY ANNE being the mourner</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Set down, set down your honourable load,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament</span><br/>
<span id='4'>The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!</span><br/>
<span id='17'>More direful hap betide that hated wretch,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>That makes us wretched by the death of thee,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!</span><br/>
<span id='21'>If ever he have child, abortive be it,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Whose ugly and unnatural aspect</span><br/>
<span id='24'>May fright the hopeful mother at the view;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And that be heir to his unhappiness!</span><br/>
<span id='26'>If ever he have wife, let her he made</span><br/>
<span id='27'>A miserable by the death of him</span><br/>
<span id='28'>As I am made by my poor lord and thee!</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Taken from Paul's to be interred there;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And still, as you are weary of the weight,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GLOUCESTER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>What black magician conjures up this fiend,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>To stop devoted charitable deeds?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood</span><br/>
<span id='59'>From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Provokes this deluge most unnatural.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!</span><br/>
<span id='63'>O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Either heaven with lightning strike the</span><br/>
<span id='65'>murderer dead,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Lady, you know no rules of charity,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>But I know none, and therefore am no beast.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>More wonderful, when angels are so angry.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>By circumstance, but to acquit myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>For these known evils, but to give me leave,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Some patient leisure to excuse myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make</span><br/>
<span id='85'>No excuse current, but to hang thyself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>By such despair, I should accuse myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Say that I slew them not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Why, then they are not dead:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>I did not kill your husband.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Why, then he is alive.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>The which thou once didst bend against her breast,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>But that thy brothers beat aside the point.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Didst thou not kill this king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>I grant ye.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!</span><br/>
<span id='108'>O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>For he was fitter for that place than earth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>And thou unfit for any place but hell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Some dungeon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>                             Your bed-chamber.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>So will it, madam till I lie with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>I hope so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>To leave this keen encounter of our wits,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And fall somewhat into a slower method,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Is not the causer of the timeless deaths</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>As blameful as the executioner?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Your beauty was the cause of that effect;</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep</span><br/>
<span id='129'>To undertake the death of all the world,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;</span><br/>
<span id='134'>You should not blemish it, if I stood by:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>As all the world is cheered by the sun,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>So I by that; it is my day, my life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>I would I were, to be revenged on thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>It is a quarrel most unnatural,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>To be revenged on him that loveth you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>It is a quarrel just and reasonable,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>To be revenged on him that slew my husband.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Did it to help thee to a better husband.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>His better doth not breathe upon the earth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>He lives that loves thee better than he could.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Name him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>        Plantagenet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Why, that was he.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>The selfsame name, but one of better nature.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Where is he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>                 Here.</span><br/>
<p><em>She spitteth at him</em></p>
<span id='154'>Why dost thou spit at me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Never came poison from so sweet a place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Never hung poison on a fouler toad.</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>I would they were, that I might die at once;</span><br/>
<span id='162'>For now they kill me with a living death.</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:</span><br/>
<span id='165'>These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>No, when my father York and Edward wept,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made</span><br/>
<span id='168'>When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Told the sad story of my father's death,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time</span><br/>
<span id='174'>My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;</span><br/>
<span id='175'>And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.</span><br/>
<span id='177'>I never sued to friend nor enemy;</span><br/>
<span id='178'>My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;</span><br/>
<span id='179'>But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.</span><br/>
<p><em>She looks scornfully at him</em></p>
<span id='181'>Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made</span><br/>
<span id='182'>For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.</span><br/>
<span id='183'>If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.</span><br/>
<span id='186'>And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>And humbly beg the death upon my knee.</span><br/>
<p><em>He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword</em></p>
<span id='189'>Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.</span><br/>
<p><em>Here she lets fall the sword</em></p>
<span id='193'>Take up the sword again, or take up me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>I will not be the executioner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>I have already.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>                  Tush, that was in thy rage:</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Speak it again, and, even with the word,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;</span><br/>
<span id='202'>To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>I would I knew thy heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>'Tis figured in my tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>I fear me both are false.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>Then never man was true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='207'>Well, well, put up your sword.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>Say, then, my peace is made.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='209'>That shall you know hereafter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>But shall I live in hope?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='211'>All men, I hope, live so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='212'>Vouchsafe to wear this ring.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='213'>To take is not to give.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;</span><br/>
<span id='216'>Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.</span><br/>
<span id='217'>And if thy poor devoted suppliant may</span><br/>
<span id='218'>But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='220'>What is it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>That it would please thee leave these sad designs</span><br/>
<span id='222'>To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,</span><br/>
<span id='223'>And presently repair to Crosby Place;</span><br/>
<span id='224'>Where, after I have solemnly interr'd</span><br/>
<span id='225'>At Chertsey monastery this noble king,</span><br/>
<span id='226'>And wet his grave with my repentant tears,</span><br/>
<span id='227'>I will with all expedient duty see you:</span><br/>
<span id='228'>For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,</span><br/>
<span id='229'>Grant me this boon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='230'>With all my heart; and much it joys me too,</span><br/>
<span id='231'>To see you are become so penitent.</span><br/>
<span id='232'>Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='233'>Bid me farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='234'>'Tis more than you deserve;</span><br/>
<span id='235'>But since you teach me how to flatter you,</span><br/>
<span id='236'>Imagine I have said farewell already.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt LADY ANNE, TRESSEL, and BERKELEY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='237'>Sirs, take up the corse.</span><br/>

<span id='speech87'><strong>GENTLEMEN</strong></span>

<span id='239'>No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER</em></p>
<span id='240'>Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?</span><br/>
<span id='241'>Was ever woman in this humour won?</span><br/>
<span id='242'>I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.</span><br/>
<span id='243'>What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,</span><br/>
<span id='244'>To take her in her heart's extremest hate,</span><br/>
<span id='245'>With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='246'>The bleeding witness of her hatred by;</span><br/>
<span id='247'>Having God, her conscience, and these bars</span><br/>
<span id='248'>against me,</span><br/>
<span id='249'>And I nothing to back my suit at all,</span><br/>
<span id='250'>But the plain devil and dissembling looks,</span><br/>
<span id='251'>And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!</span><br/>
<span id='252'>Ha!</span><br/>
<span id='253'>Hath she forgot already that brave prince,</span><br/>
<span id='254'>Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,</span><br/>
<span id='255'>Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?</span><br/>
<span id='256'>A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,</span><br/>
<span id='257'>Framed in the prodigality of nature,</span><br/>
<span id='258'>Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,</span><br/>
<span id='259'>The spacious world cannot again afford</span><br/>
<span id='260'>And will she yet debase her eyes on me,</span><br/>
<span id='261'>That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,</span><br/>
<span id='262'>And made her widow to a woful bed?</span><br/>
<span id='263'>On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?</span><br/>
<span id='264'>On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?</span><br/>
<span id='265'>My dukedom to a beggarly denier,</span><br/>
<span id='266'>I do mistake my person all this while:</span><br/>
<span id='267'>Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,</span><br/>
<span id='268'>Myself to be a marvellous proper man.</span><br/>
<span id='269'>I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,</span><br/>
<span id='270'>And entertain some score or two of tailors,</span><br/>
<span id='271'>To study fashions to adorn my body:</span><br/>
<span id='272'>Since I am crept in favour with myself,</span><br/>
<span id='273'>Will maintain it with some little cost.</span><br/>
<span id='274'>But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;</span><br/>
<span id='275'>And then return lamenting to my love.</span><br/>
<span id='276'>Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,</span><br/>
<span id='277'>That I may see my shadow as I pass.</span><br/>

<h1>Richard III</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, RIVERS, and GREY</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>RIVERS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Will soon recover his accustom'd health.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>If he were dead, what would betide of me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>RIVERS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>No other harm but loss of such a lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>The loss of such a lord includes all harm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To be your comforter when he is gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Oh, he is young and his minority</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>A man that loves not me, nor none of you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>RIVERS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Is it concluded that he shall be protector?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>It is determined, not concluded yet:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>But so it must be, if the king miscarry.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Good time of day unto your royal grace!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DERBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>God make your majesty joyful as you have been!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I hate not you for her proud arrogance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DERBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>I do beseech you, either not believe</span><br/>
<span id='26'>The envious slanders of her false accusers;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Or, if she be accused in true report,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds</span><br/>
<span id='29'>From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>RIVERS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DERBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>But now the Duke of Buckingham and I</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Are come from visiting his majesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>What likelihood of his amendment, lords?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>God grant him health! Did you confer with him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And sent to warn them to his royal presence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Would all were well! but that will never be</span><br/>
<span id='41'>I fear our happiness is at the highest.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Who are they that complain unto the king,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?</span><br/>
<span id='45'>By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly</span><br/>
<span id='46'>That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>I must be held a rancorous enemy.</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>But thus his simple truth must be abused</span><br/>
<span id='53'>By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>RIVERS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?</span><br/>
<span id='58'>A plague upon you all! His royal person,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Whom God preserve better than you would wish!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>The king, of his own royal disposition,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And not provoked by any suitor else;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Which in your outward actions shows itself</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather</span><br/>
<span id='69'>The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Since every Jack became a gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='73'>There's many a gentle person made a Jack.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Come, come, we know your meaning, brother</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Gloucester;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>You envy my advancement and my friends':</span><br/>
<span id='77'>God grant we never may have need of you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Your brother is imprison'd by your means,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Myself disgraced, and the nobility</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Are daily given to ennoble those</span><br/>
<span id='83'>That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>By Him that raised me to this careful height</span><br/>
<span id='85'>From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>I never did incense his majesty</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been</span><br/>
<span id='88'>An earnest advocate to plead for him.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>My lord, you do me shameful injury,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>You may deny that you were not the cause</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>RIVERS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>She may, my lord, for&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?</span><br/>
<span id='95'>She may do more, sir, than denying that:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>She may help you to many fair preferments,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And then deny her aiding hand therein,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And lay those honours on your high deserts.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>RIVERS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>What, marry, may she?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>What, marry, may she! marry with a king,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:</span><br/>
<span id='103'>I wis your grandam had a worser match.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:</span><br/>
<span id='106'>By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty</span><br/>
<span id='107'>With those gross taunts I often have endured.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>I had rather be a country servant-maid</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Than a great queen, with this condition,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind</em></p>
<span id='111'>Small joy have I in being England's queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>What! threat you me with telling of the king?</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said</span><br/>
<span id='116'>I will avouch in presence of the king:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Out, devil! I remember them too well:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>A liberal rewarder of his friends:</span><br/>
<span id='126'>To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>In all which time you and your husband Grey</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Were factious for the house of Lancaster;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband</span><br/>
<span id='131'>In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Let me put in your minds, if you forget,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>What you have been ere now, and what you are;</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Withal, what I have been, and what I am.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>A murderous villain, and so still thou art.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Yea, and forswore himself,&mdash;which Jesu pardon!&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Which God revenge!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>To fight on Edward's party for the crown;</span><br/>
<span id='140'>And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.</span><br/>
<span id='141'>I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine.</span><br/>
<span id='143'>I am too childish-foolish for this world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>RIVERS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Which here you urge to prove us enemies,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:</span><br/>
<span id='149'>So should we you, if you should be our king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>As little joy, my lord, as you suppose</span><br/>
<span id='153'>You should enjoy, were you this country's king,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>As little joy may you suppose in me.</span><br/>
<span id='155'>That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>For I am she, and altogether joyless.</span><br/>
<span id='158'>I can no longer hold me patient.</span><br/>
<p><em>Advancing</em></p>
<span id='159'>Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out</span><br/>
<span id='160'>In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Which of you trembles not that looks on me?</span><br/>
<span id='162'>If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?</span><br/>
<span id='164'>O gentle villain, do not turn away!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>That will I make before I let thee go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Wert thou not banished on pain of death?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>I was; but I do find more pain in banishment</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Than death can yield me here by my abode.</span><br/>
<span id='171'>A husband and a son thou owest to me;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:</span><br/>
<span id='173'>The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>The curse my noble father laid on thee,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper</span><br/>
<span id='177'>And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='180'>His curses, then from bitterness of soul</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;</span><br/>
<span id='182'>And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>So just is God, to right the innocent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>RIVERS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>DORSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>No man but prophesied revenge for it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>What were you snarling all before I came,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Ready to catch each other by the throat,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>And turn you all your hatred now on me?</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?</span><br/>
<span id='193'>That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Could all but answer for that peevish brat?</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!</span><br/>
<span id='198'>If not by war, by surfeit die your king,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>As ours by murder, to make him a king!</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Die in his youth by like untimely violence!</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;</span><br/>
<span id='206'>And see another, as I see thee now,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Long die thy happy days before thy death;</span><br/>
<span id='209'>And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,</span><br/>
<span id='212'>And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son</span><br/>
<span id='213'>Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>That none of you may live your natural age,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>But by some unlook'd accident cut off!</span><br/>

<span id='220'>O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,</span><br/>
<span id='221'>And then hurl down their indignation</span><br/>

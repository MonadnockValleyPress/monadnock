<h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>A public place.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Thou art like one of those fellows that when he</span><br/>
<span id='6'>enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword</span><br/>
<span id='7'>upon the table and says 'God send me no need of</span><br/>
<span id='8'>thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws</span><br/>
<span id='9'>it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Am I like such a fellow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as</span><br/>
<span id='12'>any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as</span><br/>
<span id='13'>soon moody to be moved.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>And what to?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Nay, an there were two such, we should have none</span><br/>
<span id='16'>shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou</span><br/>
<span id='19'>wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no</span><br/>
<span id='20'>other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what</span><br/>
<span id='21'>eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of</span><br/>
<span id='23'>meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as</span><br/>
<span id='24'>an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a</span><br/>
<span id='25'>man for coughing in the street, because he hath</span><br/>
<span id='26'>wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing</span><br/>
<span id='28'>his new doublet before Easter? with another, for</span><br/>
<span id='29'>tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou</span><br/>
<span id='30'>wilt tutor me from quarrelling!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man</span><br/>
<span id='32'>should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>The fee-simple! O simple!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>By my head, here come the Capulets.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>By my heel, I care not.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter TYBALT and others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>TYBALT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Follow me close, for I will speak to them.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>And but one word with one of us? couple it with</span><br/>
<span id='39'>something; make it a word and a blow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>TYBALT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you</span><br/>
<span id='41'>will give me occasion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Could you not take some occasion without giving?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TYBALT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an</span><br/>
<span id='45'>thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but</span><br/>
<span id='46'>discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall</span><br/>
<span id='47'>make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>We talk here in the public haunt of men:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Either withdraw unto some private place,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And reason coldly of your grievances,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ROMEO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>TYBALT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>TYBALT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford</span><br/>
<span id='59'>No better term than this,&mdash;thou art a villain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Doth much excuse the appertaining rage</span><br/>
<span id='62'>To such a greeting: villain am I none;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>TYBALT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries</span><br/>
<span id='65'>That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>I do protest, I never injured thee,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>But love thee better than thou canst devise,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And so, good Capulet,&mdash;which name I tender</span><br/>
<span id='70'>As dearly as my own,&mdash;be satisfied.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Alla stoccata carries it away.</span><br/>
<p><em>Draws</em></p>
<span id='73'>Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>TYBALT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>What wouldst thou have with me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine</span><br/>
<span id='76'>lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you</span><br/>
<span id='77'>shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the</span><br/>
<span id='78'>eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher</span><br/>
<span id='79'>by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your</span><br/>
<span id='80'>ears ere it be out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>TYBALT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>I am for you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Drawing</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Come, sir, your passado.</span><br/>
<p><em>They fight</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!</span><br/>
<p><em>TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>I am hurt.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Is he gone, and hath nothing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>What, art thou hurt?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Page</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a</span><br/>
<span id='97'>church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for</span><br/>
<span id='98'>me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I</span><br/>
<span id='99'>am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'</span><br/>
<span id='100'>both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a</span><br/>
<span id='101'>cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a</span><br/>
<span id='102'>rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of</span><br/>
<span id='103'>arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I</span><br/>
<span id='104'>was hurt under your arm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>I thought all for the best.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Help me into some house, Benvolio,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!</span><br/>
<span id='108'>They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And soundly too: your houses!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>This gentleman, the prince's near ally,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt</span><br/>
<span id='112'>In my behalf; my reputation stain'd</span><br/>
<span id='113'>With Tybalt's slander,&mdash;Tybalt, that an hour</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Thy beauty hath made me effeminate</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter BENVOLIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!</span><br/>
<span id='118'>That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>This day's black fate on more days doth depend;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>This but begins the woe, others must end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Away to heaven, respective lenity,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter TYBALT</em></p>
<span id='126'>Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Is but a little way above our heads,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Staying for thine to keep him company:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>TYBALT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Shalt with him hence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>This shall determine that.</span><br/>
<p><em>They fight; TYBALT falls</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Romeo, away, be gone!</span><br/>
<span id='135'>The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>O, I am fortune's fool!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Why dost thou stay?</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit ROMEO</em></p>
<p><em>Enter Citizens,  & c</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>There lies that Tybalt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Up, sir, go with me;</span><br/>
<span id='144'>I charge thee in the princes name, obey.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>PRINCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Where are the vile beginners of this fray?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>O noble prince, I can discover all</span><br/>
<span id='147'>The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:</span><br/>
<span id='148'>There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!</span><br/>
<span id='151'>O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt</span><br/>
<span id='152'>O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.</span><br/>
<span id='154'>O cousin, cousin!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>PRINCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink</span><br/>
<span id='158'>How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Your high displeasure: all this uttered</span><br/>
<span id='160'>With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Could not take truce with the unruly spleen</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts</span><br/>
<span id='163'>With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Cold death aside, and with the other sends</span><br/>
<span id='167'>It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than</span><br/>
<span id='170'>his tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>His agile arm beats down their fatal points,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm</span><br/>
<span id='173'>An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;</span><br/>
<span id='175'>But by and by comes back to Romeo,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.</span><br/>
<span id='179'>And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.</span><br/>
<span id='180'>This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>He is a kinsman to the Montague;</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>And all those twenty could but kill one life.</span><br/>
<span id='185'>I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>PRINCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;</span><br/>
<span id='190'>His fault concludes but what the law should end,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>The life of Tybalt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>PRINCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>And for that offence</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Immediately we do exile him hence:</span><br/>
<span id='194'>I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;</span><br/>
<span id='196'>But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine</span><br/>
<span id='197'>That you shall all repent the loss of mine:</span><br/>
<span id='198'>I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Bear hence this body and attend our will:</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

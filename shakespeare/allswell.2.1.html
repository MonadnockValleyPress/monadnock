<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Paris. The King's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING, attended  with divers young Lords taking leave for the Florentine war; BERTRAM, and PAROLLES</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all</span><br/>
<span id='4'>The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And is enough for both.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>'Tis our hope, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>After well enter'd soldiers, to return</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And find your grace in health.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Will not confess he owes the malady</span><br/>
<span id='11'>That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Whether I live or die, be you the sons</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Those bated that inherit but the fall</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Of the last monarchy,&mdash;see that you come</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when</span><br/>
<span id='17'>The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>They say, our French lack language to deny,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>If they demand: beware of being captives,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Before you serve.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Both</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>                  Our hearts receive your warnings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Farewell. Come hither to me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit, attended</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>'Tis not his fault, the spark.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>O, 'tis brave wars!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Most admirable: I have seen those wars.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>I am commanded here, and kept a coil with</span><br/>
<span id='31'>'Too young' and 'the next year' and ''tis too early.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>An thy mind stand to't, boy, steal away bravely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Till honour be bought up and no sword worn</span><br/>
<span id='36'>But one to dance with! By heaven, I'll steal away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>There's honour in the theft.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Commit it, count.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>I am your accessary; and so, farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Farewell, captain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Sweet Monsieur Parolles!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good</span><br/>
<span id='44'>sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall</span><br/>
<span id='45'>find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here</span><br/>
<span id='47'>on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword</span><br/>
<span id='48'>entrenched it: say to him, I live; and observe his</span><br/>
<span id='49'>reports for me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>We shall, noble captain.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Lords</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Mars dote on you for his novices! what will ye do?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Stay: the king.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter KING. BERTRAM and PAROLLES retire</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>[To BERTRAM]  Use a more spacious ceremony to the</span><br/>
<span id='54'>noble lords; you have restrained yourself within the</span><br/>
<span id='55'>list of too cold an adieu: be more expressive to</span><br/>
<span id='56'>them: for they wear themselves in the cap of the</span><br/>
<span id='57'>time, there do muster true gait, eat, speak, and</span><br/>
<span id='58'>move under the influence of the most received star;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>and though the devil lead the measure, such are to</span><br/>
<span id='60'>be followed: after them, and take a more dilated farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>And I will do so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES</em></p>
<p><em>Enter LAFEU</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>[Kneeling]  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>I'll fee thee to stand up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Then here's a man stands, that has brought his pardon.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And that at my bidding you could so stand up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And ask'd thee mercy for't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Good faith, across: but, my good lord 'tis thus;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Will you be cured of your infirmity?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>No.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if</span><br/>
<span id='75'>My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine</span><br/>
<span id='76'>That's able to breathe life into a stone,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary</span><br/>
<span id='78'>With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And write to her a love-line.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>What 'her' is this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>If seriously I may convey my thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='86'>In this my light deliverance, I have spoke</span><br/>
<span id='87'>With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her</span><br/>
<span id='90'>For that is her demand, and know her business?</span><br/>
<span id='91'>That done, laugh well at me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Now, good Lafeu,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Bring in the admiration; that we with thee</span><br/>
<span id='94'>May spend our wonder too, or take off thine</span><br/>
<span id='95'>By wondering how thou took'st it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Nay, I'll fit you,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And not be all day neither.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter LAFEU, with HELENA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Nay, come your ways.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>This haste hath wings indeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Nay, come your ways:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>This is his majesty; say your mind to him:</span><br/>
<span id='103'>A traitor you do look like; but such traitors</span><br/>
<span id='104'>His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid's uncle,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>That dare leave two together; fare you well.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Now, fair one, does your business follow us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Ay, my good lord.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Gerard de Narbon was my father;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>In what he did profess, well found.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>I knew him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>The rather will I spare my praises towards him:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And of his old experience the oily darling,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>He bade me store up, as a triple eye,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>And hearing your high majesty is touch'd</span><br/>
<span id='119'>With that malignant cause wherein the honour</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>I come to tender it and my appliance</span><br/>
<span id='122'>With all bound humbleness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>We thank you, maiden;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>But may not be so credulous of cure,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>When our most learned doctors leave us and</span><br/>
<span id='126'>The congregated college have concluded</span><br/>
<span id='127'>That labouring art can never ransom nature</span><br/>
<span id='128'>From her inaidible estate; I say we must not</span><br/>
<span id='129'>So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>To prostitute our past-cure malady</span><br/>
<span id='131'>To empirics, or to dissever so</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Our great self and our credit, to esteem</span><br/>
<span id='133'>A senseless help when help past sense we deem.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>My duty then shall pay me for my pains:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>I will no more enforce mine office on you.</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='137'>A modest one, to bear me back again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful:</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give</span><br/>
<span id='140'>As one near death to those that wish him live:</span><br/>
<span id='141'>But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>I knowing all my peril, thou no art.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>What I can do can do no hurt to try,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.</span><br/>
<span id='145'>He that of greatest works is finisher</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Oft does them by the weakest minister:</span><br/>
<span id='147'>So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>When judges have been babes; great floods have flown</span><br/>
<span id='149'>From simple sources, and great seas have dried</span><br/>
<span id='150'>When miracles have by the greatest been denied.</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Oft expectation fails and most oft there</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Where most it promises, and oft it hits</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd:</span><br/>
<span id='158'>It is not so with Him that all things knows</span><br/>
<span id='159'>As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>But most it is presumption in us when</span><br/>
<span id='161'>The help of heaven we count the act of men.</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.</span><br/>
<span id='164'>I am not an impostor that proclaim</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Myself against the level of mine aim;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>But know I think and think I know most sure</span><br/>
<span id='167'>My art is not past power nor you past cure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Are thou so confident? within what space</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Hopest thou my cure?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>The great'st grace lending grace</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Ere twice in murk and occidental damp</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Health shall live free and sickness freely die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Upon thy certainty and confidence</span><br/>
<span id='180'>What darest thou venture?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>Tax of impudence,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Sear'd otherwise; nay, worse&mdash;if worse&mdash;extended</span><br/>
<span id='185'>With vilest torture let my life be ended.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak</span><br/>
<span id='187'>His powerful sound within an organ weak:</span><br/>
<span id='188'>And what impossibility would slay</span><br/>
<span id='189'>In common sense, sense saves another way.</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all</span><br/>
<span id='193'>That happiness and prime can happy call:</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Thou this to hazard needs must intimate</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>That ministers thine own death if I die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>If I break time, or flinch in property</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>And well deserved: not helping, death's my fee;</span><br/>
<span id='201'>But, if I help, what do you promise me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>Make thy demand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>                  But will you make it even?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand</span><br/>
<span id='206'>What husband in thy power I will command:</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Exempted be from me the arrogance</span><br/>
<span id='208'>To choose from forth the royal blood of France,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>My low and humble name to propagate</span><br/>
<span id='210'>With any branch or image of thy state;</span><br/>
<span id='211'>But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know</span><br/>

<span id='speech63'><strong>KING</strong></span>

<span id='213'>Here is my hand; the premises observed,</span><br/>

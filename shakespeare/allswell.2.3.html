<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Paris. The King's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>They say miracles are past; and we have our</span><br/>
<span id='2'>philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that</span><br/>
<span id='4'>we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves</span><br/>
<span id='5'>into seeming knowledge, when we should submit</span><br/>
<span id='6'>ourselves to an unknown fear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath</span><br/>
<span id='8'>shot out in our latter times.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>And so 'tis.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>To be relinquish'd of the artists,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>So I say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Both of Galen and Paracelsus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>So I say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Of all the learned and authentic fellows,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Right; so I say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>That gave him out incurable,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Why, there 'tis; so say I too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Not to be helped,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Right; as 'twere, a man assured of a&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Uncertain life, and sure death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Just, you say well; so would I have said.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you</span><br/>
<span id='24'>shall read it in&mdash;what do you call there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>That's it; I would have said the very same.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Why, your dolphin is not lustier: 'fore me,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I speak in respect&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange, that is the</span><br/>
<span id='30'>brief and the tedious of it; and he's of a most</span><br/>
<span id='31'>facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Very hand of heaven.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Ay, so I say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>In a most weak&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>pausing</em></p>
<span id='35'>and debile minister, great power, great</span><br/>
<span id='36'>transcendence: which should, indeed, give us a</span><br/>
<span id='37'>further use to be made than alone the recovery of</span><br/>
<span id='38'>the king, as to be&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>pausing</em></p>
<span id='39'>generally thankful.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter KING, HELENA, and Attendants. LAFEU and PAROLLES retire</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Lustig, as the Dutchman says: I'll like a maid the</span><br/>
<span id='42'>better, whilst I have a tooth in my head: why, he's</span><br/>
<span id='43'>able to lead her a coranto.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Mort du vinaigre! is not this Helen?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>'Fore God, I think so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Go, call before me all the lords in court.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive</span><br/>
<span id='50'>The confirmation of my promised gift,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Which but attends thy naming.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter three or four Lords</em></p>
<span id='52'>Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice</span><br/>
<span id='55'>I have to use: thy frank election make;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>I'ld give bay Curtal and his furniture,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>My mouth no more were broken than these boys',</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And writ as little beard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Peruse them well:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Not one of those but had a noble father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Gentlemen,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>We understand it, and thank heaven for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>That I protest I simply am a maid.</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Please it your majesty, I have done already:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>We'll ne'er come there again.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Make choice; and, see,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And to imperial Love, that god most high,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>And grant it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>                  Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace</span><br/>
<span id='82'>for my life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Before I speak, too threateningly replies:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Love make your fortunes twenty times above</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Her that so wishes and her humble love!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>No better, if you please.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>My wish receive,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>I'd have them whipped; or I would send them to the</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Turk, to make eunuchs of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Be not afraid that I your hand should take;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>I'll never do you wrong for your own sake:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>These boys are boys of ice, they'll none have her:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>sure, they are bastards to the English; the French</span><br/>
<span id='99'>ne'er got 'em.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>You are too young, too happy, and too good,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>To make yourself a son out of my blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>Fourth Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Fair one, I think not so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk</span><br/>
<span id='104'>wine: but if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth</span><br/>
<span id='105'>of fourteen; I have known thee already.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>[To BERTRAM]  I dare not say I take you; but I give</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Me and my service, ever whilst I live,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Into your guiding power. This is the man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>In such a business give me leave to use</span><br/>
<span id='112'>The help of mine own eyes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Know'st thou not, Bertram,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>What she has done for me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Yes, my good lord;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>But never hope to know why I should marry her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>But follows it, my lord, to bring me down</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Must answer for your raising? I know her well:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>She had her breeding at my father's charge.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Rather corrupt me ever!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which</span><br/>
<span id='124'>I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off</span><br/>
<span id='127'>In differences so mighty. If she be</span><br/>
<span id='128'>All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Of virtue for the name: but do not so:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>The place is dignified by the doer's deed:</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>It is a dropsied honour. Good alone</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Is good without a name. Vileness is so:</span><br/>
<span id='136'>The property by what it is should go,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;</span><br/>
<span id='138'>In these to nature she's immediate heir,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Which challenges itself as honour's born</span><br/>
<span id='141'>And is not like the sire: honours thrive,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>When rather from our acts we them derive</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave</span><br/>
<span id='145'>A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?</span><br/>
<span id='148'>If thou canst like this creature as a maid,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>I can create the rest: virtue and she</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Let the rest go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>That dost in vile misprision shackle up</span><br/>
<span id='159'>My love and her desert; that canst not dream,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>We, poising us in her defective scale,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>It is in us to plant thine honour where</span><br/>
<span id='163'>We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Obey our will, which travails in thy good:</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Believe not thy disdain, but presently</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Do thine own fortunes that obedient right</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Or I will throw thee from my care for ever</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Into the staggers and the careless lapse</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit</span><br/>
<span id='174'>My fancy to your eyes: when I consider</span><br/>
<span id='175'>What great creation and what dole of honour</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now</span><br/>
<span id='178'>The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Is as 'twere born so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Take her by the hand,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise</span><br/>
<span id='182'>A counterpoise, if not to thy estate</span><br/>
<span id='183'>A balance more replete.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>I take her hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>Good fortune and the favour of the king</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Shall more attend upon the coming space,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.</span><br/>

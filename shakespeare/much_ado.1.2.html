<blockquote>
<em>Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meeting</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son?</span><br/>
<span id='2'>hath he provided this music?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell</span><br/>
<span id='4'>you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Are they good?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>As the event stamps them: but they have a good</span><br/>
<span id='7'>cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine</span><br/>
<span id='9'>orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my</span><br/>
<span id='11'>niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it</span><br/>
<span id='12'>this night in a dance: and if he found her</span><br/>
<span id='13'>accordant, he meant to take the present time by the</span><br/>
<span id='14'>top and instantly break with you of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and</span><br/>
<span id='17'>question him yourself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear</span><br/>
<span id='19'>itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>that she may be the better prepared for an answer,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Attendants</em></p>
<span id='22'>Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you</span><br/>
<span id='23'>mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your</span><br/>
<span id='24'>skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

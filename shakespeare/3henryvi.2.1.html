<h1>Henry VI, Part 3</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Or whether he be 'scaped away or no</span><br/>
<span id='3'>From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard</span><br/>
<span id='7'>The happy tidings of his good escape.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>How fares my brother? why is he so sad?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>RICHARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>I cannot joy, until I be resolved</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Where our right valiant father is become.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>I saw him in the battle range about;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Methought he bore him in the thickest troop</span><br/>
<span id='14'>As doth a lion in a herd of neat;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>So fared our father with his enemies;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>So fled his enemies my warlike father:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>See how the morning opes her golden gates,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!</span><br/>
<span id='23'>How well resembles it the prime of youth,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>RICHARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Not separated with the racking clouds,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>As if they vow'd some league inviolable:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>In this the heaven figures some event.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>I think it cites us, brother, to the field,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Each one already blazing by our meeds,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Should notwithstanding join our lights together</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And over-shine the earth as this the world.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Upon my target three fair-shining suns.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>RICHARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>You love the breeder better than the male.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
<span id='43'>But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Ah, one that was a woful looker-on</span><br/>
<span id='46'>When as the noble Duke of York was slain,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Your princely father and my loving lord!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>RICHARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Say how he died, for I will hear it all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Environed he was with many foes,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And stood against them, as the hope of Troy</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>But Hercules himself must yield to odds;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And many strokes, though with a little axe,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>By many hands your father was subdued;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks</span><br/>
<span id='62'>A napkin steeped in the harmless blood</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And after many scorns, many foul taunts,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>They took his head, and on the gates of York</span><br/>
<span id='66'>They set the same; and there it doth remain,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain</span><br/>
<span id='71'>The flower of Europe for his chivalry;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Now my soul's palace is become a prison:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Might in the ground be closed up in rest!</span><br/>
<span id='77'>For never henceforth shall I joy again,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Never, O never shall I see more joy!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>RICHARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'> I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>For selfsame wind that I should speak withal</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>To weep is to make less the depth of grief:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Or die renowned by attempting it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>His dukedom and his chair with me is left.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>RICHARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.</span><br/>
<p><em>March. Enter WARWICK, MONTAGUE, and their army</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>RICHARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>The words would add more anguish than the wounds.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And now, to add more measure to your woes,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.</span><br/>
<span id='107'>After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Were brought me of your loss and his depart.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>I, then in London keeper of the king,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>And very well appointed, as I thought,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Bearing the king in my behalf along;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>For by my scouts I was advertised</span><br/>
<span id='117'>That she was coming with a full intent</span><br/>
<span id='118'>To dash our late decree in parliament</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Or whether 'twas report of her success;</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Who thunders to his captives blood and death,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Their weapons like to lightning came and went;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Or like an idle thresher with a flail,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.</span><br/>
<span id='133'>I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>With promise of high pay and great rewards:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And we in them no hope to win the day;</span><br/>
<span id='137'>So that we fled; the king unto the queen;</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:</span><br/>
<span id='140'>For in the marches here we heard you were,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Making another head to fight again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?</span><br/>
<span id='143'>And when came George from Burgundy to England?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And for your brother, he was lately sent</span><br/>
<span id='146'>From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>With aid of soldiers to this needful war.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>RICHARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Were he as famous and as bold in war</span><br/>
<span id='156'>As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>RICHARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:</span><br/>
<span id='158'>'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.</span><br/>
<span id='159'>But in this troublous time what's to be done?</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Or shall we on the helmets of our foes</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?</span><br/>
<span id='165'>If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>And therefore comes my brother Montague.</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>And of their feather many more proud birds,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.</span><br/>
<span id='172'>He swore consent to your succession,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>His oath enrolled in the parliament;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>And now to London all the crew are gone,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>To frustrate both his oath and what beside</span><br/>
<span id='176'>May make against the house of Lancaster.</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Why, Via! to London will we march amain,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>And once again bestride our foaming steeds,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'</span><br/>
<span id='185'>But never once again turn back and fly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>RICHARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;</span><br/>
<span id='190'>And when thou fail'st&mdash;as God forbid the hour!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:</span><br/>
<span id='193'>The next degree is England's royal throne;</span><br/>
<span id='194'>For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd</span><br/>
<span id='195'>In every borough as we pass along;</span><br/>
<span id='196'>And he that throws not up his cap for joy</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.</span><br/>
<span id='198'>King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>But sound the trumpets, and about our task.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>RICHARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>How now! what news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>The queen is coming with a puissant host;</span><br/>
<span id='208'>And craves your company for speedy counsel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='209'>Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

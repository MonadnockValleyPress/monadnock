<h1>Much Ado About Nothing</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The same.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DON JOHN and BORACHIO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the</span><br/>
<span id='2'>daughter of Leonato.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be</span><br/>
<span id='5'>medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges</span><br/>
<span id='7'>evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no</span><br/>
<span id='9'>dishonesty shall appear in me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Show me briefly how.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>I think I told your lordship a year since, how much</span><br/>
<span id='12'>I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting</span><br/>
<span id='13'>gentlewoman to Hero.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>I remember.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to</span><br/>
<span id='19'>the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that</span><br/>
<span id='20'>he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Claudio&mdash;whose estimation do you mightily hold</span><br/>
<span id='22'>up&mdash;to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>What proof shall I make of that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any</span><br/>
<span id='26'>other issue?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and</span><br/>
<span id='29'>the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know</span><br/>
<span id='30'>that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the</span><br/>
<span id='31'>prince and Claudio, as,&mdash;in love of your brother's</span><br/>
<span id='32'>honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's</span><br/>
<span id='33'>reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the</span><br/>
<span id='34'>semblance of a maid,&mdash;that you have discovered</span><br/>
<span id='35'>thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>offer them instances; which shall bear no less</span><br/>
<span id='37'>likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night</span><br/>
<span id='40'>before the intended wedding,&mdash;for in the meantime I</span><br/>
<span id='41'>will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be</span><br/>
<span id='42'>absent,&mdash;and there shall appear such seeming truth</span><br/>
<span id='43'>of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called</span><br/>
<span id='44'>assurance and all the preparation overthrown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put</span><br/>
<span id='46'>it in practise. Be cunning in the working this, and</span><br/>
<span id='47'>thy fee is a thousand ducats.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning</span><br/>
<span id='49'>shall not shame me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>I will presently go learn their day of marriage.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Or shall we on without a apology?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>The date is out of such prolixity:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke</span><br/>
<span id='8'>After the prompter, for our entrance:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>But let them measure us by what they will;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Being but heavy, I will bear the light.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes</span><br/>
<span id='15'>With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead</span><br/>
<span id='16'>So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And soar with them above a common bound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>I am too sore enpierced with his shaft</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Under love's heavy burden do I sink.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>And, to sink in it, should you burden love;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Too great oppression for a tender thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>If love be rough with you, be rough with love;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Give me a case to put my visage in:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>A visor for a visor! what care I</span><br/>
<span id='31'>What curious eye doth quote deformities?</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>But every man betake him to his legs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>A torch for me: let wantons light of heart</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Nay, that's not so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>I mean, sir, in delay</span><br/>
<span id='46'>We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Five times in that ere once in our five wits.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>And we mean well in going to this mask;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>But 'tis no wit to go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Why, may one ask?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>I dream'd a dream to-night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>And so did I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Well, what was yours?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>That dreamers often lie.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes</span><br/>
<span id='59'>In shape no bigger than an agate-stone</span><br/>
<span id='60'>On the fore-finger of an alderman,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Drawn with a team of little atomies</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>The traces of the smallest spider's web,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Not so big as a round little worm</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And in this state she gallops night by night</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Then dreams, he of another benefice:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab</span><br/>
<span id='93'>That plats the manes of horses in the night,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>That presses them and learns them first to bear,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Making them women of good carriage:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>This is she&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>                  Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Thou talk'st of nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MERCUTIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>True, I talk of dreams,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Which are the children of an idle brain,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Which is as thin of substance as the air</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Even now the frozen bosom of the north,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Supper is done, and we shall come too late.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>I fear, too early: for my mind misgives</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Some consequence yet hanging in the stars</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Shall bitterly begin his fearful date</span><br/>
<span id='115'>With this night's revels and expire the term</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Of a despised life closed in my breast</span><br/>
<span id='117'>By some vile forfeit of untimely death.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>But He, that hath the steerage of my course,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Strike, drum.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

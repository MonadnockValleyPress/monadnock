<span id='speech1'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Say that I linger'd with you at your shop</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To see the making of her carcanet,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And that to-morrow you will bring it home.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>But here's a villain that would face me down</span><br/>
<span id='7'>He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And that I did deny my wife and house.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>I think thou art an ass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Marry, so it doth appear</span><br/>
<span id='17'>By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer</span><br/>
<span id='21'>May answer my good will and your good welcome here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BALTHAZAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your</span><br/>
<span id='23'>welcome dear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BALTHAZAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BALTHAZAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>[Within]  Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>idiot, patch!</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st</span><br/>
<span id='38'>for such store,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>What patch is made our porter? My master stays in</span><br/>
<span id='41'>the street.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>[Within]  Let him walk from whence he came, lest he</span><br/>
<span id='43'>catch cold on's feet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Who talks within there? ho, open the door!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>[Within]  Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an you tell</span><br/>
<span id='46'>me wherefore.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>[Within]  Nor to-day here you must not; come again</span><br/>
<span id='49'>when you may.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>[Within]  The porter for this time, sir, and my name</span><br/>
<span id='52'>is Dromio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy</span><br/>
<span id='57'>name for an ass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LUCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>[Within]  What a coil is there, Dromio? who are those</span><br/>
<span id='59'>at the gate?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Let my master in, Luce.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LUCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>[Within]  Faith, no; he comes too late;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And so tell your master.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>O Lord, I must laugh!</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Have at you with a proverb&mdash;Shall I set in my staff?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LUCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>[Within]  Have at you with another; that's&mdash;When?</span><br/>
<span id='66'>can you tell?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>[Within]  If thy name be call'd Luce&mdash;Luce, thou hast</span><br/>
<span id='68'>answered him well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LUCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>[Within]  I thought to have asked you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>[Within]  And you said no.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Thou baggage, let me in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LUCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>[Within]  Can you tell for whose sake?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Master, knock the door hard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LUCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>[Within]  Let him knock till it ache.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LUCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>[Within]  What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>[Within]  Who is that at the door that keeps all</span><br/>
<span id='80'>this noise?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>[Within]  By my troth, your town is troubled with</span><br/>
<span id='82'>unruly boys.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Are you there, wife? you might have come before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>[Within]  Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would</span><br/>
<span id='87'>fain have either.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BALTHAZAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>[Within]  Break any breaking here, and I'll break your</span><br/>
<span id='96'>knave's pate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>[Within]  It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon</span><br/>
<span id='100'>thee, hind!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>let me in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>

<span id='103'>[Within]  Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?</span><br/>
<span id='106'>For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>BALTHAZAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Herein you war against your reputation</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And draw within the compass of suspect</span><br/>
<span id='112'>The unviolated honour of your wife.</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Once this,&mdash;your long experience of her wisdom,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Her sober virtue, years and modesty,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Why at this time the doors are made against you.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Be ruled by me: depart in patience,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>And about evening come yourself alone</span><br/>
<span id='121'>To know the reason of this strange restraint.</span><br/>
<span id='122'>If by strong hand you offer to break in</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Now in the stirring passage of the day,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>A vulgar comment will be made of it,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And that supposed by the common rout</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Against your yet ungalled estimation</span><br/>
<span id='127'>That may with foul intrusion enter in</span><br/>
<span id='128'>And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>For slander lives upon succession,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>For ever housed where it gets possession.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.</span><br/>
<span id='133'>I know a wench of excellent discourse,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>There will we dine. This woman that I mean,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>My wife&mdash;but, I protest, without desert&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>To her will we to dinner.</span><br/>
<p><em>To Angelo</em></p>

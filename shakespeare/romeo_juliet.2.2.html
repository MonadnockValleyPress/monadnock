<h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Capulet's orchard.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ROMEO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>He jests at scars that never felt a wound.</span><br/>
<p><em>JULIET appears above at a window</em></p>
<span id='2'>But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?</span><br/>
<span id='3'>It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Who is already sick and pale with grief,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>That thou her maid art far more fair than she:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Be not her maid, since she is envious;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Her vestal livery is but sick and green</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>It is my lady, O, it is my love!</span><br/>
<span id='11'>O, that she knew she were!</span><br/>
<span id='12'>She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Her eye discourses; I will answer it.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Having some business, do entreat her eyes</span><br/>
<span id='17'>To twinkle in their spheres till they return.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>What if her eyes were there, they in her head?</span><br/>
<span id='19'>The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Would through the airy region stream so bright</span><br/>
<span id='22'>That birds would sing and think it were not night.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!</span><br/>
<span id='24'>O, that I were a glove upon that hand,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>That I might touch that cheek!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Ay me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>She speaks:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art</span><br/>
<span id='29'>As glorious to this night, being o'er my head</span><br/>
<span id='30'>As is a winged messenger of heaven</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him</span><br/>
<span id='33'>When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And sails upon the bosom of the air.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Deny thy father and refuse thy name;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And I'll no longer be a Capulet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>[Aside]  Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.</span><br/>
<span id='42'>What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!</span><br/>
<span id='45'>What's in a name? that which we call a rose</span><br/>
<span id='46'>By any other name would smell as sweet;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Retain that dear perfection which he owes</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And for that name which is no part of thee</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Take all myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>                  I take thee at thy word:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Henceforth I never will be Romeo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night</span><br/>
<span id='56'>So stumblest on my counsel?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>By a name</span><br/>
<span id='58'>I know not how to tell thee who I am:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Because it is an enemy to thee;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Had I it written, I would tear the word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?</span><br/>
<span id='67'>The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And the place death, considering who thou art,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>If any of my kinsmen find thee here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>For stony limits cannot hold love out,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And what love can do that dares love attempt;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>If they do see thee, they will murder thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And I am proof against their enmity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>I would not for the world they saw thee here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And but thou love me, let them find me here:</span><br/>
<span id='81'>My life were better ended by their hate,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>By whose direction found'st thou out this place?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far</span><br/>
<span id='87'>As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>I would adventure for such merchandise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek</span><br/>
<span id='91'>For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny</span><br/>
<span id='93'>What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Than those that have more cunning to be strange.</span><br/>
<span id='106'>I should have been more strange, I must confess,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>But that thou overheard'st, ere I was 'ware,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And not impute this yielding to light love,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Which the dark night hath so discovered.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear</span><br/>
<span id='112'>That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>That monthly changes in her circled orb,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>What shall I swear by?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Do not swear at all;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Which is the god of my idolatry,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>And I'll believe thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>If my heart's dear love&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>I have no joy of this contract to-night:</span><br/>
<span id='124'>It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!</span><br/>
<span id='127'>This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Come to thy heart as that within my breast!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And yet I would it were to give again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>But to be frank, and give it thee again.</span><br/>
<span id='138'>And yet I wish but for the thing I have:</span><br/>
<span id='139'>My bounty is as boundless as the sea,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>My love as deep; the more I give to thee,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>The more I have, for both are infinite.</span><br/>
<p><em>Nurse calls within</em></p>
<span id='142'>I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Stay but a little, I will come again.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit, above</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Being in night, all this is but a dream,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter JULIET, above</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.</span><br/>
<span id='149'>If that thy bent of love be honourable,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>By one that I'll procure to come to thee,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;</span><br/>
<span id='153'>And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay</span><br/>
<span id='154'>And follow thee my lord throughout the world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>Nurse</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>[Within]  Madam!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>I come, anon.&mdash;But if thou mean'st not well,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>I do beseech thee&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>Nurse</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>[Within]  Madam!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>By and by, I come:&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>To-morrow will I send.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>So thrive my soul&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>A thousand times good night!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit, above</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.</span><br/>
<p><em>Retiring</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter JULIET, above</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>To lure this tassel-gentle back again!</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>With repetition of my Romeo's name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>It is my soul that calls upon my name:</span><br/>
<span id='174'>How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Like softest music to attending ears!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>Romeo!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>     My dear?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>                  At what o'clock to-morrow</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Shall I send to thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>At the hour of nine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.</span><br/>
<span id='182'>I have forgot why I did call thee back.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>Let me stand here till thou remember it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Remembering how I love thy company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Forgetting any other home but this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:</span><br/>
<span id='189'>And yet no further than a wanton's bird;</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Who lets it hop a little from her hand,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>And with a silk thread plucks it back again,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>So loving-jealous of his liberty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>I would I were thy bird.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>Sweet, so would I:</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Good night, good night! parting is such</span><br/>
<span id='198'>sweet sorrow,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>That I shall say good night till it be morrow.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit above</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

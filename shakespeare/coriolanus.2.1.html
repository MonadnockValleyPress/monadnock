<h1>Coriolanus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Rome. A public place.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people, SICINIUS and BRUTUS.</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Good or bad?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Not according to the prayer of the people, for they</span><br/>
<span id='4'>love not Marcius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Pray you, who does the wolf love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>The lamb.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the</span><br/>
<span id='9'>noble Marcius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two</span><br/>
<span id='12'>are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Both</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Well, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two</span><br/>
<span id='15'>have not in abundance?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Especially in pride.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>And topping all others in boasting.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>This is strange now: do you two know how you are</span><br/>
<span id='20'>censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the</span><br/>
<span id='21'>right-hand file? do you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Both</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Why, how are we censured?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Because you talk of pride now,&mdash;will you not be angry?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Both</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Well, well, sir, well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of</span><br/>
<span id='26'>occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at</span><br/>
<span id='28'>your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a</span><br/>
<span id='29'>pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for</span><br/>
<span id='30'>being proud?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>We do it not alone, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I know you can do very little alone; for your helps</span><br/>
<span id='33'>are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous</span><br/>
<span id='34'>single: your abilities are too infant-like for</span><br/>
<span id='35'>doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you</span><br/>
<span id='36'>could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>and make but an interior survey of your good selves!</span><br/>
<span id='38'>O that you could!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>What then, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as</span><br/>
<span id='42'>any in Rome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Menenius, you are known well enough too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that</span><br/>
<span id='45'>loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in</span><br/>
<span id='47'>favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like</span><br/>
<span id='48'>upon too trivial motion; one that converses more</span><br/>
<span id='49'>with the buttock of the night than with the forehead</span><br/>
<span id='50'>of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my</span><br/>
<span id='51'>malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as</span><br/>
<span id='52'>you are&mdash;I cannot call you Lycurguses&mdash;if the drink</span><br/>
<span id='53'>you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a</span><br/>
<span id='54'>crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have</span><br/>
<span id='55'>delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in</span><br/>
<span id='56'>compound with the major part of your syllables: and</span><br/>
<span id='57'>though I must be content to bear with those that say</span><br/>
<span id='58'>you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that</span><br/>
<span id='59'>tell you you have good faces. If you see this in</span><br/>
<span id='60'>the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known</span><br/>
<span id='61'>well enough too? what barm can your bisson</span><br/>
<span id='62'>conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be</span><br/>
<span id='63'>known well enough too?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You</span><br/>
<span id='66'>are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you</span><br/>
<span id='67'>wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a</span><br/>
<span id='68'>cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a</span><br/>
<span id='70'>second day of audience. When you are hearing a</span><br/>
<span id='71'>matter between party and party, if you chance to be</span><br/>
<span id='72'>pinched with the colic, you make faces like</span><br/>
<span id='73'>mummers; set up the bloody flag against all</span><br/>
<span id='74'>patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled</span><br/>
<span id='76'>by your hearing: all the peace you make in their</span><br/>
<span id='77'>cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are</span><br/>
<span id='78'>a pair of strange ones.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Come, come, you are well understood to be a</span><br/>
<span id='80'>perfecter giber for the table than a necessary</span><br/>
<span id='81'>bencher in the Capitol.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall</span><br/>
<span id='83'>encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When</span><br/>
<span id='84'>you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the</span><br/>
<span id='85'>wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not</span><br/>
<span id='86'>so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's</span><br/>
<span id='87'>cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-</span><br/>
<span id='88'>saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors</span><br/>
<span id='90'>since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the</span><br/>
<span id='91'>best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to</span><br/>
<span id='92'>your worships: more of your conversation would</span><br/>
<span id='93'>infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly</span><br/>
<span id='94'>plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.</span><br/>
<p><em>BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside</em></p>
<p><em>Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA</em></p>
<span id='95'>How now, my as fair as noble ladies,&mdash;and the moon,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>were she earthly, no nobler,&mdash;whither do you follow</span><br/>
<span id='97'>your eyes so fast?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for</span><br/>
<span id='99'>the love of Juno, let's go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Ha! Marcius coming home!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous</span><br/>
<span id='102'>approbation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Marcius coming home!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></span>

<span id='speech35'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Nay,'tis true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath</span><br/>
<span id='107'>another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one</span><br/>
<span id='108'>at home for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for</span><br/>
<span id='110'>me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven</span><br/>
<span id='113'>years' health; in which time I will make a lip at</span><br/>
<span id='114'>the physician: the most sovereign prescription in</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he</span><br/>
<span id='117'>not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>O, no, no, no.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'</span><br/>
<span id='121'>victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home</span><br/>
<span id='123'>with the oaken garland.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Aufidius got off.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:</span><br/>
<span id='128'>an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so</span><br/>
<span id='129'>fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold</span><br/>
<span id='130'>that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate</span><br/>
<span id='132'>has letters from the general, wherein he gives my</span><br/>
<span id='133'>son the whole name of the war: he hath in this</span><br/>
<span id='134'>action outdone his former deeds doubly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>VALERIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his</span><br/>
<span id='137'>true purchasing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>The gods grant them true!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>True! pow, wow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>True! I'll be sworn they are true.</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Where is he wounded?</span><br/>
<p><em>To the Tribunes</em></p>
<span id='142'>God save your good worships! Marcius is coming</span><br/>
<span id='143'>home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be</span><br/>
<span id='145'>large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall</span><br/>
<span id='146'>stand for his place. He received in the repulse of</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,&mdash;there's</span><br/>
<span id='149'>nine that I know.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five</span><br/>
<span id='151'>wounds upon him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.</span><br/>
<p><em>A shout and flourish</em></p>
<span id='153'>Hark! the trumpets.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he</span><br/>
<span id='155'>carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.</span><br/>
<p><em>A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the  general, and TITUS LARTIUS; between them, CORIOLANUS,  crowned with an oaken garland; with Captains and Soldiers, and a Herald</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>Herald</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight</span><br/>

<span id='219'>With variable complexions, all agreeing</span><br/>
<span id='220'>In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens</span><br/>

<span id='240'>With the least cause these his new honours, which</span><br/>
<span id='241'>That he will give them make I as little question</span><br/>
<span id='242'>As he is proud to do't.</span><br/>

<span id='speech82'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='243'>I heard him swear,</span><br/>
<span id='244'>Were he to stand for consul, never would he</span><br/>
<span id='245'>Appear i' the market-place nor on him put</span><br/>
<span id='246'>The napless vesture of humility;</span><br/>
<span id='247'>Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds</span><br/>
<span id='248'>To the people, beg their stinking breaths.</span><br/>

<span id='speech83'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>

<span id='249'>'Tis right.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='250'>It was his word: O, he would miss it rather</span><br/>
<span id='251'>Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,</span><br/>
<span id='252'>And the desire of the nobles.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='253'>I wish no better</span><br/>
<span id='254'>Than have him hold that purpose and to put it</span><br/>
<span id='255'>In execution.</span><br/>

<span id='speech86'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='256'>'Tis most like he will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='257'>It shall be to him then as our good wills,</span><br/>
<span id='258'>A sure destruction.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='259'>So it must fall out</span><br/>
<span id='260'>To him or our authorities. For an end,</span><br/>
<span id='261'>We must suggest the people in what hatred</span><br/>
<span id='262'>He still hath held them; that to's power he would</span><br/>
<span id='263'>Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and</span><br/>
<span id='264'>Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,</span><br/>
<span id='265'>In human action and capacity,</span><br/>
<span id='266'>Of no more soul nor fitness for the world</span><br/>
<span id='267'>Than camels in the war, who have their provand</span><br/>
<span id='268'>Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows</span><br/>
<span id='269'>For sinking under them.</span><br/>

<span id='273'>If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy</span><br/>
<span id='274'>As to set dogs on sheep&mdash;will be his fire</span><br/>
<span id='275'>To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze</span><br/>
<span id='276'>Shall darken him for ever.</span><br/>

<span id='speech91'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>

<span id='278'>You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought</span><br/>
<span id='279'>That Marcius shall be consul:</span><br/>
<span id='280'>I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and</span><br/>
<span id='281'>The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,</span><br/>
<span id='282'>Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,</span><br/>
<span id='283'>Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,</span><br/>
<span id='284'>As to Jove's statue, and the commons made</span><br/>
<span id='285'>A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:</span><br/>
<span id='286'>I never saw the like.</span><br/>

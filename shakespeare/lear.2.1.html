<h1>King Lear</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Gloucester's castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter EDMUND, and CURAN meets him</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Save thee, Curan.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CURAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>And you, sir. I have been with your father, and</span><br/>
<span id='3'>given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan</span><br/>
<span id='4'>his duchess will be here with him this night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>How comes that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CURAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but</span><br/>
<span id='8'>ear-kissing arguments?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Not I	pray you, what are they?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CURAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Not a word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CURAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>The duke be here to-night? The better! best!</span><br/>
<span id='15'>This weaves itself perforce into my business.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>My father hath set guard to take my brother;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And I have one thing, of a queasy question,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter EDGAR</em></p>
<span id='20'>My father watches: O sir, fly this place;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Intelligence is given where you are hid;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>You have now the good advantage of the night:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?</span><br/>
<span id='24'>He's coming hither: now, i' the night, i' the haste,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And Regan with him: have you nothing said</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Advise yourself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>                  I am sure on't, not a word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>I hear my father coming: pardon me:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>In cunning I must draw my sword upon you</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit EDGAR</em></p>
<span id='34'>Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.</span><br/>
<p><em>Wounds his arm</em></p>
<span id='35'>Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Do more than this in sport. Father, father!</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Stop, stop! No help?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GLOUCESTER, and Servants with torches</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Now, Edmund, where's the villain?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon</span><br/>
<span id='41'>To stand auspicious mistress,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>But where is he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Look, sir, I bleed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Where is the villain, Edmund?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Pursue him, ho! Go after.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt some Servants</em></p>
<span id='47'>By no means what?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>But that I told him, the revenging gods</span><br/>
<span id='50'>'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Seeing how loathly opposite I stood</span><br/>
<span id='54'>To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>With his prepared sword, he charges home</span><br/>
<span id='56'>My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Or whether gasted by the noise I made,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Full suddenly he fled.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Let him fly far:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And found&mdash;dispatch. The noble duke my master,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>By his authority I will proclaim it,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>He that conceals him, death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>When I dissuaded him from his intent,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And found him pight to do it, with curst speech</span><br/>
<span id='71'>I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>If I would stand against thee, would the reposal</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce</span><br/>
<span id='77'>My very character,&mdash;I'ld turn it all</span><br/>
<span id='78'>To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>And thou must make a dullard of the world,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>If they not thought the profits of my death</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Were very pregnant and potential spurs</span><br/>
<span id='82'>To make thee seek it.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Strong and fasten'd villain</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Would he deny his letter? I never got him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Tucket within</em></p>
<span id='85'>Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture</span><br/>
<span id='88'>I will send far and near, that all the kingdom</span><br/>
<span id='89'>May have the due note of him; and of my land,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means</span><br/>
<span id='91'>To make thee capable.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>If it be true, all vengeance comes too short</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>O, madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>What, did my father's godson seek your life?</span><br/>
<span id='98'>He whom my father named? your Edgar?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Was he not companion with the riotous knights</span><br/>
<span id='101'>That tend upon my father?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Yes, madam, he was of that consort.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>To have the expense and waste of his revenues.</span><br/>
<span id='107'>I have this present evening from my sister</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>That if they come to sojourn at my house,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>I'll not be there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Nor I, assure thee, Regan.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father</span><br/>
<span id='113'>A child-like office.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>'Twas my duty, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>He did bewray his practise; and received</span><br/>
<span id='116'>This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Is he pursued?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>                  Ay, my good lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>If he be taken, he shall never more</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant</span><br/>
<span id='123'>So much commend itself, you shall be ours:</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>You we first seize on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>I shall serve you, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Truly, however else.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>For him I thank your grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>You know not why we came to visit you,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Wherein we must have use of your advice:</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Of differences, which I least thought it fit</span><br/>
<span id='135'>To answer from our home; the several messengers</span><br/>
<span id='136'>From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Your needful counsel to our business,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Which craves the instant use.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>I serve you, madam:</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Your graces are right welcome.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

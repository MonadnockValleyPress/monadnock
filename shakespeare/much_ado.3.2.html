<h1>Much Ado About Nothing</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>A room in Leonato's house</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and LEONATO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and</span><br/>
<span id='2'>then go I toward Arragon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll</span><br/>
<span id='4'>vouchsafe me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss</span><br/>
<span id='6'>of your marriage as to show a child his new coat</span><br/>
<span id='7'>and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold</span><br/>
<span id='8'>with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown</span><br/>
<span id='9'>of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all</span><br/>
<span id='10'>mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's</span><br/>
<span id='11'>bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at</span><br/>
<span id='12'>him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his</span><br/>
<span id='13'>tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his</span><br/>
<span id='14'>tongue speaks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Gallants, I am not as I have been.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>So say I	methinks you are sadder.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>I hope he be in love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in</span><br/>
<span id='19'>him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>he wants money.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>I have the toothache.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Draw it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Hang it!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>What! sigh for the toothache?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Where is but a humour or a worm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Well, every one can master a grief but he that has</span><br/>
<span id='28'>it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Yet say I, he is in love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be</span><br/>
<span id='31'>a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be</span><br/>
<span id='32'>a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the</span><br/>
<span id='33'>shape of two countries at once, as, a German from</span><br/>
<span id='34'>the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from</span><br/>
<span id='35'>the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy</span><br/>
<span id='36'>to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no</span><br/>
<span id='37'>fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>If he be not in love with some woman, there is no</span><br/>
<span id='39'>believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'</span><br/>
<span id='40'>mornings; what should that bode?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Hath any man seen him at the barber's?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>and the old ornament of his cheek hath already</span><br/>
<span id='44'>stuffed tennis-balls.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him</span><br/>
<span id='47'>out by that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>The greatest note of it is his melancholy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>And when was he wont to wash his face?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear</span><br/>
<span id='52'>what they say of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into</span><br/>
<span id='54'>a lute-string and now governed by stops.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>conclude he is in love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Nay, but I know who loves him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of</span><br/>
<span id='60'>all, dies for him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>She shall be buried with her face upwards.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old</span><br/>
<span id='63'>signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight</span><br/>
<span id='64'>or nine wise words to speak to you, which these</span><br/>
<span id='65'>hobby-horses must not hear.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this</span><br/>
<span id='68'>played their parts with Beatrice; and then the two</span><br/>
<span id='69'>bears will not bite one another when they meet.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DON JOHN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>My lord and brother, God save you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Good den, brother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>If your leisure served, I would speak with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>In private?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; for</span><br/>
<span id='75'>what I would speak of concerns him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>What's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>[To CLAUDIO]  Means your lordship to be married</span><br/>
<span id='78'>to-morrow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>You know he does.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>I know not that, when he knows what I know.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>You may think I love you not: let that appear</span><br/>
<span id='83'>hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will</span><br/>
<span id='84'>manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you</span><br/>
<span id='85'>well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect</span><br/>
<span id='86'>your ensuing marriage;&mdash;surely suit ill spent and</span><br/>
<span id='87'>labour ill bestowed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Why, what's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances</span><br/>
<span id='90'>shortened, for she has been too long a talking of,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>the lady is disloyal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Who, Hero?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero:</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Disloyal?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I</span><br/>
<span id='96'>could say she were worse: think you of a worse</span><br/>
<span id='97'>title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till</span><br/>
<span id='98'>further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall</span><br/>
<span id='99'>see her chamber-window entered, even the night</span><br/>
<span id='100'>before her wedding-day: if you love her then,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour</span><br/>
<span id='102'>to change your mind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>May this be so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>I will not think it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>If you dare not trust that you see, confess not</span><br/>
<span id='106'>that you know: if you will follow me, I will show</span><br/>
<span id='107'>you enough; and when you have seen more and heard</span><br/>
<span id='108'>more, proceed accordingly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry</span><br/>
<span id='110'>her to-morrow in the congregation, where I should</span><br/>
<span id='111'>wed, there will I shame her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join</span><br/>
<span id='113'>with thee to disgrace her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>I will disparage her no farther till you are my</span><br/>
<span id='115'>witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, and</span><br/>
<span id='116'>let the issue show itself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>O day untowardly turned!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>O mischief strangely thwarting!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>O plague right well prevented! so will you say when</span><br/>
<span id='120'>you have seen the sequel.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Henry V</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene VI</h3>
<h4>The English camp in Picardy.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GOWER and FLUELLEN, meeting</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>How now, Captain Fluellen! come you from the bridge?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>I assure you, there is very excellent services</span><br/>
<span id='3'>committed at the bridge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Is the Duke of Exeter safe?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>and a man that I love and honour with my soul, and my</span><br/>
<span id='7'>heart, and my duty, and my life, and my living, and</span><br/>
<span id='8'>my uttermost power: he is not-God be praised and</span><br/>
<span id='9'>blessed!&mdash;any hurt in the world; but keeps the</span><br/>
<span id='10'>bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the</span><br/>
<span id='12'>pridge, I think in my very conscience he is as</span><br/>
<span id='13'>valiant a man as Mark Antony; and he is a man of no</span><br/>
<span id='14'>estimation in the world; but did see him do as</span><br/>
<span id='15'>gallant service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>What do you call him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>He is called Aunchient Pistol.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>I know him not.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PISTOL</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Here is the man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PISTOL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Captain, I thee beseech to do me favours:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Ay, I praise God; and I have merited some love at</span><br/>
<span id='23'>his hands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PISTOL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And of buxom valour, hath, by cruel fate,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>That goddess blind,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>That stands upon the rolling restless stone&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is</span><br/>
<span id='30'>painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to</span><br/>
<span id='31'>signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is</span><br/>
<span id='32'>painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which</span><br/>
<span id='33'>is the moral of it, that she is turning, and</span><br/>
<span id='34'>inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her</span><br/>
<span id='35'>foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>the poet makes a most excellent description of it:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Fortune is an excellent moral.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PISTOL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>A damned death!</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>But Exeter hath given the doom of death</span><br/>
<span id='45'>For pax of little price.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut</span><br/>
<span id='48'>With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PISTOL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Why then, rejoice therefore.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice</span><br/>
<span id='53'>at: for if, look you, he were my brother, I would</span><br/>
<span id='54'>desire the duke to use his good pleasure, and put</span><br/>
<span id='55'>him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PISTOL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>It is well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PISTOL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>The fig of Spain!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Very good.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal; I</span><br/>
<span id='61'>remember him now; a bawd, a cutpurse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I'll assure you, a' uttered as brave words at the</span><br/>
<span id='63'>bridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But it</span><br/>
<span id='64'>is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>I warrant you, when time is serve.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then</span><br/>
<span id='67'>goes to the wars, to grace himself at his return</span><br/>
<span id='68'>into London under the form of a soldier. And such</span><br/>
<span id='69'>fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>and they will learn you by rote where services were</span><br/>
<span id='71'>done; at such and such a sconce, at such a breach,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was</span><br/>
<span id='73'>shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what</span><br/>
<span id='76'>a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of</span><br/>
<span id='77'>the camp will do among foaming bottles and</span><br/>
<span id='78'>ale-washed wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But</span><br/>
<span id='79'>you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or</span><br/>
<span id='80'>else you may be marvellously mistook.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>I tell you what, Captain Gower; I do perceive he is</span><br/>
<span id='82'>not the man that he would gladly make show to the</span><br/>
<span id='83'>world he is: if I find a hole in his coat, I will</span><br/>
<span id='84'>tell him my mind.</span><br/>
<p><em>Drum heard</em></p>
<span id='85'>Hark you, the king is coming, and I must speak with</span><br/>
<span id='86'>him from the pridge.</span><br/>
<p><em>Drum and colours. Enter KING HENRY, GLOUCESTER, and Soldiers</em></p>
<span id='87'>God pless your majesty!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>How now, Fluellen! camest thou from the bridge?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Ay, so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter has</span><br/>
<span id='90'>very gallantly maintained the pridge: the French is</span><br/>
<span id='91'>gone off, look you; and there is gallant and most</span><br/>
<span id='92'>prave passages; marry, th' athversary was have</span><br/>
<span id='93'>possession of the pridge; but he is enforced to</span><br/>
<span id='94'>retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the</span><br/>
<span id='95'>pridge: I can tell your majesty, the duke is a</span><br/>
<span id='96'>prave man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>What men have you lost, Fluellen?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>The perdition of th' athversary hath been very</span><br/>
<span id='99'>great, reasonable great: marry, for my part, I</span><br/>
<span id='100'>think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that</span><br/>
<span id='101'>is like to be executed for robbing a church, one</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Bardolph, if your majesty know the man: his face is</span><br/>
<span id='103'>all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o'</span><br/>
<span id='104'>fire: and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like</span><br/>
<span id='105'>a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>but his nose is executed and his fire's out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>We would have all such offenders so cut off: and we</span><br/>
<span id='108'>give express charge, that in our marches through the</span><br/>
<span id='109'>country, there be nothing compelled from the</span><br/>
<span id='110'>villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the</span><br/>
<span id='111'>French upbraided or abused in disdainful language;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the</span><br/>
<span id='113'>gentler gamester is the soonest winner.</span><br/>
<p><em>Tucket. Enter MONTJOY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>MONTJOY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>You know me by my habit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Well then I know thee: what shall I know of thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>MONTJOY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>My master's mind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Unfold it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>MONTJOY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England:</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantage</span><br/>
<span id='120'>is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we</span><br/>
<span id='121'>could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we</span><br/>
<span id='122'>thought not good to bruise an injury till it were</span><br/>
<span id='123'>full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice</span><br/>
<span id='124'>is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see</span><br/>
<span id='125'>his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him</span><br/>
<span id='126'>therefore consider of his ransom; which must</span><br/>
<span id='127'>proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we</span><br/>
<span id='128'>have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in</span><br/>
<span id='129'>weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.</span><br/>
<span id='130'>For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the</span><br/>
<span id='131'>effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too</span><br/>
<span id='132'>faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own</span><br/>
<span id='133'>person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and</span><br/>
<span id='134'>worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and</span><br/>
<span id='135'>tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his</span><br/>
<span id='136'>followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So far</span><br/>
<span id='137'>my king and master; so much my office.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>What is thy name? I know thy quality.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>MONTJOY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Montjoy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.</span><br/>
<span id='141'>And tell thy king I do not seek him now;</span><br/>
<span id='142'>But could be willing to march on to Calais</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>My people are with sickness much enfeebled,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>My numbers lessened, and those few I have</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Almost no better than so many French;</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>I thought upon one pair of English legs</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>That I do brag thus! This your air of France</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent.</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;</span><br/>
<span id='155'>My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>My army but a weak and sickly guard;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Though France himself and such another neighbour</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Go bid thy master well advise himself:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>We shall your tawny ground with your red blood</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.</span><br/>
<span id='164'>The sum of all our answer is but this:</span><br/>
<span id='165'>We would not seek a battle, as we are;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:</span><br/>
<span id='167'>So tell your master.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>MONTJOY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>I shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>I hope they will not come upon us now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>We are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.</span><br/>
<span id='171'>March to the bridge; it now draws toward night:</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>And on to-morrow, bid them march away.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

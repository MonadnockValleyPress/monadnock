<h1>Henry VI, Part 3</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Plains near Teaksbury.</h4>

<blockquote><em>March. Enter QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, SOMERSET, OXFORD, and soldiers</em></blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,<br/>
<span id='2'>But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.<br/>
<span id='3'>What though the mast be now blown overboard,<br/>
<span id='4'>The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,<br/>
<span id='5'>And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?<br/>
<span id='6'>Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he<br/>
<span id='7'>Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad<br/>
<span id='8'>With tearful eyes add water to the sea<br/>
<span id='9'>And give more strength to that which hath too much,<br/>
Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,<br/>
<span id='11'>Which industry and courage might have saved?<br/>
Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!<br/>
<span id='13'>Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?<br/>
<span id='14'>And Montague our topmost; what of him?<br/>
<span id='15'>Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?<br/>
Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?<br/>
<span id='17'>And Somerset another goodly mast?<br/>
<span id='18'>The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?<br/>
And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I<br/>
<span id='20'>For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?<br/>
<span id='21'>We will not from the helm to sit and weep,<br/>
<span id='22'>But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,<br/>
<span id='23'>From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.<br/>
<span id='24'>As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.<br/>
<span id='25'>And what is Edward but ruthless sea?<br/>
<span id='26'>What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?<br/>
<span id='27'>And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?<br/>
<span id='28'>All these the enemies to our poor bark.<br/>
<span id='29'>Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!<br/>
<span id='30'>Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:<br/>
<span id='31'>Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,<br/>
<span id='32'>Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.<br/>
<span id='33'>This speak I, lords, to let you understand,<br/>
<span id='34'>If case some one of you would fly from us,<br/>
<span id='35'>That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers<br/>
<span id='36'>More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.<br/>
Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided<br/>
'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit<br/>
Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,<br/>
<span id='41'>Infuse his breast with magnanimity<br/>
<span id='42'>And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.<br/>
<span id='43'>I speak not this as doubting any here<br/>
<span id='44'>For did I but suspect a fearful man<br/>
<span id='45'>He should have leave to go away betimes,<br/>
<span id='46'>Lest in our need he might infect another<br/>
<span id='47'>And make him of like spirit to himself.<br/>
<span id='48'>If any such be here&mdash;as God forbid!&mdash;<br/>
<span id='49'>Let him depart before we need his help.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>OXFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Women and children of so high a courage,<br/>
<span id='51'>And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame.<br/>
<span id='52'>O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather<br/>
<span id='53'>Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live<br/>
<span id='54'>To bear his image and renew his glories!<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>And he that will not fight for such a hope.<br/>
<span id='56'>Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,<br/>
<span id='57'>If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.<br/>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><em>Enter a Messenger</em></blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand.<br/>
<span id='61'>Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>OXFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I thought no less: it is his policy<br/>
<span id='63'>To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>But he's deceived; we are in readiness.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>OXFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.<br/>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><em>Flourish and march. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and soldiers</em></blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,<br/>
Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,<br/>
<span id='69'>Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.<br/>
<span id='70'>I need not add more fuel to your fire,<br/>
<span id='71'>For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out<br/>
<span id='72'>Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say<br/>
<span id='74'>My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,<br/>
<span id='75'>Ye see, I drink the water of mine eyes.<br/>
Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,<br/>
<span id='77'>Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,<br/>
<span id='78'>His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,<br/>
<span id='79'>His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;<br/>
<span id='80'>And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.<br/>
<span id='81'>You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords,<br/>
<span id='82'>Be valiant and give signal to the fight.<br/>
</blockquote>

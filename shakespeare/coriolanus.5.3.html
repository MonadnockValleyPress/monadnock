<h1>Coriolanus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene III</H3>
<h4>The tent of Coriolanus.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CORIOLANUS, AUFIDIUS, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Set down our host. My partner in this action,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly</span><br/>
<span id='4'>I have borne this business.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Only their ends</span><br/>
<span id='6'>You have respected; stopp'd your ears against</span><br/>
<span id='7'>The general suit of Rome; never admitted</span><br/>
<span id='8'>A private whisper, no, not with such friends</span><br/>
<span id='9'>That thought them sure of you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>This last old man,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Loved me above the measure of a father;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Was to send him; for whose old love I have,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The first conditions, which they did refuse</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And cannot now accept; to grace him only</span><br/>
<span id='18'>That thought he could do more, a very little</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?</span><br/>
<p><em>Shout within</em></p>
<span id='22'>Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow</span><br/>
<span id='23'>In the same time 'tis made? I will not.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA, leading young MARCIUS, VALERIA, and Attendants</em></p>
<span id='24'>My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand</span><br/>
<span id='26'>The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!</span><br/>
<span id='27'>All bond and privilege of nature, break!</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>As if Olympus to a molehill should</span><br/>
<span id='33'>In supplication nod: and my young boy</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Hath an aspect of intercession, which</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>As if a man were author of himself</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And knew no other kin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>My lord and husband!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>The sorrow that delivers us thus changed</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Makes you think so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Like a dull actor now,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>I have forgot my part, and I am out,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Forgive my tyranny; but do not say</span><br/>
<span id='48'>For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss</span><br/>
<span id='51'>I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And the most noble mother of the world</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;</span><br/>
<p><em>Kneels</em></p>
<span id='55'>Of thy deep duty more impression show</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Than that of common sons.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>O, stand up blest!</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>I kneel before thee; and unproperly</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Show duty, as mistaken all this while</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Between the child and parent.</span><br/>
<p><em>Kneels</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>What is this?</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Your knees to me? to your corrected son?</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Murdering impossibility, to make</span><br/>
<span id='68'>What cannot be, slight work.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Thou art my warrior;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>The noble sister of Publicola,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle</span><br/>
<span id='73'>That's curdied by the frost from purest snow</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>This is a poor epitome of yours,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Which by the interpretation of full time</span><br/>
<span id='77'>May show like all yourself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>The god of soldiers,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>With the consent of supreme Jove, inform</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove</span><br/>
<span id='81'>To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And saving those that eye thee!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Your knee, sirrah.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>That's my brave boy!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Are suitors to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>I beseech you, peace:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>The thing I have forsworn to grant may never</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Be held by you denials. Do not bid me</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not</span><br/>
<span id='95'>To ally my rages and revenges with</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Your colder reasons.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>O, no more, no more!</span><br/>
<span id='98'>You have said you will not grant us any thing;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>For we have nothing else to ask, but that</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Which you deny already: yet we will ask;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>That, if you fail in our request, the blame</span><br/>
<span id='102'>May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And state of bodies would bewray what life</span><br/>
<span id='107'>We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself</span><br/>
<span id='108'>How more unfortunate than all living women</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Are we come hither: since that thy sight,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>which should</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance</span><br/>
<span id='112'>with comforts,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Making the mother, wife and child to see</span><br/>
<span id='115'>The son, the husband and the father tearing</span><br/>
<span id='116'>His country's bowels out. And to poor we</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort</span><br/>
<span id='119'>That all but we enjoy; for how can we,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Alas, how can we for our country pray.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose</span><br/>
<span id='123'>The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Our comfort in the country. We must find</span><br/>
<span id='125'>An evident calamity, though we had</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Our wish, which side should win: for either thou</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Must, as a foreign recreant, be led</span><br/>
<span id='128'>With manacles thorough our streets, or else</span><br/>
<span id='129'>triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And bear the palm for having bravely shed</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>I purpose not to wait on fortune till</span><br/>
<span id='133'>These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Rather to show a noble grace to both parts</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner</span><br/>
<span id='136'>March to assault thy country than to tread&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Trust to't, thou shalt not&mdash;on thy mother's womb,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>That brought thee to this world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Ay, and mine,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Living to time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Young MARCIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>A' shall not tread on me;</span><br/>
<span id='143'>I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Not of a woman's tenderness to be,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.</span><br/>
<span id='146'>I have sat too long.</span><br/>
<p><em>Rising</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Nay, go not from us thus.</span><br/>
<span id='148'>If it were so that our request did tend</span><br/>
<span id='149'>To save the Romans, thereby to destroy</span><br/>
<span id='150'>The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces</span><br/>
<span id='153'>May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>'This we received;' and each in either side</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest</span><br/>
<span id='156'>For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>But with his last attempt he wiped it out;</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Destroy'd his country, and his name remains</span><br/>
<span id='164'>To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>To imitate the graces of the gods;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt</span><br/>
<span id='169'>That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:</span><br/>
<span id='172'>He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Perhaps thy childishness will move him more</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world</span><br/>
<span id='175'>More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>And spurn me back: but if it be not so,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>That thou restrain'st from me the duty which</span><br/>
<span id='184'>To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.</span><br/>
<span id='186'>To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;</span><br/>
<span id='188'>This is the last: so we will home to Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:</span><br/>
<span id='190'>This boy, that cannot tell what he would have</span><br/>
<span id='191'>But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Does reason our petition with more strength</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:</span><br/>
<span id='194'>This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;</span><br/>
<span id='195'>His wife is in Corioli and his child</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:</span><br/>
<span id='197'>I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>And then I'll speak a little.</span><br/>
<p><em>He holds her by the hand, silent</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>O mother, mother!</span><br/>
<span id='200'>What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>The gods look down, and this unnatural scene</span><br/>
<span id='202'>They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!</span><br/>
<span id='203'>You have won a happy victory to Rome;</span><br/>
<span id='204'>But, for your son,&mdash;believe it, O, believe it,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Were you in my stead, would you have heard</span><br/>
<span id='210'>A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?</span><br/>

<span id='212'>I dare be sworn you were:</span><br/>
<span id='213'>And, sir, it is no little thing to make</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,</span><br/>

<span id='218'>[Aside]  I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and</span><br/>

<h1>Measure for Measure</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</H3>
<h4>Another room in the same.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Provost and a Servant</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight</span><br/>
<span id='2'>I'll tell him of you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Pray you, do.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Servant</em></p>
<span id='4'>I'll know</span><br/>
<span id='5'>His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>He hath but as offended in a dream!</span><br/>
<span id='7'>All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he</span><br/>
<span id='8'>To die for't!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ANGELO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>                  Now, what's the matter. Provost?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Why dost thou ask again?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Lest I might be too rash:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Under your good correction, I have seen,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>When, after execution, judgment hath</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Repented o'er his doom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Go to; let that be mine:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Do you your office, or give up your place,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And you shall well be spared.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>I crave your honour's pardon.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?</span><br/>
<span id='22'>She's very near her hour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Dispose of her</span><br/>
<span id='24'>To some more fitter place, and that with speed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Servant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Here is the sister of the man condemn'd</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Desires access to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Hath he a sister?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And to be shortly of a sisterhood,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>If not already.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>                  Well, let her be admitted.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Servant</em></p>
<span id='32'>See you the fornicatress be removed:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Let have needful, but not lavish, means;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>There shall be order for't.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ISABELLA and LUCIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>God save your honour!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Stay a little while.</span><br/>
<p><em>To ISABELLA</em></p>
<span id='37'>You're welcome: what's your will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>I am a woeful suitor to your honour,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Please but your honour hear me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Well; what's your suit?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>There is a vice that most I do abhor,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And most desire should meet the blow of justice;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>For which I would not plead, but that I must;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>For which I must not plead, but that I am</span><br/>
<span id='45'>At war 'twixt will and will not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Well; the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>I have a brother is condemn'd to die:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>I do beseech you, let it be his fault,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And not my brother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>[Aside]  Heaven give thee moving graces!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Mine were the very cipher of a function,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And let go by the actor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>O just but severe law!</span><br/>
<span id='57'>I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>[Aside to ISABELLA]  Give't not o'er so: to him</span><br/>
<span id='59'>again, entreat him;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>You are too cold; if you should need a pin,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>To him, I say!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Must he needs die?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>                  Maiden, no remedy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>I will not do't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>                  But can you, if you would?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse</span><br/>
<span id='73'>A s mine is to him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>                  He's sentenced; 'tis too late.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>[Aside to ISABELLA]  You are too cold.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>May call it back again. Well, believe this,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Become them with one half so good a grace</span><br/>
<span id='82'>As mercy does.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>If he had been as you and you as he,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Would not have been so stern.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Pray you, be gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>I would to heaven I had your potency,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?</span><br/>
<span id='89'>No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And what a prisoner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>[Aside to ISABELLA]</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Ay, touch him; there's the vein.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Your brother is a forfeit of the law,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And you but waste your words.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Alas, alas!</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And He that might the vantage best have took</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Found out the remedy. How would you be,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>If He, which is the top of judgment, should</span><br/>
<span id='100'>But judge you as you are? O, think on that;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And mercy then will breathe within your lips,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Like man new made.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>                  Be you content, fair maid;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>It is the law, not I condemn your brother:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!</span><br/>
<span id='108'>He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens</span><br/>
<span id='109'>We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven</span><br/>
<span id='110'>With less respect than we do minister</span><br/>
<span id='111'>To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Who is it that hath died for this offence?</span><br/>
<span id='113'>There's many have committed it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>[Aside to ISABELLA]           Ay, well said.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Those many had not dared to do that evil,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>If the first that did the edict infringe</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Are now to have no successive degrees,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>But, ere they live, to end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Yet show some pity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>I show it most of all when I show justice;</span><br/>
<span id='127'>For then I pity those I do not know,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>So you must be the first that gives this sentence,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent</span><br/>
<span id='134'>To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous</span><br/>
<span id='135'>To use it like a giant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>[Aside to ISABELLA]   That's well said.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Could great men thunder</span><br/>
<span id='138'>As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>For every pelting, petty officer</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Would use his heaven for thunder;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Drest in a little brief authority,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Most ignorant of what he's most assured,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>His glassy essence, like an angry ape,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven</span><br/>
<span id='149'>As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Would all themselves laugh mortal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>[Aside to ISABELLA]  O, to him, to him, wench! he</span><br/>
<span id='152'>will relent;</span><br/>
<span id='153'>He's coming; I perceive 't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>[Aside]  Pray heaven she win him!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>But in the less foul profanation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>That in the captain's but a choleric word,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>[Aside to ISABELLA]  Art avised o' that? more on 't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Why do you put these sayings upon me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Because authority, though it err like others,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know</span><br/>
<span id='167'>That's like my brother's fault: if it confess</span><br/>
<span id='168'>A natural guiltiness such as is his,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Against my brother's life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>[Aside]                  She speaks, and 'tis</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Such sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>Gentle my lord, turn back.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>How! bribe me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>[Aside to ISABELLA]  You had marr'd all else.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor</span><br/>
<span id='181'>As fancy values them; but with true prayers</span><br/>
<span id='182'>That shall be up at heaven and enter there</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate</span><br/>
<span id='185'>To nothing temporal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>Well; come to me to-morrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>[Aside to ISABELLA]  Go to; 'tis well; away!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Heaven keep your honour safe!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>[Aside]	Amen:</span><br/>
<span id='190'>For I am that way going to temptation,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Where prayers cross.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>At what hour to-morrow</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Shall I attend your lordship?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>At any time 'fore noon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>'Save your honour!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ISABELLA, LUCIO, and Provost</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>                  From thee, even from thy virtue!</span><br/>
<span id='197'>What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?</span><br/>
<span id='198'>The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Ha!</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I</span><br/>
<span id='201'>That, lying by the violet in the sun,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be</span><br/>
<span id='204'>That modesty may more betray our sense</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary</span><br/>
<span id='207'>And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!</span><br/>
<span id='208'>What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Dost thou desire her foully for those things</span><br/>
<span id='210'>That make her good? O, let her brother live!</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Thieves for their robbery have authority</span><br/>
<span id='212'>When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>That I desire to hear her speak again,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?</span><br/>
<span id='215'>O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous</span><br/>
<span id='217'>Is that temptation that doth goad us on</span><br/>
<span id='218'>To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>With all her double vigour, art and nature,</span><br/>
<span id='220'>Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid</span><br/>
<span id='221'>Subdues me quite. Even till now,</span><br/>
<span id='222'>When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.</span><br/>

<h1>Richard III</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Before the palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter QUEEN MARGARET</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>So, now prosperity begins to mellow</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And drop into the rotten mouth of death.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To watch the waning of mine adversaries.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>A dire induction am I witness to,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And will to France, hoping the consequence</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!</span><br/>
<span id='10'>My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!</span><br/>
<span id='11'>If yet your gentle souls fly in the air</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Hover about me with your airy wings</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And hear your mother's lamentation!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Hover about her; say, that right for right</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>So many miseries have crazed my voice,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?</span><br/>
<span id='24'>When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Brief abstract and record of tedious days,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,</span><br/>
<p><em>Sitting down</em></p>
<span id='30'>Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave</span><br/>
<span id='32'>As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?</span><br/>
<p><em>Sitting down by her</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>If ancient sorrow be most reverend,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Give mine the benefit of seniory,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And let my woes frown on the upper hand.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>If sorrow can admit society,</span><br/>
<p><em>Sitting down with them</em></p>
<span id='39'>Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept</span><br/>
<span id='48'>A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>That foul defacer of God's handiwork,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>O upright, just, and true-disposing God,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Preys on the issue of his mother's body,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!</span><br/>
<span id='60'>God witness with me, I have wept for thine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And now I cloy me with beholding it.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Young York he is but boot, because both they</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Match not the high perfection of my loss:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And the beholders of this tragic play,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Only reserved their factor, to buy souls</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>To have him suddenly convey'd away.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>That I may live to say, The dog is dead!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>O, thou didst prophesy the time would come</span><br/>
<span id='80'>That I should wish for thee to help me curse</span><br/>
<span id='81'>That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>The presentation of but what I was;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>The flattering index of a direful pageant;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>A sign of dignity, a garish flag,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>To be the aim of every dangerous shot,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Decline all this, and see what now thou art:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>For happy wife, a most distressed widow;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>For joyful mother, one that wails the name;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>For one commanding all, obey'd of none.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And left thee but a very prey to time;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Having no more but thought of what thou wert,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>To torture thee the more, being what thou art.</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>From which even here I slip my weary neck,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>And leave the burthen of it all on thee.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:</span><br/>
<span id='115'>These English woes will make me smile in France.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And teach me how to curse mine enemies!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Compare dead happiness with living woe;</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>And he that slew them fouler than he is:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Why should calamity be full of words?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Windy attorneys to their client woes,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Airy succeeders of intestate joys,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Poor breathing orators of miseries!</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Let them have scope: though what they do impart</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And in the breath of bitter words let's smother</span><br/>
<span id='134'>My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.</span><br/>
<span id='135'>I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter KING RICHARD III, marching, with drums and trumpets</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Who intercepts my expedition?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>O, she that might have intercepted thee,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>By strangling thee in her accursed womb</span><br/>
<span id='139'>From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Where should be graven, if that right were right,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?</span><br/>
<span id='146'>And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish. Alarums</em></p>
<span id='151'>Either be patient, and entreat me fair,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Or with the clamorous report of war</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Thus will I drown your exclamations.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Art thou my son?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Then patiently hear my impatience.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Madam, I have a touch of your condition,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>O, let me speak!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>                  Do then: but I'll not hear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>I will be mild and gentle in my speech.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>And came I not at last to comfort you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.</span><br/>
<span id='168'>A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>treacherous,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:</span><br/>
<span id='175'>What comfortable hour canst thou name,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>That ever graced me in thy company?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd</span><br/>
<span id='178'>your grace</span><br/>
<span id='179'>To breakfast once forth of my company.</span><br/>
<span id='180'>If I be so disgracious in your sight,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Let me march on, and not offend your grace.</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Strike the drum.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>                  I prithee, hear me speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>You speak too bitterly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>Hear me a word;</span><br/>
<span id='186'>For I shall never speak to thee again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>So.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish</span><br/>
<span id='191'>And never look upon thy face again.</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!</span><br/>
<span id='195'>My prayers on the adverse party fight;</span><br/>
<span id='196'>And there the little souls of Edward's children</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Whisper the spirits of thine enemies</span><br/>
<span id='198'>And promise them success and victory.</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Abides in me; I say amen to all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>I have no more sons of the royal blood</span><br/>
<span id='205'>For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;</span><br/>
<span id='207'>And therefore level not to hit their lives.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>And must she die for this? O, let her live,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;</span><br/>
<span id='213'>Throw over her the veil of infamy:</span><br/>
<span id='214'>So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>To save her life, I'll say she is not so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>Her life is only safest in her birth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='219'>And only in that safety died her brothers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>

<span id='220'>Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>

<span id='222'>All unavoided is the doom of destiny.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='223'>True, when avoided grace makes destiny:</span><br/>
<span id='224'>My babes were destined to a fairer death,</span><br/>
<span id='225'>If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='226'>You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='227'>Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.</span><br/>
<span id='229'>Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,</span><br/>
<span id='230'>Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:</span><br/>
<span id='231'>No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt</span><br/>
<span id='232'>Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,</span><br/>
<span id='233'>To revel in the entrails of my lambs.</span><br/>
<span id='234'>But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys</span><br/>
<span id='236'>Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;</span><br/>
<span id='237'>And I, in such a desperate bay of death,</span><br/>
<span id='238'>Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,</span><br/>
<span id='239'>Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='240'>Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise</span><br/>
<span id='241'>And dangerous success of bloody wars,</span><br/>
<span id='242'>As I intend more good to you and yours,</span><br/>
<span id='243'>Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='244'>What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='245'>To be discover'd, that can do me good?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='246'>The advancement of your children, gentle lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='247'>Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='248'>No, to the dignity and height of honour</span><br/>
<span id='249'>The high imperial type of this earth's glory.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='250'>Flatter my sorrows with report of it;</span><br/>
<span id='251'>Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,</span><br/>
<span id='252'>Canst thou demise to any child of mine?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='253'>Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,</span><br/>
<span id='254'>Will I withal endow a child of thine;</span><br/>

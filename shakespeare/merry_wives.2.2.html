<span id='speech1'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I will not lend thee a penny.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Why, then the world's mine oyster.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Which I with sword will open.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should</span><br/>
<span id='5'>lay my countenance to pawn; I have grated upon my</span><br/>
<span id='6'>good friends for three reprieves for you and your</span><br/>
<span id='7'>coach-fellow Nym; or else you had looked through</span><br/>
<span id='8'>the grate, like a geminy of baboons. I am damned in</span><br/>
<span id='9'>hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends, you were</span><br/>
<span id='10'>good soldiers and tall fellows; and when Mistress</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took't upon</span><br/>
<span id='12'>mine honour thou hadst it not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll</span><br/>
<span id='15'>endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more</span><br/>
<span id='16'>about me, I am no gibbet for you. Go. A short knife</span><br/>
<span id='17'>and a throng! To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>You'll not bear a letter for me, you rogue! you</span><br/>
<span id='19'>stand upon your honour! Why, thou unconfinable</span><br/>
<span id='20'>baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the</span><br/>
<span id='21'>terms of my honour precise: I, I, I myself</span><br/>
<span id='22'>sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand</span><br/>
<span id='23'>and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to</span><br/>
<span id='24'>shuffle, to hedge and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain</span><br/>
<span id='26'>looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your</span><br/>
<span id='27'>bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your</span><br/>
<span id='28'>honour! You will not do it, you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>I do relent: what would thou more of man?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ROBIN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ROBIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Let her approach.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Give your worship good morrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Good morrow, good wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Not so, an't please your worship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Good maid, then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>I'll be sworn,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>As my mother was, the first hour I was born.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>I do believe the swearer. What with me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Two thousand, fair woman: and I'll vouchsafe thee</span><br/>
<span id='41'>the hearing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>There is one Mistress Ford, sir:&mdash;I pray, come a</span><br/>
<span id='43'>little nearer this ways:&mdash;I myself dwell with master</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Doctor Caius,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Your worship says very true: I pray your worship,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>come a little nearer this ways.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>I warrant thee, nobody hears; mine own people, mine</span><br/>
<span id='49'>own people.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Are they so? God bless them and make them his servants!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Well, Mistress Ford; what of her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Why, sir, she's a good creature. Lord Lord! your</span><br/>
<span id='53'>worship's a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you and all</span><br/>
<span id='54'>of us, I pray!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Marry, this is the short and the long of it; you</span><br/>
<span id='57'>have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis</span><br/>
<span id='58'>wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the</span><br/>
<span id='59'>court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her</span><br/>
<span id='60'>to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and</span><br/>
<span id='61'>lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant</span><br/>
<span id='62'>you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift</span><br/>
<span id='63'>after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so</span><br/>
<span id='64'>rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in</span><br/>
<span id='65'>such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of</span><br/>
<span id='66'>the best and the fairest, that would have won any</span><br/>
<span id='67'>woman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could never</span><br/>
<span id='68'>get an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels</span><br/>
<span id='69'>given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in</span><br/>
<span id='70'>any such sort, as they say, but in the way of</span><br/>
<span id='71'>honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get</span><br/>
<span id='72'>her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of</span><br/>
<span id='73'>them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which</span><br/>
<span id='74'>is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>But what says she to me? be brief, my good</span><br/>
<span id='76'>she-Mercury.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which</span><br/>
<span id='78'>she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you</span><br/>
<span id='79'>to notify that her husband will be absence from his</span><br/>
<span id='80'>house between ten and eleven.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Ten and eleven?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the</span><br/>
<span id='83'>picture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>her husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweet</span><br/>
<span id='85'>woman leads an ill life with him: he's a very</span><br/>
<span id='86'>jealousy man: she leads a very frampold life with</span><br/>
<span id='87'>him, good heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will</span><br/>
<span id='89'>not fail her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to</span><br/>
<span id='91'>your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty</span><br/>
<span id='92'>commendations to you too: and let me tell you in</span><br/>
<span id='93'>your ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, and</span><br/>
<span id='94'>one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor</span><br/>
<span id='95'>evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be the</span><br/>
<span id='96'>other: and she bade me tell your worship that her</span><br/>
<span id='97'>husband is seldom from home; but she hopes there</span><br/>
<span id='98'>will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon</span><br/>
<span id='99'>a man: surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Not I, I assure thee: setting the attractions of my</span><br/>
<span id='101'>good parts aside I have no other charms.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Blessing on your heart for't!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>That were a jest indeed! they have not so little</span><br/>
<span id='106'>grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Mistress Page would desire you to send her your</span><br/>
<span id='108'>little page, of all loves: her husband has a</span><br/>
<span id='109'>marvellous infection to the little page; and truly</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what</span><br/>
<span id='112'>she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go</span><br/>
<span id='113'>to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as</span><br/>
<span id='114'>she will: and truly she deserves it; for if there</span><br/>
<span id='115'>be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must</span><br/>
<span id='116'>send her your page; no remedy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Why, I will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come and</span><br/>
<span id='119'>go between you both; and in any case have a</span><br/>
<span id='120'>nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and</span><br/>
<span id='121'>the boy never need to understand any thing; for</span><br/>
<span id='122'>'tis not good that children should know any</span><br/>
<span id='123'>wickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>as they say, and know the world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Fare thee well: commend me to them both: there's</span><br/>
<span id='126'>my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with</span><br/>
<span id='127'>this woman.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt MISTRESS QUICKLY and ROBIN</em></p>
<span id='128'>This news distracts me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>This punk is one of Cupid's carriers:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Give fire: she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Sayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll make</span><br/>
<span id='133'>more of thy old body than I have done. Will they</span><br/>
<span id='134'>yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense</span><br/>
<span id='135'>of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, I</span><br/>
<span id='136'>thank thee. Let them say 'tis grossly done; so it be</span><br/>
<span id='137'>fairly done, no matter.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BARDOLPH</em></p>

<span id='138'>Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would fain</span><br/>

<span id='153'>Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.</span><br/>

<span id='speech51'><strong>FORD</strong></span>

<span id='154'>Good Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you;</span><br/>
<span id='155'>for I must let you understand I think myself in</span><br/>
<span id='156'>better plight for a lender than you are: the which</span><br/>
<span id='157'>hath something embolden'd me to this unseasoned</span><br/>
<span id='158'>intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all</span><br/>
<span id='159'>ways do lie open.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.</span><br/>

<span id='161'>Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me:</span><br/>
<span id='162'>if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or</span><br/>
<span id='163'>half, for easing me of the carriage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>

<span id='166'>Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to be</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Sir, I hear you are a scholar,&mdash;I will be brief</span><br/>
<span id='169'>with you,&mdash;and you have been a man long known to me,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>though I had never so good means, as desire, to make</span><br/>
<span id='171'>myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a</span><br/>
<span id='172'>thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine</span><br/>
<span id='173'>own imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have</span><br/>
<span id='174'>one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>turn another into the register of your own; that I</span><br/>
<span id='176'>may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you</span><br/>
<span id='177'>yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.</span><br/>

<span id='181'>Well, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>FORD</strong></span>

<span id='182'>I have long loved her, and, I protest to you,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting</span><br/>
<span id='184'>observance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;</span><br/>
<span id='185'>fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly</span><br/>
<span id='186'>give me sight of her; not only bought many presents</span><br/>
<span id='187'>to give her, but have given largely to many to know</span><br/>
<span id='188'>what she would have given; briefly, I have pursued</span><br/>
<span id='189'>her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the</span><br/>
<span id='190'>wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have</span><br/>
<span id='191'>merited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>I am sure, I have received none; unless experience</span><br/>
<span id='193'>be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite</span><br/>
<span id='194'>rate, and that hath taught me to say this:</span><br/>
<span id='195'>'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>

<span id='200'>Never.</span><br/>

<span id='201'>Of what quality was your love, then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>FORD</strong></span>

<span id='202'>Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so</span><br/>

<span id='210'>John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a</span><br/>
<span id='211'>gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable</span><br/>
<span id='212'>discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your</span><br/>
<span id='213'>place and person, generally allowed for your many</span><br/>
<span id='214'>war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='215'>O, sir!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend</span><br/>
<span id='217'>it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only</span><br/>
<span id='218'>give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as</span><br/>
<span id='219'>to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this</span><br/>
<span id='220'>Ford's wife: use your art of wooing; win her to</span><br/>
<span id='221'>consent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as</span><br/>
<span id='222'>any.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='223'>Would it apply well to the vehemency of your</span><br/>

<span id='225'>Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='226'>O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on</span><br/>
<span id='227'>the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my</span><br/>
<span id='228'>soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to</span><br/>
<span id='229'>be looked against. Now, could I could come to her</span><br/>
<span id='230'>with any detection in my hand, my desires had</span><br/>
<span id='231'>instance and argument to commend themselves: I</span><br/>
<span id='232'>could drive her then from the ward of her purity,</span><br/>
<span id='233'>her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand</span><br/>
<span id='234'>other her defences, which now are too too strongly</span><br/>
<span id='235'>embattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='236'>Master Brook, I will first make bold with your</span><br/>
<span id='237'>money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a</span><br/>
<span id='238'>gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.</span><br/>

<span id='269'>What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is</span><br/>

<span id='272'>hour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man</span><br/>
<span id='273'>have thought this? See the hell of having a false</span><br/>
<span id='274'>woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers</span><br/>
<span id='275'>ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not</span><br/>
<span id='276'>only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under</span><br/>
<span id='277'>the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that</span><br/>
<span id='278'>does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds</span><br/>
<span id='279'>well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are</span><br/>

<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>London. The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Flourish of trumpets: then hautboys. Enter KING  HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, SALISBURY, WARWICK, and  CARDINAL, on the one side; QUEEN MARGARET, SUFFOLK, YORK, SOMERSET, and BUCKINGHAM, on the other</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>As by your high imperial majesty</span><br/>
<span id='2'>I had in charge at my depart for France,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>As procurator to your excellence,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To marry Princess Margaret for your grace,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne and Alencon,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Seven earls, twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>I have perform'd my task and was espoused:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And humbly now upon my bended knee,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>In sight of England and her lordly peers,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Deliver up my title in the queen</span><br/>
<span id='13'>To your most gracious hands, that are the substance</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Of that great shadow I did represent;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The fairest queen that ever king received.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I can express no kinder sign of love</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Than this kind kiss. O Lord, that lends me life,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!</span><br/>
<span id='21'>For thou hast given me in this beauteous face</span><br/>
<span id='22'>A world of earthly blessings to my soul,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Great King of England and my gracious lord,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The mutual conference that my mind hath had,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>In courtly company or at my beads,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>With you, mine alder-liefest sovereign,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Makes me the bolder to salute my king</span><br/>
<span id='30'>With ruder terms, such as my wit affords</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And over-joy of heart doth minister.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Her sight did ravish; but her grace in speech,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Such is the fulness of my heart's content.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ALL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>[Kneeling]  Long live Queen Margaret, England's</span><br/>
<span id='38'>happiness!</span><br/>

<span id='speech6'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>

<span id='39'>We thank you all.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>My lord protector, so it please your grace,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Here are the articles of contracted peace</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Between our sovereign and the French king Charles,</span><br/>

<span id='47'>the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>daughter unto Reignier King of Naples, Sicilia and</span><br/>

<p><em>Lets the paper fall</em></p>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Uncle, how now!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>       Pardon me, gracious lord;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And dimm'd mine eyes, that I can read no further.</span><br/>

<span id='75'>Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Your grief, the common grief of all the land.</span><br/>
<span id='78'>What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>His valour, coin and people, in the wars?</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Did he so often lodge in open field,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>To conquer France, his true inheritance?</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To keep by policy what Henry got?</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Received deep scars in France and Normandy?</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>With all the learned council of the realm,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Studied so long, sat in the council-house</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Early and late, debating to and fro</span><br/>
<span id='92'>How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And had his highness in his infancy</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?</span><br/>

<span id='96'>Shall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance,</span><br/>

<span id='110'>Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Now, by the death of Him that died for all,</span><br/>

<span id='119'>Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer:</span><br/>
<span id='121'>And are the cities, that I got with wounds,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Delivered up again with peaceful words?</span><br/>

<span id='speech19'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>That dims the honour of this warlike isle!</span><br/>
<span id='126'>France should have torn and rent my very heart,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Before I would have yielded to this league.</span><br/>
<span id='128'>I never read but England's kings have had</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And our King Henry gives away his own,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>To match with her that brings no vantages.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>A proper jest, and never heard before,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth</span><br/>
<span id='134'>For costs and charges in transporting her!</span><br/>
<span id='135'>She should have stayed in France and starved</span><br/>
<span id='136'>in France, Before&mdash;</span><br/>

<span id='137'>My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:</span><br/>

<span id='139'>My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind;</span><br/>
<span id='140'>'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face</span><br/>
<span id='143'>I see thy fury: if I longer stay,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>We shall begin our ancient bickerings.</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>I prophesied France will be lost ere long.</span><br/>

<span id='147'>So, there goes our protector in a rage.</span><br/>
<span id='148'>'Tis known to you he is mine enemy,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>And no great friend, I fear me, to the king.</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>And heir apparent to the English crown:</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>There's reason he should be displeased at it.</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing words</span><br/>

<span id='173'>Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride</span><br/>
<span id='174'>And greatness of his place be grief to us,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal:</span><br/>
<span id='176'>His insolence is more intolerable</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Than all the princes in the land beside:</span><br/>
<span id='178'>If Gloucester be displaced, he'll be protector.</span><br/>

<span id='183'>Behoves it us to labour for the realm.</span><br/>
<span id='184'>I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Did bear him like a noble gentleman.</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>More like a soldier than a man o' the church,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>As stout and proud as he were lord of all,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Swear like a ruffian and demean himself</span><br/>

<span id='191'>Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,</span><br/>

<span id='216'>Paris is lost; the state of Normandy</span><br/>
<span id='217'>Stands on a tickle point, now they are gone:</span><br/>
<span id='218'>Suffolk concluded on the articles,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased</span><br/>
<span id='220'>To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.</span><br/>
<span id='221'>I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?</span><br/>
<span id='222'>'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.</span><br/>
<span id='223'>Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage</span><br/>
<span id='224'>And purchase friends and give to courtezans,</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Still revelling like lords till all be gone;</span><br/>
<span id='226'>While as the silly owner of the goods</span><br/>
<span id='227'>Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands</span><br/>

<span id='229'>While all is shared and all is borne away,</span><br/>

<span id='231'>So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,</span><br/>

<span id='236'>Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.</span><br/>
<span id='237'>Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!</span><br/>
<span id='238'>Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,</span><br/>
<span id='239'>Even as I have of fertile England's soil.</span><br/>
<span id='240'>A day will come when York shall claim his own;</span><br/>
<span id='241'>And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts</span><br/>
<span id='242'>And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,</span><br/>
<span id='243'>And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,</span><br/>
<span id='244'>For that's the golden mark I seek to hit:</span><br/>
<span id='245'>Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,</span><br/>
<span id='246'>Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,</span><br/>
<span id='247'>Nor wear the diadem upon his head,</span><br/>
<span id='248'>Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.</span><br/>
<span id='249'>Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:</span><br/>
<span id='250'>Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,</span><br/>
<span id='251'>To pry into the secrets of the state;</span><br/>
<span id='252'>Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,</span><br/>
<span id='253'>With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,</span><br/>
<span id='254'>And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:</span><br/>
<span id='255'>Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,</span><br/>
<span id='256'>With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed;</span><br/>
<span id='257'>And in my standard bear the arms of York</span><br/>
<span id='258'>To grapple with the house of Lancaster;</span><br/>
<span id='259'>And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,</span><br/>
<span id='260'>Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.</span><br/>

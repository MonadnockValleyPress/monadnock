<h1>Two Gentlemen of Verona</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The same. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LAUNCE, leading a dog</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I</span><br/>
<span id='3'>have received my proportion, like the prodigious</span><br/>
<span id='4'>son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's</span><br/>
<span id='5'>court. I think Crab, my dog, be the sourest-natured</span><br/>
<span id='6'>dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father</span><br/>
<span id='7'>wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat</span><br/>
<span id='8'>wringing her hands, and all our house in a great</span><br/>
<span id='9'>perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed</span><br/>
<span id='10'>one tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and</span><br/>
<span id='11'>has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have</span><br/>
<span id='12'>wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my</span><br/>
<span id='14'>parting. Nay, I'll show you the manner of it. This</span><br/>
<span id='15'>shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that</span><br/>
<span id='17'>cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it</span><br/>
<span id='18'>hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in</span><br/>
<span id='19'>it, is my mother, and this my father; a vengeance</span><br/>
<span id='20'>on't! there 'tis: now, sit, this staff is my</span><br/>
<span id='21'>sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and</span><br/>
<span id='22'>as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I</span><br/>
<span id='23'>am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the</span><br/>
<span id='24'>dog&mdash;Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now</span><br/>
<span id='28'>come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now</span><br/>
<span id='29'>like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there</span><br/>
<span id='30'>'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down. Now</span><br/>
<span id='31'>come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now</span><br/>
<span id='32'>the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a</span><br/>
<span id='33'>word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PANTHINO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PANTHINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is shipped</span><br/>
<span id='35'>and thou art to post after with oars. What's the</span><br/>
<span id='36'>matter? why weepest thou, man? Away, ass! You'll</span><br/>
<span id='37'>lose the tide, if you tarry any longer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is the</span><br/>
<span id='39'>unkindest tied that ever any man tied.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PANTHINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>What's the unkindest tide?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Why, he that's tied here, Crab, my dog.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PANTHINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood, and, in</span><br/>
<span id='43'>losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing</span><br/>
<span id='44'>thy voyage, lose thy master, and, in losing thy</span><br/>
<span id='45'>master, lose thy service, and, in losing thy</span><br/>
<span id='46'>service,&mdash;Why dost thou stop my mouth?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PANTHINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Where should I lose my tongue?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>In thy tale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PANTHINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>In thy tail!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and</span><br/>
<span id='52'>the service, and the tied! Why, man, if the river</span><br/>
<span id='53'>were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the</span><br/>
<span id='54'>wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PANTHINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Come, come away, man; I was sent to call thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Sir, call me what thou darest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PANTHINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Wilt thou go?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Well, I will go.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>King John</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Lewis's camp at St. Edmundsbury.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter, in arms, LEWIS, SALISBURY, MELUN, PEMBROKE, BIGOT, and Soldiers</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LEWIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And keep it safe for our remembrance:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Return the precedent to these lords again;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>That, having our fair order written down,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>May know wherefore we took the sacrament</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Upon our sides it never shall be broken.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear</span><br/>
<span id='10'>A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>I am not glad that such a sore of time</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And heal the inveterate canker of one wound</span><br/>
<span id='15'>By making many. O, it grieves my soul,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>That I must draw this metal from my side</span><br/>
<span id='17'>To be a widow-maker! O, and there</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Where honourable rescue and defence</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!</span><br/>
<span id='20'>But such is the infection of the time,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>That, for the health and physic of our right,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>We cannot deal but with the very hand</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Of stern injustice and confused wrong.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And is't not pity, O my grieved friends,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>That we, the sons and children of this isle,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Were born to see so sad an hour as this;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Wherein we step after a stranger march</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Her enemies' ranks,&mdash;I must withdraw and weep</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Upon the spot of this enforced cause,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>To grace the gentry of a land remote,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And follow unacquainted colours here?</span><br/>
<span id='33'>What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!</span><br/>
<span id='34'>That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And grapple thee unto a pagan shore;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Where these two Christian armies might combine</span><br/>
<span id='38'>The blood of malice in a vein of league,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And not to spend it so unneighbourly!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>LEWIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>A noble temper dost thou show in this;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And great affections wrestling in thy bosom</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Doth make an earthquake of nobility.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>O, what a noble combat hast thou fought</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Between compulsion and a brave respect!</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Let me wipe off this honourable dew,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Being an ordinary inundation;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>But this effusion of such manly drops,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Figured quite o'er with burning meteors.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And with a great heart heave away the storm:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Commend these waters to those baby eyes</span><br/>
<span id='57'>That never saw the giant world enraged;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Into the purse of rich prosperity</span><br/>
<span id='62'>As Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And even there, methinks, an angel spake:</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH</em></p>
<span id='65'>Look, where the holy legate comes apace,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>To give us warrant from the hand of heaven</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And on our actions set the name of right</span><br/>
<span id='68'>With holy breath.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CARDINAL PANDULPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>                  Hail, noble prince of France!</span><br/>
<span id='70'>The next is this, King John hath reconciled</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>That so stood out against the holy church,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>The great metropolis and see of Rome:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And tame the savage spirit of wild war,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>That like a lion foster'd up at hand,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>It may lie gently at the foot of peace,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And be no further harmful than in show.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LEWIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I am too high-born to be propertied,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>To be a secondary at control,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Or useful serving-man and instrument,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>To any sovereign state throughout the world.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Between this chastised kingdom and myself,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And brought in matter that should feed this fire;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out</span><br/>
<span id='88'>With that same weak wind which enkindled it.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>You taught me how to know the face of right,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Acquainted me with interest to this land,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And come ye now to tell me John hath made</span><br/>
<span id='93'>His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?</span><br/>
<span id='94'>I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>What men provided, what munition sent,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>To underprop this action? Is't not I</span><br/>
<span id='101'>That undergo this charge? who else but I,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>And such as to my claim are liable,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Sweat in this business and maintain this war?</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Have I not heard these islanders shout out</span><br/>
<span id='105'>'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Have I not here the best cards for the game,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>To win this easy match play'd for a crown?</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?</span><br/>
<span id='109'>No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CARDINAL PANDULPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>You look but on the outside of this work.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LEWIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Outside or inside, I will not return</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Till my attempt so much be glorified</span><br/>
<span id='113'>As to my ample hope was promised</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Before I drew this gallant head of war,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>To outlook conquest and to win renown</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Even in the jaws of danger and of death.</span><br/>
<p><em>Trumpet sounds</em></p>
<span id='118'>What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the BASTARD, attended</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>According to the fair play of the world,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:</span><br/>
<span id='121'>My holy lord of Milan, from the king</span><br/>
<span id='122'>I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>And, as you answer, I do know the scope</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And warrant limited unto my tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CARDINAL PANDULPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>And will not temporize with my entreaties;</span><br/>
<span id='127'>He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>By all the blood that ever fury breathed,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>The youth says well. Now hear our English king;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>For thus his royalty doth speak in me.</span><br/>
<span id='131'>He is prepared, and reason too he should:</span><br/>
<span id='132'>This apish and unmannerly approach,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>The king doth smile at; and is well prepared</span><br/>
<span id='136'>To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>From out the circle of his territories.</span><br/>
<span id='138'>That hand which had the strength, even at your door,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>To dive like buckets in concealed wells,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>To crouch in litter of your stable planks,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out</span><br/>
<span id='144'>In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Even at the crying of your nation's crow,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>That in your chambers gave you chastisement?</span><br/>
<span id='149'>No: know the gallant monarch is in arms</span><br/>
<span id='150'>And like an eagle o'er his aery towers,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.</span><br/>
<span id='152'>And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;</span><br/>
<span id='155'>For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Like Amazons come tripping after drums,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts</span><br/>
<span id='159'>To fierce and bloody inclination.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LEWIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;</span><br/>
<span id='161'>We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;</span><br/>
<span id='162'>We hold our time too precious to be spent</span><br/>
<span id='163'>With such a brabbler.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CARDINAL PANDULPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Give me leave to speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>No, I will speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LEWIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>                  We will attend to neither.</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Plead for our interest and our being here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out;</span><br/>
<span id='170'>And so shall you, being beaten: do but start</span><br/>
<span id='171'>An echo with the clamour of thy drum,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And even at hand a drum is ready braced</span><br/>
<span id='173'>That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Sound but another, and another shall</span><br/>
<span id='175'>As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear</span><br/>
<span id='176'>And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Not trusting to this halting legate here,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Whom he hath used rather for sport than need</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits</span><br/>
<span id='180'>A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day</span><br/>
<span id='181'>To feast upon whole thousands of the French.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LEWIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>Strike up our drums, to find this danger out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

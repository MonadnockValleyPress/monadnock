<em>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,  POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The memory be green, and that it us befitted</span><br/>
<span id='3'>To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To be contracted in one brow of woe,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature</span><br/>
<span id='6'>That we with wisest sorrow think on him,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Together with remembrance of ourselves.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>The imperial jointress to this warlike state,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>With an auspicious and a dropping eye,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>In equal scale weighing delight and dole,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</span><br/>
<span id='16'>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Holding a weak supposal of our worth,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Or thinking by our late dear brother's death</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Importing the surrender of those lands</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>To our most valiant brother. So much for him.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Thus much the business is: we have here writ</span><br/>
<span id='28'>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Of this his nephew's purpose,&mdash;to suppress</span><br/>
<span id='31'>His further gait herein; in that the levies,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>The lists and full proportions, are all made</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Out of his subject: and we here dispatch</span><br/>
<span id='34'>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Giving to you no further personal power</span><br/>
<span id='37'>To business with the king, more than the scope</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Of these delated articles allow.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CORNELIUS and VOLTIMAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>In that and all things will we show our duty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</em></p>
<span id='42'>And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?</span><br/>
<span id='43'>You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?</span><br/>
<span id='44'>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?</span><br/>
<span id='47'>The head is not more native to the heart,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The hand more instrumental to the mouth,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>What wouldst thou have, Laertes?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>My dread lord,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Your leave and favour to return to France;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>To show my duty in your coronation,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave</span><br/>
<span id='60'>By laboursome petition, and at last</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>I do beseech you, give him leave to go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And thy best graces spend it at thy will!</span><br/>
<span id='65'>But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>[Aside]  A little more than kin, and less than kind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>How is it that the clouds still hang on you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Do not for ever with thy vailed lids</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Seek for thy noble father in the dust:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Passing through nature to eternity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Ay, madam, it is common.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>If it be,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Why seems it so particular with thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'</span><br/>
<span id='79'>'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Nor customary suits of solemn black,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>For they are actions that a man might play:</span><br/>
<span id='87'>But I have that within which passeth show;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>To give these mourning duties to your father:</span><br/>
<span id='91'>But, you must know, your father lost a father;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</span><br/>
<span id='93'>In filial obligation for some term</span><br/>
<span id='94'>To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever</span><br/>
<span id='95'>In obstinate condolement is a course</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>An understanding simple and unschool'd:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>For what we know must be and is as common</span><br/>
<span id='101'>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Why should we in our peevish opposition</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>To reason most absurd: whose common theme</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>From the first corse till he that died to-day,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth</span><br/>
<span id='109'>This unprevailing woe, and think of us</span><br/>
<span id='110'>As of a father: for let the world take note,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>You are the most immediate to our throne;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And with no less nobility of love</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Than that which dearest father bears his son,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Do I impart toward you. For your intent</span><br/>
<span id='115'>In going back to school in Wittenberg,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>It is most retrograde to our desire:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And we beseech you, bend you to remain</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:</span><br/>
<span id='121'>I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>I shall in all my best obey you, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but HAMLET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>O, that this too too solid flesh would melt,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd</span><br/>
<span id='134'>His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!</span><br/>
<span id='135'>How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Seem to me all the uses of this world!</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Possess it merely. That it should come to this!</span><br/>
<span id='140'>But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:</span><br/>
<span id='141'>So excellent a king; that was, to this,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother</span><br/>
<span id='143'>That he might not beteem the winds of heaven</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>As if increase of appetite had grown</span><br/>
<span id='147'>By what it fed on: and yet, within a month&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Let me not think on't&mdash;Frailty, thy name is woman!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='149'>A little month, or ere those shoes were old</span><br/>
<span id='150'>With which she follow'd my poor father's body,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Like Niobe, all tears:&mdash;why she, even she&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Would have mourn'd longer&mdash;married with my uncle,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>My father's brother, but no more like my father</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Than I to Hercules: within a month:</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>She married. O, most wicked speed, to post</span><br/>
<span id='159'>With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!</span><br/>
<span id='160'>It is not nor it cannot come to good:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO</em></p>

<span id='speech20'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>

<span id='162'>Hail to your lordship!</span><br/>

<span id='163'>I am glad to see you well:</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Horatio,&mdash;or I do forget myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:</span><br/>
<span id='167'>And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>My good lord&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.</span><br/>
<span id='170'>But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>A truant disposition, good my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>I would not hear your enemy say so,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>To make it truster of your own report</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Against yourself: I know you are no truant.</span><br/>
<span id='176'>But what is your affair in Elsinore?</span><br/>
<span id='177'>We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;</span><br/>
<span id='180'>I think it was to see my mother's wedding.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!</span><br/>
<span id='186'>My father!&mdash;methinks I see my father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Where, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>                  In my mind's eye, Horatio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>I saw him once; he was a goodly king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>He was a man, take him for all in all,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>I shall not look upon his like again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>

<span id='192'>My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>Saw? who?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>

<span id='194'>My lord, the king your father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>The king my father!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>Season your admiration for awhile</span><br/>
<span id='197'>With an attent ear, till I may deliver,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Upon the witness of these gentlemen,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>This marvel to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>For God's love, let me hear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>Two nights together had these gentlemen,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>In the dead vast and middle of the night,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Appears before them, and with solemn march</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd</span><br/>
<span id='208'>By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Almost to jelly with the act of fear,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me</span><br/>
<span id='212'>In dreadful secrecy impart they did;</span><br/>
<span id='213'>And I with them the third night kept the watch;</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Form of the thing, each word made true and good,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>The apparition comes: I knew your father;</span><br/>
<span id='217'>These hands are not more like.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>But where was this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='219'>My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='220'>Did you not speak to it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>My lord, I did;</span><br/>
<span id='222'>But answer made it none: yet once methought</span><br/>
<span id='223'>It lifted up its head and did address</span><br/>
<span id='224'>Itself to motion, like as it would speak;</span><br/>
<span id='225'>But even then the morning cock crew loud,</span><br/>
<span id='226'>And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,</span><br/>
<span id='227'>And vanish'd from our sight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='228'>'Tis very strange.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='229'>As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;</span><br/>
<span id='230'>And we did think it writ down in our duty</span><br/>
<span id='231'>To let you know of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='232'>Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.</span><br/>
<span id='233'>Hold you the watch to-night?</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='234'>We do, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='235'>Arm'd, say you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>MARCELLUS and BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='236'>Arm'd, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='237'>From top to toe?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>MARCELLUS and BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='238'>My lord, from head to foot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='239'>Then saw you not his face?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='240'>O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='241'>What, look'd he frowningly?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='242'>A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='243'>Pale or red?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='244'>Nay, very pale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='245'>                  And fix'd his eyes upon you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='246'>Most constantly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='247'>                  I would I had been there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='248'>It would have much amazed you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='249'>Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='250'>While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>MARCELLUS and BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='251'>Longer, longer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='252'>Not when I saw't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='253'>                  His beard was grizzled&mdash;no?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='254'>It was, as I have seen it in his life,</span><br/>
<span id='255'>A sable silver'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>

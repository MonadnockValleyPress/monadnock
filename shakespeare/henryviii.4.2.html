<h1>Henry VIII</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Kimbolton.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KATHARINE, Dowager, sick; led between GRIFFITH, her gentleman usher, and PATIENCE, her woman</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>How does your grace?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>O Griffith, sick to death!</span><br/>
<span id='3'>My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>        Yes, madam; but I think your grace,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>If well, he stepp'd before me, happily</span><br/>
<span id='12'>For my example.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>                  Well, the voice goes, madam:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>For after the stout Earl Northumberland</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill</span><br/>
<span id='18'>He could not sit his mule.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Alas, poor man!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>With all his covent, honourably received him;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To whom he gave these words, 'O, father abbot,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>An old man, broken with the storms of state,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Give him a little earth for charity!'</span><br/>
<span id='27'>So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Pursued him still: and, three nights after this,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>About the hour of eight, which he himself</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>He gave his honours to the world again,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And yet with charity. He was a man</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>His own opinion was his law: i' the presence</span><br/>
<span id='41'>He would say untruths; and be ever double</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Both in his words and meaning: he was never,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>His promises were, as he then was, mighty;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>But his performance, as he is now, nothing:</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Of his own body he was ill, and gave</span><br/>
<span id='47'>The clergy in example.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Noble madam,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues</span><br/>
<span id='50'>We write in water. May it please your highness</span><br/>
<span id='51'>To hear me speak his good now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Yes, good Griffith;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>I were malicious else.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>This cardinal,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And though he were unsatisfied in getting,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>He was most princely: ever witness for him</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Those twins Of learning that he raised in you,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>So excellent in art, and still so rising,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>For then, and not till then, he felt himself,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And found the blessedness of being little:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And, to add greater honours to his age</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Than man could give him, he died fearing God.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>After my death I wish no other herald,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>No other speaker of my living actions,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>To keep mine honour from corruption,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>With thy religious truth and modesty,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Now in his ashes honour: peace be with him!</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Patience, be near me still; and set me lower:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Cause the musicians play me that sad note</span><br/>
<span id='85'>I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating</span><br/>
<span id='86'>On that celestial harmony I go to.</span><br/>
<p><em>Sad and solemn music</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>She is asleep: good wench, let's sit down quiet,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>For fear we wake her: softly, gentle Patience.</span><br/>
<p><em>The vision. Enter, solemnly tripping one after  another, six personages, clad in white robes,  wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and golden  vizards on their faces; branches of bays or palm in  their hands. They first congee unto her, then  dance; and, at certain changes, the first two hold  a spare garland over her head; at which the other  four make reverent curtsies; then the two that held  the garland deliver the same to the other next two,  who observe the same order in their changes, and  holding the garland over her head: which done,  they deliver the same garland to the last two, who  likewise observe the same order: at which, as it  were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs  of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven:  and so in their dancing vanish, carrying the garland with them. The music continues</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Spirits of peace, where are ye? are ye all gone,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Madam, we are here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>It is not you I call for:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Saw ye none enter since I slept?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>None, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Invite me to a banquet; whose bright faces</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?</span><br/>
<span id='98'>They promised me eternal happiness;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel</span><br/>
<span id='100'>I am not worthy yet to wear: I shall, assuredly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Possess your fancy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Bid the music leave,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>They are harsh and heavy to me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Music ceases</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PATIENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Do you note</span><br/>
<span id='106'>How much her grace is alter'd on the sudden?</span><br/>
<span id='107'>How long her face is drawn? how pale she looks,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>She is going, wench: pray, pray.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PATIENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Heaven comfort her!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>An't like your grace,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>You are a saucy fellow:</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Deserve we no more reverence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>GRIFFITH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>You are to blame,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>To use so rude behavior; go to, kneel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>I humbly do entreat your highness' pardon;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>My haste made me unmannerly. There is staying</span><br/>
<span id='119'>A gentleman, sent from the king, to see you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Admit him entrance, Griffith: but this fellow</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Let me ne'er see again.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt GRIFFITH and Messenger</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter GRIFFITH, with CAPUCIUS</em></p>
<span id='122'>If my sight fail not,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>You should be lord ambassador from the emperor,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>My royal nephew, and your name Capucius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CAPUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Madam, the same; your servant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>O, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>The times and titles now are alter'd strangely</span><br/>
<span id='128'>With me since first you knew me. But, I pray you,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>What is your pleasure with me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CAPUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Noble lady,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>First mine own service to your grace; the next,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>The king's request that I would visit you;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Sends you his princely commendations,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And heartily entreats you take good comfort.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>O my good lord, that comfort comes too late;</span><br/>
<span id='137'>'Tis like a pardon after execution:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>That gentle physic, given in time, had cured me;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>But now I am past an comforts here, but prayers.</span><br/>
<span id='140'>How does his highness?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CAPUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Madam, in good health.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>So may he ever do! and ever flourish,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>When I shal l dwell with worms, and my poor name</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Banish'd the kingdom! Patience, is that letter,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>I caused you write, yet sent away?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PATIENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>No, madam.</span><br/>
<p><em>Giving it to KATHARINE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver</span><br/>
<span id='148'>This to my lord the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CAPUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Most willing, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>In which I have commended to his goodness</span><br/>
<span id='151'>The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='154'>She is young, and of a noble modest nature,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>I hope she will deserve well,&mdash;and a little</span><br/>
<span id='156'>To love her for her mother's sake, that loved him,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Is, that his noble grace would have some pity</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Upon my wretched women, that so long</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Of which there is not one, I dare avow,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>And now I should not lie, but will deserve</span><br/>
<span id='163'>For virtue and true beauty of the soul,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>For honesty and decent carriage,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>A right good husband, let him be a noble</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em.</span><br/>
<span id='167'>The last is, for my men; they are the poorest,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>But poverty could never draw 'em from me;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>And something over to remember me by:</span><br/>
<span id='171'>If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And able means, we had not parted thus.</span><br/>
<span id='173'>These are the whole contents: and, good my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>By that you love the dearest in this world,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the king</span><br/>
<span id='177'>To do me this last right.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CAPUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>By heaven, I will,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Or let me lose the fashion of a man!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>I thank you, honest lord. Remember me</span><br/>
<span id='181'>In all humility unto his highness:</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Say his long trouble now is passing</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Out of this world; tell him, in death I bless'd him,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Let me be used with honour: strew me over</span><br/>
<span id='189'>With maiden flowers, that all the world may know</span><br/>
<span id='190'>I was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Then lay me forth: although unqueen'd, yet like</span><br/>
<span id='192'>A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.</span><br/>
<span id='193'>I can no more.</span><br/>

<h4>Scene VII. Another room in the castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And you must put me in your heart for friend,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>That he which hath your noble father slain</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Pursued my life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>                  It well appears: but tell me</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Why you proceeded not against these feats,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>So crimeful and so capital in nature,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>You mainly were stirr'd up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>O, for two special reasons;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Lives almost by his looks; and for myself&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>My virtue or my plague, be it either which&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I could not but by her. The other motive,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Why to a public count I might not go,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Is the great love the general gender bear him;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Would have reverted to my bow again,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And not where I had aim'd them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>And so have I a noble father lost;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>A sister driven into desperate terms,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Whose worth, if praises may go back again,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Stood challenger on mount of all the age</span><br/>
<span id='31'>For her perfections: but my revenge will come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think</span><br/>
<span id='33'>That we are made of stuff so flat and dull</span><br/>
<span id='34'>That we can let our beard be shook with danger</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>I loved your father, and we love ourself;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
<span id='38'>How now! what news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>This to your majesty; this to the queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>From Hamlet! who brought them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>They were given me by Claudio; he received them</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Of him that brought them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Messenger</em></p>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='46'>'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on</span><br/>
<span id='47'>your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see</span><br/>
<span id='48'>your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your</span><br/>
<span id='49'>pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden</span><br/>
<span id='50'>and more strange return.                  'HAMLET.'</span><br/>
<span id='51'>What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Know you the hand?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Can you advise me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>It warms the very sickness in my heart,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>'Thus didest thou.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>If it be so, Laertes&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>As how should it be so? how otherwise?&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Will you be ruled by me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Ay, my lord;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>So you will not o'errule me to a peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>As checking at his voyage, and that he means</span><br/>
<span id='68'>No more to undertake it, I will work him</span><br/>
<span id='69'>To an exploit, now ripe in my device,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Under the which he shall not choose but fall:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>But even his mother shall uncharge the practise</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And call it accident.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>My lord, I will be ruled;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>The rather, if you could devise it so</span><br/>
<span id='76'>That I might be the organ.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>It falls right.</span><br/>
<span id='78'>You have been talk'd of since your travel much,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Did not together pluck such envy from him</span><br/>
<span id='82'>As did that one, and that, in my regard,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Of the unworthiest siege.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>What part is that, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>A very riband in the cap of youth,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes</span><br/>
<span id='87'>The light and careless livery that it wears</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Than settled age his sables and his weeds,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Importing health and graveness. Two months since,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Here was a gentleman of Normandy:&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>I've seen myself, and served against, the French,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And they can well on horseback: but this gallant</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured</span><br/>
<span id='96'>With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Come short of what he did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>A Norman was't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>A Norman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Upon my life, Lamond.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>The very same.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>I know him well: he is the brooch indeed</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And gem of all the nation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>He made confession of you,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And gave you such a masterly report</span><br/>
<span id='107'>For art and exercise in your defence</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And for your rapier most especially,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy</span><br/>
<span id='114'>That he could nothing do but wish and beg</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Now, out of this,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>What out of this, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Laertes, was your father dear to you?</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>A face without a heart?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Why ask you this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Not that I think you did not love your father;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>But that I know love is begun by time;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And that I see, in passages of proof,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.</span><br/>
<span id='126'>There lives within the very flame of love</span><br/>
<span id='127'>A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;</span><br/>
<span id='128'>And nothing is at a like goodness still;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>For goodness, growing to a plurisy,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Dies in his own too much: that we would do</span><br/>
<span id='131'>We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes</span><br/>
<span id='132'>And hath abatements and delays as many</span><br/>
<span id='133'>As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>To show yourself your father's son in deed</span><br/>
<span id='138'>More than in words?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>To cut his throat i' the church.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:</span><br/>
<span id='144'>We'll put on those shall praise your excellence</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And set a double varnish on the fame</span><br/>
<span id='146'>The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together</span><br/>
<span id='147'>And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Most generous and free from all contriving,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Or with a little shuffling, you may choose</span><br/>
<span id='151'>A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Requite him for your father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>I will do't:</span><br/>
<span id='154'>And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.</span><br/>
<span id='155'>I bought an unction of a mountebank,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Collected from all simples that have virtue</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Under the moon, can save the thing from death</span><br/>
<span id='160'>That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point</span><br/>
<span id='161'>With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>It may be death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>                  Let's further think of this;</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Weigh what convenience both of time and means</span><br/>
<span id='165'>May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And that our drift look through our bad performance,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Should have a back or second, that might hold,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:</span><br/>
<span id='170'>We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.</span><br/>
<span id='171'>When in your motion you are hot and dry&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>As make your bouts more violent to that end&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='173'>And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him</span><br/>
<span id='174'>A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Our purpose may hold there.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE</em></p>
<span id='177'>How now, sweet queen!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>One woe doth tread upon another's heel,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Drown'd! O, where?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>There is a willow grows aslant a brook,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;</span><br/>
<span id='183'>There with fantastic garlands did she come</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples</span><br/>
<span id='185'>That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:</span><br/>
<span id='187'>There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;</span><br/>
<span id='189'>When down her weedy trophies and herself</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;</span><br/>
<span id='191'>And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;</span><br/>
<span id='193'>As one incapable of her own distress,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Or like a creature native and indued</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Unto that element: but long it could not be</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay</span><br/>
<span id='198'>To muddy death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>                  Alas, then, she is drown'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>Drown'd, drown'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet</span><br/>
<span id='203'>It is our trick; nature her custom holds,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:</span><br/>
<span id='206'>I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>But that this folly douts it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>Let's follow, Gertrude:</span><br/>
<span id='209'>How much I had to do to calm his rage!</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Now fear I this will give it start again;</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Therefore let's follow.</span><br/>

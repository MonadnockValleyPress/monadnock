<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>The forest.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Can do all this that he hath promised?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Patience once more, whiles our compact is urged:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>You will bestow her on Orlando here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>And you say, you will have her, when I bring her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>You say, you'll marry me, if I be willing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PHEBE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>That will I, should I die the hour after.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>But if you do refuse to marry me,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PHEBE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>So is the bargain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>You say, that you'll have Phebe, if she will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Though to have her and death were both one thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>I have promised to make all this matter even.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>If she refuse me: and from hence I go,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>To make these doubts all even.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>I do remember in this shepherd boy</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>My lord, the first time that I ever saw him</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Methought he was a brother to your daughter:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Of many desperate studies by his uncle,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Whom he reports to be a great magician,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Obscured in the circle of this forest.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>JAQUES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>There is, sure, another flood toward, and these</span><br/>
<span id='36'>couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of</span><br/>
<span id='37'>very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Salutation and greeting to you all!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>JAQUES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the</span><br/>
<span id='40'>motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in</span><br/>
<span id='41'>the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>If any man doubt that, let him put me to my</span><br/>
<span id='43'>purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered</span><br/>
<span id='44'>a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth</span><br/>
<span id='45'>with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have</span><br/>
<span id='46'>had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>JAQUES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>And how was that ta'en up?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the</span><br/>
<span id='49'>seventh cause.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>JAQUES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>I like him very well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I</span><br/>
<span id='53'>press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country</span><br/>
<span id='54'>copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as</span><br/>
<span id='55'>marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor</span><br/>
<span id='57'>humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else</span><br/>
<span id='58'>will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a</span><br/>
<span id='59'>poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>JAQUES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the</span><br/>
<span id='63'>quarrel on the seventh cause?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Upon a lie seven times removed:&mdash;bear your body more</span><br/>
<span id='65'>seeming, Audrey:&mdash;as thus, sir. I did dislike the</span><br/>
<span id='66'>cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the</span><br/>
<span id='68'>mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.</span><br/>
<span id='69'>If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he</span><br/>
<span id='70'>would send me word, he cut it to please himself:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was</span><br/>
<span id='72'>not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is</span><br/>
<span id='73'>called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not</span><br/>
<span id='74'>well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this</span><br/>
<span id='75'>is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not</span><br/>
<span id='76'>well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>JAQUES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we</span><br/>
<span id='82'>measured swords and parted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>JAQUES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have</span><br/>
<span id='85'>books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the</span><br/>
<span id='88'>fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All</span><br/>
<span id='91'>these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may</span><br/>
<span id='92'>avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven</span><br/>
<span id='93'>justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the</span><br/>
<span id='94'>parties were met themselves, one of them thought but</span><br/>
<span id='95'>of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and</span><br/>
<span id='96'>they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the</span><br/>
<span id='97'>only peacemaker; much virtue in If.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>JAQUES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at</span><br/>
<span id='99'>any thing and yet a fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under</span><br/>
<span id='101'>the presentation of that he shoots his wit.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA</em></p>
<p><em>Still Music</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>HYMEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>        Then is there mirth in heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>When earthly things made even</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Atone together.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Good duke, receive thy daughter</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Hymen from heaven brought her,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Yea, brought her hither,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>That thou mightst join her hand with his</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Whose heart within his bosom is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>[To DUKE SENIOR]  To you I give myself, for I am yours.</span><br/>
<p><em>To ORLANDO</em></p>
<span id='111'>To you I give myself, for I am yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>PHEBE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>If sight and shape be true,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Why then, my love adieu!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I'll have no father, if you be not he:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>I'll have no husband, if you be not he:</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HYMEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>        Peace, ho! I bar confusion:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>'Tis I must make conclusion</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Of these most strange events:</span><br/>

<span id='129'>You and you are sure together,</span><br/>

<span id='131'>Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Feed yourselves with questioning;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>That reason wonder may diminish,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>How thus we met, and these things finish.</span><br/>

<span id='146'>Let me have audience for a word or two:</span><br/>
<span id='147'>I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Men of great worth resorted to this forest,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>In his own conduct, purposely to take</span><br/>
<span id='153'>His brother here and put him to the sword:</span><br/>
<span id='154'>And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Where meeting with an old religious man,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>After some question with him, was converted</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Both from his enterprise and from the world,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And all their lands restored to them again</span><br/>
<span id='160'>That were with him exiled. This to be true,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>I do engage my life.</span><br/>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Welcome, young man;</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:</span><br/>
<span id='164'>To one his lands withheld, and to the other</span><br/>
<span id='165'>A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.</span><br/>
<span id='166'>First, in this forest, let us do those ends</span><br/>
<span id='167'>That here were well begun and well begot:</span><br/>
<span id='168'>And after, every of this happy number</span><br/>
<span id='169'>That have endured shrewd days and nights with us</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Shall share the good of our returned fortune,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>According to the measure of their states.</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity</span><br/>

<span id='speech52'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>

<span id='196'>It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;</span><br/>
<span id='197'>but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord</span><br/>
<span id='198'>the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs</span><br/>
<span id='199'>no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no</span><br/>
<span id='200'>epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>and good plays prove the better by the help of good</span><br/>
<span id='202'>epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am</span><br/>
<span id='203'>neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with</span><br/>
<span id='204'>you in the behalf of a good play! I am not</span><br/>
<span id='205'>furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not</span><br/>
<span id='206'>become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin</span><br/>
<span id='207'>with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love</span><br/>
<span id='208'>you bear to men, to like as much of this play as</span><br/>
<span id='209'>please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love</span><br/>
<span id='210'>you bear to women&mdash;as I perceive by your simpering,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>none of you hates them&mdash;that between you and the</span><br/>
<span id='212'>women the play may please. If I were a woman I</span><br/>
<span id='213'>would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased</span><br/>
<span id='214'>me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I</span><br/>
<span id='215'>defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good</span><br/>
<span id='216'>beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my</span><br/>
<span id='217'>kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</span><br/>

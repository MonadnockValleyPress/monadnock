<h4>Gloucestershire. Before Shallow's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter SHALLOW and SILENCE, meeting; MOULDY,  SHADOW, WART, FEEBLE, BULLCALF, a Servant or two with them</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Come on, come on, come on, sir; give me your hand,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>sir, give me your hand, sir: an early stirrer, by</span><br/>
<span id='3'>the rood! And how doth my good cousin Silence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SILENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>And how doth my cousin, your bedfellow? and your</span><br/>
<span id='6'>fairest daughter and mine, my god-daughter Ellen?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SILENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>By yea and nay, sir, I dare say my cousin William is</span><br/>
<span id='9'>become a good scholar: he is at Oxford still, is he not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SILENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Indeed, sir, to my cost.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>A' must, then, to the inns o' court shortly. I was</span><br/>
<span id='12'>once of Clement's Inn, where I think they will</span><br/>
<span id='13'>talk of mad Shallow yet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SILENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>You were called 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>By the mass, I was called any thing; and I would</span><br/>
<span id='16'>have done any thing indeed too, and roundly too.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>and black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Will Squele, a Cotswold man; you had not four such</span><br/>
<span id='20'>swinge-bucklers in all the inns o' court again: and</span><br/>
<span id='21'>I may say to you, we knew where the bona-robas were</span><br/>
<span id='22'>and had the best of them all at commandment. Then</span><br/>
<span id='23'>was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page to</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SILENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>The same Sir John, the very same. I  see him break</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Skogan's head at the court-gate, when a' was a</span><br/>
<span id='28'>crack not thus high: and the very same day did I</span><br/>
<span id='29'>fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>behind Gray's Inn. Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that I</span><br/>
<span id='31'>have spent! and to see how many of my old</span><br/>
<span id='32'>acquaintance are dead!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SILENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>We shall all follow, cousin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SHADOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Certain, 'tis certain; very sure, very sure: death,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>as the Psalmist saith, is certain to all; all shall</span><br/>
<span id='36'>die. How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford fair?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SILENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>By my troth, I was not there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living</span><br/>
<span id='39'>yet?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>SILENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Dead, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Jesu, Jesu, dead! a' drew a good bow; and dead! a'</span><br/>
<span id='42'>shot a fine shoot: John a Gaunt loved him well, and</span><br/>
<span id='43'>betted much money on his head. Dead! a' would have</span><br/>
<span id='44'>clapped i' the clout at twelve score; and carried</span><br/>
<span id='45'>you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a</span><br/>
<span id='46'>half, that it would have done a man's heart good to</span><br/>
<span id='47'>see. How a score of ewes now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SILENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Thereafter as they be: a score of good ewes may be</span><br/>
<span id='49'>worth ten pounds.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>And is old Double dead?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SILENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Here come two of Sir John Falstaff's men, as I think.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BARDOLPH and one with him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Good morrow, honest gentlemen: I beseech you, which</span><br/>
<span id='53'>is Justice Shallow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>I am Robert Shallow, sir; a poor esquire of this</span><br/>
<span id='55'>county, and one of the king's justices of th e peace:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>What is your good pleasure with me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>My captain, sir, commends him to you; my captain,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Sir John Falstaff, a tall gentleman, by heaven, and</span><br/>
<span id='59'>a most gallant leader.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backsword</span><br/>
<span id='61'>man. How doth the good knight? may I ask how my</span><br/>
<span id='62'>lady his wife doth?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated than</span><br/>
<span id='64'>with a wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said</span><br/>
<span id='66'>indeed too. Better accommodated! it is good; yea,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>indeed, is it: good phrases are surely, and ever</span><br/>
<span id='68'>were, very commendable. Accommodated! it comes of</span><br/>
<span id='69'>'accommodo' very good; a good phrase.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word. Phrase call</span><br/>
<span id='71'>you it? by this good day, I know not the phrase;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a</span><br/>
<span id='73'>soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good</span><br/>
<span id='74'>command, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when a</span><br/>
<span id='75'>man is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>being, whereby a' may be thought to be accommodated;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>which is an excellent thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>It is very just.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter FALSTAFF</em></p>
<span id='79'>Look, here comes good Sir John. Give me your good</span><br/>
<span id='80'>hand, give me your worship's good hand: by my</span><br/>
<span id='81'>troth, you like well and bear your years very well:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>welcome, good Sir John.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Shallow: Master Surecard, as I think?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>No, Sir John; it is my cousin Silence, in commission with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be of</span><br/>
<span id='87'>the peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>SILENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Your good-worship is welcome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Fie! this is hot weather, gentlemen. Have you</span><br/>
<span id='90'>provided me here half a dozen sufficient men?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Let me see them, I beseech you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Where's the roll? where's the roll? where's the</span><br/>
<span id='94'>roll? Let me see, let me see, let me see. So, so:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>yea, marry, sir: Ralph Mouldy! Let them appear as</span><br/>
<span id='96'>I call; let them do so, let them do so. Let me</span><br/>
<span id='97'>see; where is Mouldy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>MOULDY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Here, an't please you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>What think you, Sir John? a good-limbed fellow;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>young, strong, and of good friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Is thy name Mouldy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MOULDY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Yea, an't please you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>'Tis the more time thou wert used.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith! Things that</span><br/>
<span id='105'>are mouldy lack use: very singular good! in faith,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>well said, Sir John, very well said.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Prick him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MOULDY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>I was pricked well enough before, an you could have</span><br/>
<span id='109'>let me alone: my old dame will be undone now for</span><br/>
<span id='110'>one to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you need</span><br/>
<span id='111'>not to have pricked me; there are other men fitter</span><br/>
<span id='112'>to go out than I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Go to: peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it is</span><br/>
<span id='114'>time you were spent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MOULDY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Spent!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside: know you where</span><br/>
<span id='117'>you are? For the other, Sir John: let me see:</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Simon Shadow!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under: he's like</span><br/>
<span id='120'>to be a cold soldier.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>

<span id='121'>Where's Shadow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>SHADOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Here, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Shadow, whose son art thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>SHADOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>My mother's son, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Thy mother's son! like enough, and thy father's</span><br/>
<span id='126'>shadow: so the son of the female is the shadow of</span><br/>
<span id='127'>the male: it is often so, indeed; but much of the</span><br/>
<span id='128'>father's substance!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Do you like him, Sir John?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Shadow will serve for summer; prick him, for we have</span><br/>
<span id='131'>a number of shadows to fill up the muster-book.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Thomas Wart!</span><br/>

<span id='133'>Where's he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>WART</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Here, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Is thy name Wart?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>WART</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Yea, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Thou art a very ragged wart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Shall I prick him down, Sir John?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>It were superfluous; for his apparel is built upon</span><br/>
<span id='140'>his back and the whole frame stands upon pins:</span><br/>
<span id='141'>prick him no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Ha, ha, ha! you can do it, sir; you can do it: I</span><br/>
<span id='143'>commend you well. Francis Feeble!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>FEEBLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Here, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>What trade art thou, Feeble?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>FEEBLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>A woman's tailor, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Shall I prick him, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>You may: but if he had been a man's tailor, he'ld</span><br/>
<span id='149'>ha' pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes in</span><br/>
<span id='150'>an enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>FEEBLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Well said, good woman's tailor! well said,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>courageous Feeble! thou wilt be as valiant as the</span><br/>
<span id='154'>wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the</span><br/>
<span id='155'>woman's tailor: well, Master Shallow; deep, Master Shallow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>FEEBLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>I would Wart might have gone, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst</span><br/>
<span id='158'>mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him</span><br/>
<span id='159'>to a private soldier that is the leader of so many</span><br/>
<span id='160'>thousands: let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>FEEBLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>It shall suffice, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>

<span id='162'>I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is next?</span><br/>

<span id='171'>What disease hast thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>BULLCALF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught</span><br/>
<span id='173'>with ringing in the king's affairs upon his</span><br/>
<span id='174'>coronation-day, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>

<span id='181'>Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry</span><br/>

<span id='183'>O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night</span><br/>
<span id='184'>in the windmill in Saint George's field?</span><br/>

<p><em>Exeunt Justices</em></p>
<span id='280'>On, Bardolph; lead the men away.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt BARDOLPH, Recruits,  & c</em></p>
<span id='281'>As I return, I will fetch off these justices: I do</span><br/>
<span id='282'>see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how</span><br/>
<span id='283'>subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This</span><br/>
<span id='284'>same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to</span><br/>
<span id='285'>me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he</span><br/>
<span id='286'>hath done about Turnbull Street: and every third</span><br/>
<span id='287'>word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's</span><br/>
<span id='288'>tribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a</span><br/>
<span id='289'>man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a'</span><br/>
<span id='290'>was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked</span><br/>
<span id='291'>radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it</span><br/>
<span id='292'>with a knife: a' was so forlorn, that his</span><br/>
<span id='293'>dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a'</span><br/>
<span id='294'>was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a</span><br/>
<span id='295'>monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' came</span><br/>
<span id='296'>ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those</span><br/>
<span id='297'>tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the</span><br/>
<span id='298'>carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or</span><br/>
<span id='299'>his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger</span><br/>
<span id='300'>become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a</span><br/>
<span id='301'>Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and</span><br/>
<span id='302'>I'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in the</span><br/>
<span id='303'>Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding</span><br/>
<span id='304'>among the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a</span><br/>
<span id='305'>Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have</span><br/>
<span id='306'>thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the</span><br/>
<span id='307'>case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a</span><br/>
<span id='308'>court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll</span><br/>
<span id='309'>be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall</span><br/>
<span id='310'>go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two</span><br/>
<span id='311'>stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the</span><br/>
<span id='312'>old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I</span><br/>
<span id='313'>may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.</span><br/>

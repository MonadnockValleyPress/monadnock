<h1>Twelfth Night</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</H3>
<h4>Olivia's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the</span><br/>
<span id='5'>count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>I saw't i' the orchard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>As plain as I see you now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>This was a great argument of love in her toward you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of</span><br/>
<span id='12'>judgment and reason.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>And they have been grand-jury-men since before Noah</span><br/>
<span id='14'>was a sailor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>She did show favour to the youth in your sight only</span><br/>
<span id='16'>to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to</span><br/>
<span id='17'>put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>You should then have accosted her; and with some</span><br/>
<span id='19'>excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should</span><br/>
<span id='20'>have banged the youth into dumbness. This was</span><br/>
<span id='21'>looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the</span><br/>
<span id='22'>double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash</span><br/>
<span id='23'>off, and you are now sailed into the north of my</span><br/>
<span id='24'>lady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicle</span><br/>
<span id='25'>on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by</span><br/>
<span id='26'>some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>An't be any way, it must be with valour; for policy</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a</span><br/>
<span id='29'>politician.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of</span><br/>
<span id='31'>valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight</span><br/>
<span id='32'>with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall</span><br/>
<span id='33'>take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no</span><br/>
<span id='34'>love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's</span><br/>
<span id='35'>commendation with woman than report of valour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun</span><br/>
<span id='40'>of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be</span><br/>
<span id='42'>amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of</span><br/>
<span id='43'>paper, although the sheet were big enough for the</span><br/>
<span id='44'>bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou</span><br/>
<span id='46'>write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Where shall I find you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit SIR ANDREW</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand</span><br/>
<span id='51'>strong, or so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>We shall have a rare letter from him: but you'll</span><br/>
<span id='53'>not deliver't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on the</span><br/>
<span id='55'>youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes</span><br/>
<span id='56'>cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were</span><br/>
<span id='57'>opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as</span><br/>
<span id='58'>will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of</span><br/>
<span id='59'>the anatomy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no</span><br/>
<span id='61'>great presage of cruelty.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MARIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself</span><br/>
<span id='64'>into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is</span><br/>
<span id='65'>turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Christian, that means to be saved by believing</span><br/>
<span id='67'>rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages</span><br/>
<span id='68'>of grossness. He's in yellow stockings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>And cross-gartered?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a school</span><br/>
<span id='71'>i' the church. I have dogged him, like his</span><br/>
<span id='72'>murderer. He does obey every point of the letter</span><br/>
<span id='73'>that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his</span><br/>
<span id='74'>face into more lines than is in the new map with the</span><br/>
<span id='75'>augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such</span><br/>
<span id='76'>a thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things</span><br/>
<span id='77'>at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>he'll smile and take't for a great favour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Come, bring us, bring us where he is.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h4>Petruchio's country house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GRUMIO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and</span><br/>
<span id='2'>all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever</span><br/>
<span id='3'>man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent</span><br/>
<span id='4'>before to make a fire, and they are coming after to</span><br/>
<span id='5'>warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon</span><br/>
<span id='6'>hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my</span><br/>
<span id='7'>tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my</span><br/>
<span id='8'>belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but</span><br/>
<span id='9'>I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>considering the weather, a taller man than I will</span><br/>
<span id='11'>take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CURTIS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Who is that calls so coldly?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide</span><br/>
<span id='14'>from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run</span><br/>
<span id='15'>but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast</span><br/>
<span id='18'>on no water.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou</span><br/>
<span id='21'>knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it</span><br/>
<span id='22'>hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and</span><br/>
<span id='23'>myself, fellow Curtis.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and</span><br/>
<span id='26'>so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a</span><br/>
<span id='27'>fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon</span><br/>
<span id='29'>feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and</span><br/>
<span id='32'>therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for</span><br/>
<span id='33'>my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as</span><br/>
<span id='36'>will thaw.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Come, you are so full of cony-catching!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house</span><br/>
<span id='40'>trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the</span><br/>
<span id='41'>serving-men in their new fustian, their white</span><br/>
<span id='42'>stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>the carpets laid, and every thing in order?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>First, know, my horse is tired; my master and</span><br/>
<span id='47'>mistress fallen out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>How?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby</span><br/>
<span id='50'>hangs a tale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Let's ha't, good Grumio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Lend thine ear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>There.</span><br/>
<p><em>Strikes him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this</span><br/>
<span id='57'>cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech</span><br/>
<span id='58'>listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a</span><br/>
<span id='59'>foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Both of one horse?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>What's that to thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Why, a horse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she</span><br/>
<span id='65'>under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how</span><br/>
<span id='66'>miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her</span><br/>
<span id='67'>with the horse upon her, how he beat me because</span><br/>
<span id='68'>her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt</span><br/>
<span id='69'>to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>that never prayed before, how I cried, how the</span><br/>
<span id='71'>horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I</span><br/>
<span id='72'>lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>which now shall die in oblivion and thou return</span><br/>
<span id='74'>unexperienced to thy grave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall</span><br/>
<span id='77'>find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be</span><br/>
<span id='80'>sleekly combed, their blue coats brushed, and their</span><br/>
<span id='81'>garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy</span><br/>
<span id='82'>with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair</span><br/>
<span id='83'>of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their</span><br/>
<span id='84'>hands. Are they all ready?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>They are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Call them forth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to</span><br/>
<span id='88'>countenance my mistress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Why, she hath a face of her own.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Who knows not that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Thou, it seems, that calls for company to</span><br/>
<span id='92'>countenance her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CURTIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>I call them forth to credit her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter four or five Serving-men</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>NATHANIEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Welcome home, Grumio!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>PHILIP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>How now, Grumio!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>JOSEPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>What, Grumio!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>NICHOLAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Fellow Grumio!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>NATHANIEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>How now, old lad?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Welcome, you;&mdash;how now, you;&mdash; what, you;&mdash;fellow,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>you;&mdash;and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce</span><br/>
<span id='102'>companions, is all ready, and all things neat?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>NATHANIEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>All things is ready. How near is our master?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be</span><br/>
<span id='105'>not&mdash;Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Where be these knaves? What, no man at door</span><br/>
<span id='107'>To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?</span><br/>

<span id='114'>Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel;</span><br/>
<span id='120'>There was no link to colour Peter's hat,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.</span><br/>

<span id='160'>And I expressly am forbid to touch it,</span><br/>

<span id='180'>For then she never looks upon her lure.</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Another way I have to man my haggard,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>To make her come and know her keeper's call,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites</span><br/>

<span id='192'>That all is done in reverend care of her;</span><br/>

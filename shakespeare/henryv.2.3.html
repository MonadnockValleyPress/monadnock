<h1>Henry V</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene III</h3>
<h4>London. Before a tavern.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter PISTOL, Hostess, NYM, BARDOLPH, and Boy</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Hostess</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to Staines.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>No; for my manly heart doth yearn.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Bardolph, be blithe: Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Boy, bristle thy courage up; for Falstaff he is dead,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And we must yearn therefore.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in</span><br/>
<span id='7'>heaven or in hell!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Hostess</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Nay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur's</span><br/>
<span id='9'>bosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom. A' made</span><br/>
<span id='10'>a finer end and went away an it had been any</span><br/>
<span id='11'>christom child; a' parted even just between twelve</span><br/>
<span id='12'>and one, even at the turning o' the tide: for after</span><br/>
<span id='13'>I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with</span><br/>
<span id='14'>flowers and smile upon his fingers' ends, I knew</span><br/>
<span id='15'>there was but one way; for his nose was as sharp as</span><br/>
<span id='16'>a pen, and a' babbled of green fields. 'How now,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>sir John!' quoth I	'what, man! be o' good</span><br/>
<span id='18'>cheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three or</span><br/>
<span id='19'>four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him a'</span><br/>
<span id='20'>should not think of God; I hoped there was no need</span><br/>
<span id='21'>to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So</span><br/>
<span id='22'>a' bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put my</span><br/>
<span id='23'>hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as</span><br/>
<span id='24'>cold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, and</span><br/>
<span id='25'>they were as cold as any stone, and so upward and</span><br/>
<span id='26'>upward, and all was as cold as any stone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>They say he cried out of sack.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Hostess</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Ay, that a' did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>And of women.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Hostess</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Nay, that a' did not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Boy</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Yes, that a' did; and said they were devils</span><br/>
<span id='32'>incarnate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Hostess</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>A' could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour he</span><br/>
<span id='34'>never liked.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Boy</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>A' said once, the devil would have him about women.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Hostess</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>A' did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but then</span><br/>
<span id='37'>he was rheumatic, and talked of the whore of Babylon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Boy</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Do you not remember, a' saw a flea stick upon</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Bardolph's nose, and a' said it was a black soul</span><br/>
<span id='40'>burning in hell-fire?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>that's all the riches I got in his service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Shall we shog? the king will be gone from</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Southampton.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Look to my chattels and my movables:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Let senses rule; the word is 'Pitch and Pay:'</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Trust none;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Therefore, Caveto be thy counsellor.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Go, clear thy crystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Let us to France; like horse-leeches, my boys,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Boy</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>And that's but unwholesome food they say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Touch her soft mouth, and march.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Farewell, hostess.</span><br/>
<p><em>Kissing her</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>I cannot kiss, that is the humour of it; but, adieu.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Let housewifery appear: keep close, I thee command.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Hostess</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Farewell; adieu.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

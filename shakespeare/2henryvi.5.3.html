<h1>Henry VI, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Fields near St. Alban's.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Alarum. Retreat. Enter YORK, RICHARD, WARWICK, and Soldiers, with drum and colours</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Of Salisbury, who can report of him,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>That winter lion, who in rage forgets</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Aged contusions and all brush of time,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Repairs him with occasion? This happy day</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>If Salisbury be lost.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>My noble father,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Three times to-day I holp him to his horse,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Three times bestrid him; thrice I led him off,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Persuaded him from any further act:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>But still, where danger was, still there I met him;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And like rich hangings in a homely house,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>So was his will in his old feeble body.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>But, noble as he is, look where he comes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SALISBURY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought to-day;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>By the mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>God knows how long it is I have to live;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And it hath pleased him that three times to-day</span><br/>
<span id='20'>You have defended me from imminent death.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Well, lords, we have not got that which we have:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Being opposites of such repairing nature.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>I know our safety is to follow them;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>For, as I hear, the king is fled to London,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>To call a present court of parliament.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>What says Lord Warwick? shall we after them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>After them! nay, before them, if we can.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Now, by my faith, lords, 'twas a glorious day:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Saint Alban's battle won by famous York</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Shall be eternized in all age to come.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Sound drums and trumpets, and to London all:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And more such days as these to us befall!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>As You Like It</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>The Forest of Arden.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ROSALIND for Ganymede, CELIA for Aliena, and TOUCHSTONE</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's</span><br/>
<span id='4'>apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort</span><br/>
<span id='5'>the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show</span><br/>
<span id='6'>itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>good Aliena!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>I pray you, bear with me; I cannot go no further.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear</span><br/>
<span id='10'>you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>for I think you have no money in your purse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Well, this is the forest of Arden.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was</span><br/>
<span id='14'>at home, I was in a better place: but travellers</span><br/>
<span id='15'>must be content.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Ay, be so, good Touchstone.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CORIN and SILVIUS</em></p>
<span id='17'>Look you, who comes here; a young man and an old in</span><br/>
<span id='18'>solemn talk.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CORIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>That is the way to make her scorn you still.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CORIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover</span><br/>
<span id='24'>As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>But if thy love were ever like to mine&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>As sure I think did never man love so&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>How many actions most ridiculous</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CORIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Into a thousand that I have forgotten.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!</span><br/>
<span id='31'>If thou remember'st not the slightest folly</span><br/>
<span id='32'>That ever love did make thee run into,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Thou hast not loved:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Thou hast not loved:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Or if thou hast not broke from company</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Thou hast not loved.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>I have by hard adventure found mine own.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke</span><br/>
<span id='44'>my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for</span><br/>
<span id='45'>coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the</span><br/>
<span id='46'>kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her</span><br/>
<span id='47'>pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the</span><br/>
<span id='48'>wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took</span><br/>
<span id='49'>two cods and, giving her them again, said with</span><br/>
<span id='50'>weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are</span><br/>
<span id='51'>true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is</span><br/>
<span id='52'>mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I</span><br/>
<span id='55'>break my shins against it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Is much upon my fashion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>And mine; but it grows something stale with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>I pray you, one of you question yond man</span><br/>
<span id='60'>If he for gold will give us any food:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>I faint almost to death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Holla, you clown!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Peace, fool: he's not thy kinsman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CORIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Who calls?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Your betters, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CORIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>                  Else are they very wretched.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CORIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Can in this desert place buy entertainment,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And faints for succor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>CORIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Fair sir, I pity her</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>My fortunes were more able to relieve her;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>But I am shepherd to another man</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>My master is of churlish disposition</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And little recks to find the way to heaven</span><br/>
<span id='81'>By doing deeds of hospitality:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>By reason of his absence, there is nothing</span><br/>
<span id='85'>That you will feed on; but what is, come see.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And in my voice most welcome shall you be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>CORIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>That little cares for buying any thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>CELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>And we will mend thy wages. I like this place.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And willingly could waste my time in it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>CORIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Assuredly the thing is to be sold:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Go with me: if you like upon report</span><br/>
<span id='97'>The soil, the profit and this kind of life,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>I will your very faithful feeder be</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And buy it with your gold right suddenly.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

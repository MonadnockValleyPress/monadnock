<h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Juliet's chamber.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter JULIET and Nurse</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>For I have need of many orisons</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To move the heavens to smile upon my state,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LADY CAPULET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries</span><br/>
<span id='8'>As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>So please you, let me now be left alone,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And let the nurse this night sit up with you;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>In this so sudden business.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Good night:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>That almost freezes up the heat of life:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I'll call them back again to comfort me:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Nurse! What should she do here?</span><br/>
<span id='20'>My dismal scene I needs must act alone.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Come, vial.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>What if this mixture do not work at all?</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?</span><br/>
<span id='24'>No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.</span><br/>
<p><em>Laying down her dagger</em></p>
<span id='25'>What if it be a poison, which the friar</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Because he married me before to Romeo?</span><br/>
<span id='29'>I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>For he hath still been tried a holy man.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>How if, when I am laid into the tomb,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>I wake before the time that Romeo</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Or, if I live, is it not very like,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>The horrible conceit of death and night,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Together with the terror of the place,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Where, for these many hundred years, the bones</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Of all my buried ancestors are packed:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>At some hours in the night spirits resort;&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Alack, alack, is it not like that I,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>So early waking, what with loathsome smells,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Environed with all these hideous fears?</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And madly play with my forefather's joints?</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?</span><br/>
<span id='56'>O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>She falls upon her bed, within the curtains</em></p>

<h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Friar Laurence's cell.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter FRIAR LAURENCE</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And thou art wedded to calamity.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ROMEO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?</span><br/>
<span id='5'>What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>That I yet know not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Too familiar</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Is my dear son with such sour company:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Not body's death, but body's banishment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'</span><br/>
<span id='14'>For exile hath more terror in his look,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Hence from Verona art thou banished:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>There is no world without Verona walls,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>But purgatory, torture, hell itself.</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And world's exile is death: then banished,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And turn'd that black word death to banishment:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And little mouse, every unworthy thing,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Live here in heaven and may look on her;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>But Romeo may not: more validity,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>More honourable state, more courtship lives</span><br/>
<span id='36'>In carrion-flies than Romeo: they may seize</span><br/>
<span id='37'>On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And steal immortal blessing from her lips,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Who even in pure and vestal modesty,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>But Romeo may not; he is banished:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>They are free men, but I am banished.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>But 'banished' to kill me?&mdash;'banished'?</span><br/>
<span id='48'>O friar, the damned use that word in hell;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>To mangle me with that word 'banished'?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>To comfort thee, though thou art banished.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>O, then I see that madmen have no ears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Doting like me and like me banished,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And fall upon the ground, as I do now,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Taking the measure of an unmade grave.</span><br/>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Knocking</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;</span><br/>
<p><em>Knocking</em></p>
<span id='77'>Run to my study. By and by! God's will,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>What simpleness is this! I come, I come!</span><br/>
<p><em>Knocking</em></p>
<span id='79'>Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>[Within]  Let me come in, and you shall know</span><br/>
<span id='81'>my errand;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>I come from Lady Juliet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Welcome, then.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Nurse</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>O, he is even in my mistress' case,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Just in her case! O woful sympathy!</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Why should you fall into so deep an O?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Nurse!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Doth she not think me an old murderer,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy</span><br/>
<span id='99'>With blood removed but little from her own?</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Where is she? and how doth she? and what says</span><br/>
<span id='101'>My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And then down falls again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>As if that name,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Shot from the deadly level of a gun,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>In what vile part of this anatomy</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack</span><br/>
<span id='112'>The hateful mansion.</span><br/>
<p><em>Drawing his sword</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Hold thy desperate hand:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote</span><br/>
<span id='116'>The unreasonable fury of a beast:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Unseemly woman in a seeming man!</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>I thought thy disposition better temper'd.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>By doing damned hate upon thyself?</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet</span><br/>
<span id='126'>In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And usest none in that true use indeed</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Digressing from the valour of a man;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Misshapen in the conduct of them both,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Is set afire by thine own ignorance,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.</span><br/>
<span id='140'>What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;</span><br/>
<span id='142'>There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:</span><br/>
<span id='144'>The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:</span><br/>
<span id='146'>A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Happiness courts thee in her best array;</span><br/>
<span id='148'>But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:</span><br/>
<span id='153'>But look thou stay not till the watch be set,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time</span><br/>
<span id='156'>To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back</span><br/>
<span id='158'>With twenty hundred thousand times more joy</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;</span><br/>
<span id='161'>And bid her hasten all the house to bed,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Romeo is coming.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night</span><br/>
<span id='165'>To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!</span><br/>
<span id='166'>My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>How well my comfort is revived by this!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Either be gone before the watch be set,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Or by the break of day disguised from hence:</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>And he shall signify from time to time</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Every good hap to you that chances here:</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>But that a joy past joy calls out on me,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

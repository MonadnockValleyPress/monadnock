<h1>The Tempest</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene III</H3>
<h4>Another part of the island.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GONZALO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>I needs must rest me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ALONSO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Old lord, I cannot blame thee,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Who am myself attach'd with weariness,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Even here I will put off my hope and keep it</span><br/>
<span id='9'>No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  I am right glad that he's so</span><br/>
<span id='13'>out of hope.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose</span><br/>
<span id='15'>That you resolved to effect.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>[Aside to ANTONIO]  The next advantage</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Will we take throughly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  Let it be to-night;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance</span><br/>
<span id='21'>As when they are fresh.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>[Aside to ANTONIO]  I say, to-night: no more.</span><br/>
<p><em>Solemn and strange music</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ALONSO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>GONZALO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Marvellous sweet music!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several  strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet;  they dance about it with gentle actions of  salutation; and, inviting the King,  & c. to eat, they depart</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ALONSO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>A living drollery. Now I will believe</span><br/>
<span id='27'>That there are unicorns, that in Arabia</span><br/>
<span id='28'>There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix</span><br/>
<span id='29'>At this hour reigning there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>I'll believe both;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And what does else want credit, come to me,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did</span><br/>
<span id='33'>lie,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Though fools at home condemn 'em.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GONZALO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>If in Naples</span><br/>
<span id='36'>I should report this now, would they believe me?</span><br/>
<span id='37'>If I should say, I saw such islanders&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>For, certes, these are people of the island&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Their manners are more gentle-kind than of</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Our human generation you shall find</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Many, nay, almost any.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>[Aside]              Honest lord,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Thou hast said well; for some of you there present</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Are worse than devils.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ALONSO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>I cannot too much muse</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Although they want the use of tongue, a kind</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Of excellent dumb discourse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>[Aside]	Praise in departing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>FRANCISCO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>They vanish'd strangely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>No matter, since</span><br/>
<span id='53'>They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Will't please you taste of what is here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ALONSO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Not I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>GONZALO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Who would believe that there were mountaineers</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Each putter-out of five for one will bring us</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Good warrant of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ALONSO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>                  I will stand to and feed,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Although my last: no matter, since I feel</span><br/>
<span id='65'>The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Stand to and do as we.</span><br/>
<p><em>Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a  harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ARIEL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>That hath to instrument this lower world</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And even with such-like valour men hang and drown</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Their proper selves.</span><br/>
<p><em>ALONSO, SEBASTIAN  & c. draw their swords</em></p>
<span id='75'>You fools! I and my fellows</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Are ministers of Fate: the elements,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish</span><br/>
<span id='80'>One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Your swords are now too massy for your strengths</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And will not be uplifted. But remember&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>For that's my business to you&mdash;that you three</span><br/>
<span id='85'>From Milan did supplant good Prospero;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed</span><br/>
<span id='88'>The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Lingering perdition, worse than any death</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Can be at once, shall step by step attend</span><br/>
<span id='94'>You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Upon your heads&mdash;is nothing but heart-sorrow</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And a clear life ensuing.</span><br/>
<p><em>He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music  enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated</span><br/>
<span id='101'>In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life</span><br/>
<span id='102'>And observation strange, my meaner ministers</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Their several kinds have done. My high charms work</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And these mine enemies are all knit up</span><br/>
<span id='105'>In their distractions; they now are in my power;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And in these fits I leave them, while I visit</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And his and mine loved darling.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit above</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>GONZALO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you</span><br/>
<span id='110'>In this strange stare?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ALONSO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>O, it is monstrous, monstrous:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;</span><br/>
<span id='113'>The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced</span><br/>
<span id='115'>The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and</span><br/>
<span id='117'>I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded</span><br/>
<span id='118'>And with him there lie mudded.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>But one fiend at a time,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>I'll fight their legions o'er.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>I'll be thy second.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>GONZALO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Like poison given to work a great time after,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you</span><br/>
<span id='125'>That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly</span><br/>
<span id='126'>And hinder them from what this ecstasy</span><br/>
<span id='127'>May now provoke them to.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>ADRIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Follow, I pray you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

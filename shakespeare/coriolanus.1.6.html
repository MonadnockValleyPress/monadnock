<h1>Coriolanus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene VI</h3>
<h4>Near the camp of Cominius.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter COMINIUS, as it were in retire, with soldiers</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Breathe you, my friends: well fought;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>we are come off</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>By interims and conveying gusts we have heard</span><br/>
<span id='7'>The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Lead their successes as we wish our own,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>That both our powers, with smiling</span><br/>
<span id='10'>fronts encountering,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>May give you thankful sacrifice.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
<span id='12'>Thy news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>The citizens of Corioli have issued,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>I saw our party to their trenches driven,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And then I came away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Though thou speak'st truth,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Methinks thou speak'st not well.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>How long is't since?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Above an hour, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And bring thy news so late?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Spies of the Volsces</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Half an hour since brought my report.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Who's yonder,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods</span><br/>
<span id='30'>He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Before-time seen him thus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>[Within]                 Come I too late?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour</span><br/>
<span id='34'>More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue</span><br/>
<span id='35'>From every meaner man.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MARCIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Come I too late?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>But mantled in your own.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>O, let me clip ye</span><br/>
<span id='40'>In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart</span><br/>
<span id='41'>As merry as when our nuptial day was done,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And tapers burn'd to bedward!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Flower of warriors,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>How is it with Titus Lartius?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>As with a man busied about decrees:</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Condemning some to death, and some to exile;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>To let him slip at will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Where is that slave</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Where is he? call him hither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Let him alone;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>The common file&mdash;a plague! tribunes for them!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge</span><br/>
<span id='58'>From rascals worse than they.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>But how prevail'd you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?</span><br/>
<span id='62'>If not, why cease you till you are so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Marcius,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>We have at disadvantage fought and did</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Retire to win our purpose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>How lies their battle? know you on which side</span><br/>
<span id='67'>They have placed their men of trust?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>As I guess, Marcius,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Their very heart of hope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>I do beseech you,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>By all the battles wherein we have fought,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>By the blood we have shed together, by the vows</span><br/>
<span id='75'>We have made to endure friends, that you directly</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And that you not delay the present, but,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>We prove this very hour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Though I could wish</span><br/>
<span id='81'>You were conducted to a gentle bath</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Deny your asking: take your choice of those</span><br/>
<span id='84'>That best can aid your action.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Those are they</span><br/>
<span id='86'>That most are willing. If any such be here&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>As it were sin to doubt&mdash;that love this painting</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Lesser his person than an ill report;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>If any think brave death outweighs bad life</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And that his country's dearer than himself;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Let him alone, or so many so minded,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Wave thus, to express his disposition,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And follow Marcius.</span><br/>
<p><em>They all shout and wave their swords, take him up in their arms, and cast up their caps</em></p>
<span id='95'>O, me alone! make you a sword of me?</span><br/>
<span id='96'>If these shows be not outward, which of you</span><br/>
<span id='97'>But is four Volsces? none of you but is</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Able to bear against the great Aufidius</span><br/>
<span id='99'>A shield as hard as his. A certain number,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Though thanks to all, must I select</span><br/>
<span id='101'>from all: the rest</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Shall bear the business in some other fight,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And four shall quickly draw out my command,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Which men are best inclined.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>March on, my fellows:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Make good this ostentation, and you shall</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Divide in all with us.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

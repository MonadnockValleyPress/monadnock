<h1>Henry IV, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Gloucestershire. Shallow's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter SHALLOW, FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, and Page</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away to-night.</span><br/>
<span id='2'>What, Davy, I say!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>I will not excuse you; you shall not be excused;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>excuses shall not be admitted; there is no excuse</span><br/>
<span id='6'>shall serve; you shall not be excused. Why, Davy!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DAVY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DAVY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Here, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy, let me see, Davy; let me</span><br/>
<span id='9'>see, Davy; let me see: yea, marry, William cook,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>bid him come hither. Sir John, you shall not be excused.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DAVY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Marry, sir, thus; those precepts cannot be served:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>and, again, sir, shall we sow the headland with wheat?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook: are</span><br/>
<span id='14'>there no young pigeons?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DAVY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Yes, sir. Here is now the smith's note for shoeing</span><br/>
<span id='16'>and plough-irons.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Let it be cast and paid. Sir John, you shall not be excused.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DAVY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must need be</span><br/>
<span id='19'>had: and, sir, do you mean to stop any of William's</span><br/>
<span id='20'>wages, about the sack he lost the other day at</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Hinckley fair?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>A' shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a couple</span><br/>
<span id='23'>of short-legged hens, a joint of mutton, and any</span><br/>
<span id='24'>pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William cook.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DAVY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Yea, Davy. I will use him well: a friend i' the</span><br/>
<span id='27'>court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men</span><br/>
<span id='28'>well, Davy; for they are arrant knaves, and will backbite.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DAVY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>No worse than they are backbitten, sir; for they</span><br/>
<span id='30'>have marvellous foul linen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Well conceited, Davy: about thy business, Davy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DAVY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor of</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Woncot against Clement Perkes of the hill.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>There is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>that Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DAVY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but</span><br/>
<span id='37'>yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some</span><br/>
<span id='38'>countenance at his friend's request. An honest</span><br/>
<span id='39'>man, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave</span><br/>
<span id='40'>is not. I have served your worship truly, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>this eight years; and if I cannot once or twice in</span><br/>
<span id='42'>a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I</span><br/>
<span id='43'>have but a very little credit with your worship. The</span><br/>
<span id='44'>knave is mine honest friend, sir; therefore, I</span><br/>
<span id='45'>beseech your worship, let him be countenanced.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Go to; I say he shall have no wrong. Look about, Davy.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit DAVY</em></p>
<span id='47'>Where are you, Sir John? Come, come, come, off</span><br/>
<span id='48'>with your boots. Give me your hand, Master Bardolph.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>I am glad to see your worship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>I thank thee with all my heart, kind</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Master Bardolph: and welcome, my tall fellow.</span><br/>
<p><em>To the Page</em></p>
<span id='52'>Come, Sir John.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>I'll follow you, good Master Robert Shallow.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit SHALLOW</em></p>
<span id='54'>Bardolph, look to our horses.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt BARDOLPH and Page</em></p>
<span id='55'>If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four</span><br/>
<span id='56'>dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as Master</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the</span><br/>
<span id='58'>semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>they, by observing of him, do bear themselves like</span><br/>
<span id='60'>foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is</span><br/>
<span id='61'>turned into a justice-like serving-man: their</span><br/>
<span id='62'>spirits are so married in conjunction with the</span><br/>
<span id='63'>participation of society that they flock together in</span><br/>
<span id='64'>consent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suit</span><br/>
<span id='65'>to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the</span><br/>
<span id='66'>imputation of being near their master: if to his</span><br/>
<span id='67'>men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man</span><br/>
<span id='68'>could better command his servants. It is certain</span><br/>
<span id='69'>that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is</span><br/>
<span id='70'>caught, as men take diseases, one of another:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>therefore let men take heed of their company. I</span><br/>
<span id='72'>will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to</span><br/>
<span id='73'>keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing</span><br/>
<span id='74'>out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two</span><br/>
<span id='75'>actions, and a' shall laugh without intervallums. O,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest</span><br/>
<span id='77'>with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never</span><br/>
<span id='78'>had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him</span><br/>
<span id='79'>laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>[Within]  Sir John!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>I come, Master Shallow; I come, Master Shallow.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

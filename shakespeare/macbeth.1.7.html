<h1>Macbeth</h1>

<h3>Act I, Scene VII</h3>
<h4>Macbeth's castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Hautboys and torches. Enter a Sewer, and divers  Servants with dishes and service, and pass over the stage. Then enter MACBETH</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well</span><br/>
<span id='2'>It were done quickly: if the assassination</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Could trammel up the consequence, and catch</span><br/>
<span id='4'>With his surcease success; that but this blow</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Might be the be-all and the end-all here,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases</span><br/>
<span id='8'>We still have judgment here; that we but teach</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice</span><br/>
<span id='12'>To our own lips. He's here in double trust;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Who should against his murderer shut the door,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been</span><br/>
<span id='18'>So clear in his great office, that his virtues</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against</span><br/>
<span id='20'>The deep damnation of his taking-off;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And pity, like a naked new-born babe,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Upon the sightless couriers of the air,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur</span><br/>
<span id='26'>To prick the sides of my intent, but only</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And falls on the other.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LADY MACBETH</em></p>
<span id='29'>How now! what news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Hath he ask'd for me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Know you not he has?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>We will proceed no further in this business:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Golden opinions from all sorts of people,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Not cast aside so soon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Was the hope drunk</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And wakes it now, to look so green and pale</span><br/>
<span id='41'>At what it did so freely? From this time</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard</span><br/>
<span id='43'>To be the same in thine own act and valour</span><br/>
<span id='44'>As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And live a coward in thine own esteem,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Like the poor cat i' the adage?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Prithee, peace:</span><br/>
<span id='50'>I dare do all that may become a man;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Who dares do more is none.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>What beast was't, then,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>That made you break this enterprise to me?</span><br/>
<span id='54'>When you durst do it, then you were a man;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And, to be more than what you were, you would</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>They have made themselves, and that their fitness now</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know</span><br/>
<span id='60'>How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>I would, while it was smiling in my face,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Have done to this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>                  If we should fail?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>We fail!</span><br/>
<span id='67'>But screw your courage to the sticking-place,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Soundly invite him&mdash;his two chamberlains</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Will I with wine and wassail so convince</span><br/>
<span id='72'>That memory, the warder of the brain,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason</span><br/>
<span id='74'>A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Their drenched natures lie as in a death,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>What cannot you and I perform upon</span><br/>
<span id='77'>The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon</span><br/>
<span id='78'>His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Of our great quell?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Bring forth men-children only;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>For thy undaunted mettle should compose</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Nothing but males. Will it not be received,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>That they have done't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Who dares receive it other,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Upon his death?</span><br/>

<span id='89'>                  I am settled, and bend up</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Away, and mock the time with fairest show:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>False face must hide what the false heart doth know.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

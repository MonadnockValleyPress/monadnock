<h4>Another part of the forest.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter VALENTINE</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>How use doth breed a habit in a man!</span><br/>
<span id='2'>This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And to the nightingale's complaining notes</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Tune my distresses and record my woes.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And leave no memory of what it was!</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!</span><br/>
<span id='13'>What halloing and what stir is this to-day?</span><br/>
<span id='14'>These are my mates, that make their wills their law,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Have some unhappy passenger in chase.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>They love me well; yet I have much to do</span><br/>
<span id='17'>To keep them from uncivil outrages.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Madam, this service I have done for you,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Though you respect not aught your servant doth,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To hazard life and rescue you from him</span><br/>
<span id='22'>That would have forced your honour and your love;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>A smaller boon than this I cannot beg</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>[Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>O miserable, unhappy that I am!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But by my coming I have made you happy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>[Aside]  And me, when he approacheth to your presence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Had I been seized by a hungry lion,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>I would have been a breakfast to the beast,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And full as much, for more there cannot be,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>I do detest false perjured Proteus.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>What dangerous action, stood it next to death,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Would I not undergo for one calm look!</span><br/>
<span id='43'>O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>When women cannot love where they're beloved!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Descended into perjury, to love me.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And that's far worse than none; better have none</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Than plural faith which is too much by one:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>In love</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Who respects friend?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>All men but Proteus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Can no way change you to a milder form,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And love you 'gainst the nature of love,&mdash;force ye.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>O heaven!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>        I'll force thee yield to my desire.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Thou friend of an ill fashion!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Valentine!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>For such is a friend now; treacherous man!</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say</span><br/>
<span id='70'>I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>I am sorry I must never trust thee more,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>But count the world a stranger for thy sake.</span><br/>
<span id='75'>The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>My shame and guilt confounds me.</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Be a sufficient ransom for offence,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer</span><br/>
<span id='81'>As e'er I did commit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Then I am paid;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And once again I do receive thee honest.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Who by repentance is not satisfied</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And, that my love may appear plain and free,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>O me unhappy!</span><br/>
<p><em>Swoons</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Look to the boy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Look up; speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring</span><br/>
<span id='94'>to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Where is that ring, boy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Here 'tis; this is it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>How! let me see:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>This is the ring you sent to Silvia.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart</span><br/>
<span id='102'>I gave this unto Julia.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>And Julia herself did give it me;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And Julia herself hath brought it hither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>How! Julia!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!</span><br/>
<span id='109'>O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Such an immodest raiment, if shame live</span><br/>
<span id='112'>In a disguise of love:</span><br/>
<span id='113'>It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Women to change their shapes than men their minds.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Than men their minds! 'tis true.</span><br/>
<span id='116'>O heaven! were man</span><br/>
<span id='117'>But constant, he were perfect. That one error</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy</span><br/>
<span id='121'>More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Come, come, a hand from either:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Let me be blest to make this happy close;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>And I mine.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>Outlaws</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>A prize, a prize, a prize!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Banished Valentine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Sir Valentine!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>THURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Come not within the measure of my wrath;</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Take but possession of her with a touch:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>THURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;</span><br/>
<span id='140'>I hold him but a fool that will endanger</span><br/>
<span id='141'>His body for a girl that loves him not:</span><br/>
<span id='142'>I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>The more degenerate and base art thou,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>To make such means for her as thou hast done</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And leave her on such slight conditions.</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Now, by the honour of my ancestry,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>And think thee worthy of an empress' love:</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Know then, I here forget all former griefs,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Thou art a gentleman and well derived;</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.</span><br/>
<span id='156'>I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>These banish'd men that I have kept withal</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Are men endued with worthy qualities:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Forgive them what they have committed here</span><br/>
<span id='162'>And let them be recall'd from their exile:</span><br/>
<span id='163'>They are reformed, civil, full of good</span><br/>
<span id='164'>And fit for great employment, worthy lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee:</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Come, let us go: we will include all jars</span><br/>
<span id='168'>With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>And, as we walk along, I dare be bold</span><br/>
<span id='170'>With our discourse to make your grace to smile.</span><br/>
<span id='171'>What think you of this page, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>What mean you by that saying?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>That you will wonder what hath fortuned.</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear</span><br/>
<span id='178'>The story of your loves discovered:</span><br/>
<span id='179'>That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;</span><br/>
<span id='180'>One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h3>Act II, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Venice. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LAUNCELOT</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from</span><br/>
<span id='2'>this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and</span><br/>
<span id='3'>tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My</span><br/>
<span id='6'>conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy</span><br/>
<span id='9'>heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me</span><br/>
<span id='10'>pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the</span><br/>
<span id='11'>fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'</span><br/>
<span id='12'>says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely</span><br/>
<span id='14'>to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest</span><br/>
<span id='15'>man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>indeed, my father did something smack, something</span><br/>
<span id='17'>grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience</span><br/>
<span id='18'>says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the</span><br/>
<span id='19'>fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.</span><br/>
<span id='20'>'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'</span><br/>
<span id='21'>say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my</span><br/>
<span id='22'>conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to</span><br/>
<span id='24'>run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the</span><br/>
<span id='25'>fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil</span><br/>
<span id='26'>himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil</span><br/>
<span id='27'>incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is</span><br/>
<span id='28'>but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel</span><br/>
<span id='29'>me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more</span><br/>
<span id='30'>friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are</span><br/>
<span id='31'>at your command; I will run.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Old GOBBO, with a basket</em></p>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way</span><br/>
<span id='33'>to master Jew's?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>[Aside]  O heavens, this is my true-begotten father!</span><br/>
<span id='35'>who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>knows me not: I will try confusions with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way</span><br/>
<span id='38'>to master Jew's?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at</span><br/>
<span id='41'>the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn</span><br/>
<span id='42'>down indirectly to the Jew's house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can</span><br/>
<span id='44'>you tell me whether one Launcelot,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Talk you of young Master Launcelot?</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='47'>Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you</span><br/>
<span id='48'>of young Master Launcelot?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man</span><br/>
<span id='51'>and, God be thanked, well to live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of</span><br/>
<span id='53'>young Master Launcelot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>talk you of young Master Launcelot?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>according to Fates and Destinies and such odd</span><br/>
<span id='61'>sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of</span><br/>
<span id='62'>learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say</span><br/>
<span id='63'>in plain terms, gone to heaven.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my</span><br/>
<span id='65'>age, my very prop.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or</span><br/>
<span id='67'>a prop? Do you know me, father?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his</span><br/>
<span id='70'>soul, alive or dead?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Do you not know me, father?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of</span><br/>
<span id='74'>the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his</span><br/>
<span id='75'>own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of</span><br/>
<span id='76'>your son: give me your blessing: truth will come</span><br/>
<span id='77'>to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son</span><br/>
<span id='78'>may, but at the length truth will out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Launcelot, my boy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but</span><br/>
<span id='82'>give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy</span><br/>
<span id='83'>that was, your son that is, your child that shall</span><br/>
<span id='84'>be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>I cannot think you are my son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>I know not what I shall think of that: but I am</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your</span><br/>
<span id='88'>wife is my mother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou</span><br/>
<span id='90'>be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou</span><br/>
<span id='92'>got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows</span><br/>
<span id='95'>backward: I am sure he had more hair of his tail</span><br/>
<span id='96'>than I have of my face when I last saw him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy</span><br/>
<span id='98'>master agree? I have brought him a present. How</span><br/>
<span id='99'>'gree you now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set</span><br/>
<span id='101'>up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I</span><br/>
<span id='102'>have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give</span><br/>
<span id='103'>him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in</span><br/>
<span id='104'>his service; you may tell every finger I have with</span><br/>
<span id='105'>my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me</span><br/>
<span id='106'>your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I</span><br/>
<span id='108'>will run as far as God has any ground. O rare</span><br/>
<span id='109'>fortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for I</span><br/>
<span id='110'>am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO and other followers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper</span><br/>
<span id='112'>be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See</span><br/>
<span id='113'>these letters delivered; put the liveries to making,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit a Servant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>To him, father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>God bless your worship!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; that</span><br/>
<span id='120'>would, sir, as my father shall specify&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>and have a desire, as my father shall specify&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>are scarce cater-cousins&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having</span><br/>
<span id='127'>done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, I</span><br/>
<span id='128'>hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon</span><br/>
<span id='130'>your worship, and my suit is&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as</span><br/>
<span id='132'>your worship shall know by this honest old man; and,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>One speak for both. What would you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Serve you, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>GOBBO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>That is the very defect of the matter, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment</span><br/>
<span id='140'>To leave a rich Jew's service, to become</span><br/>
<span id='141'>The follower of so poor a gentleman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>The old proverb is very well parted between my</span><br/>
<span id='143'>master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of</span><br/>
<span id='144'>God, sir, and he hath enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Take leave of thy old master and inquire</span><br/>
<span id='147'>My lodging out. Give him a livery</span><br/>
<span id='148'>More guarded than his fellows': see it done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Father, in. I cannot get a service, no; I have</span><br/>
<span id='150'>ne'er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man in</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear</span><br/>
<span id='152'>upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifle</span><br/>
<span id='154'>of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! eleven</span><br/>
<span id='155'>widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one</span><br/>
<span id='156'>man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to be</span><br/>
<span id='157'>in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be a</span><br/>
<span id='159'>woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Launcelot and Old Gobbo</em></p>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:</span><br/>
<span id='162'>These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Return in haste, for I do feast to-night</span><br/>
<span id='164'>My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LEONARDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>My best endeavours shall be done herein.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GRATIANO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Where is your master?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>LEONARDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>Yonder, sir, he walks.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<blockquote>
<span id='170'>I have a suit to you.</span><br/>

<span id='speech54'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>You have obtain'd it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Parts that become thee happily enough</span><br/>
<span id='176'>And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;</span><br/>
<span id='177'>But where thou art not known, why, there they show</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain</span><br/>
<span id='179'>To allay with some cold drops of modesty</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior</span><br/>
<span id='181'>I be misconstrued in the place I go to,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>And lose my hopes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>                  Signior Bassanio, hear me:</span><br/>
<span id='184'>If I do not put on a sober habit,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Talk with respect and swear but now and then,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Use all the observance of civility,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Like one well studied in a sad ostent</span><br/>
<span id='191'>To please his grandam, never trust me more.</span><br/>

<span id='speech58'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Well, we shall see your bearing.</span><br/>

<span id='speech59'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge me</span><br/>
<span id='194'>By what we do to-night.</span><br/>

<span id='speech60'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>No, that were pity:</span><br/>
<span id='196'>I would entreat you rather to put on</span><br/>

<span id='198'>That purpose merriment. But fare you well:</span><br/>
<span id='199'>I have some business.</span><br/>

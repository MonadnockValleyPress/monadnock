<h1>Henry VI, Part 3</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>London. The Parliament-house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Alarum. Enter YORK, EDWARD, RICHARD, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I wonder how the king escaped our hands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>While we pursued the horsemen of the north,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>He slily stole away and left his men:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Is either slain or wounded dangerously;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>That this is true, father, behold his blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>RICHARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.</span><br/>
<p><em>Throwing down SOMERSET's head</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>RICHARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Before I see thee seated in that throne</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>This is the palace of the fearful king,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And this the regal seat: possess it, York;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>For hither we have broken in by force.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.</span><br/>
<p><em>They go up</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>And when the king comes, offer no violence,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>The queen this day here holds her parliament,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>But little thinks we shall be of her council:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>By words or blows here let us win our right.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>RICHARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Hath made us by-words to our enemies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>I mean to take possession of my right.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND, WESTMORELAND, EXETER, and the rest</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Even in the chair of state: belike he means,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge</span><br/>
<span id='56'>On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Patience is for poltroons, such as he:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>He durst not sit there, had your father lived.</span><br/>
<span id='64'>My gracious lord, here in the parliament</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Let us assail the family of York.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Ah, know you not the city favours them,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>To make a shambles of the parliament-house!</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Shall be the war that Henry means to use.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>I am thy sovereign.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>I am thine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Thy father was a traitor to the crown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown</span><br/>
<span id='82'>In following this usurping Henry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Whom should he follow but his natural king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>It must and shall be so: content thyself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget</span><br/>
<span id='91'>That we are those which chased you from the field</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And slew your fathers, and with colours spread</span><br/>
<span id='93'>March'd through the city to the palace gates.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger</span><br/>
<span id='101'>As shall revenge his death before I stir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Will you we show our title to the crown?</span><br/>
<span id='104'>If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>I am the son of Henry the Fifth,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And seized upon their towns and provinces.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>The lord protector lost it, and not I:</span><br/>
<span id='113'>When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>RICHARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>RICHARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Sons, peace!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>And be you silent and attentive too,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>For he that interrupts him shall not live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?</span><br/>
<span id='127'>No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?</span><br/>
<span id='131'>My title's good, and better far than his.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>'Twas by rebellion against his king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>[Aside]  I know not what to say; my title's weak.&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>What then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>An if he may, then am I lawful king;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>For Richard, in the view of many lords,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Whose heir my father was, and I am his.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>He rose against him, being his sovereign,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>And made him to resign his crown perforce.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>No; for he could not so resign his crown</span><br/>
<span id='147'>But that the next heir should succeed and reign.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>His is the right, and therefore pardon me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>My conscience tells me he is lawful king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>[Aside]  All will revolt from me, and turn to him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Can set the duke up in despite of me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:</span><br/>
<span id='162'>May that ground gape and swallow me alive,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.</span><br/>
<span id='166'>What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>Do right unto this princely Duke of York,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Or I will fill the house with armed men,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>And over the chair of state, where now he sits,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Write up his title with usurping blood.</span><br/>
<p><em>He stamps with his foot and the soldiers show themselves</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Let me for this my life-time reign as king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>I am content: Richard Plantagenet,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>What wrong is this unto the prince your son!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>What good is this to England and himself!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Base, fearful and despairing Henry!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>How hast thou injured both thyself and us!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>I cannot stay to hear these articles.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>Nor I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech89'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>Be thou a prey unto the house of York,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>And die in bands for this unmanly deed!</span><br/>

<span id='188'>In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='190'>Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.</span><br/>

<span id='speech92'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>

<span id='191'>They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.</span><br/>

<span id='speech93'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>

<span id='192'>Ah, Exeter!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech94'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>          Why should you sigh, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech95'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.</span><br/>
<span id='196'>But be it as it may: I here entail</span><br/>
<span id='197'>The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;</span><br/>

<span id='199'>To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,</span><br/>

<span id='201'>And neither by treason nor hostility</span><br/>

<span id='speech110'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>Who can be patient in such extremes?</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid</span><br/>
<span id='220'>And never seen thee, never borne thee son,</span><br/>
<span id='221'>Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father</span><br/>
<span id='222'>Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?</span><br/>
<span id='223'>Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,</span><br/>
<span id='224'>Or felt that pain which I did for him once,</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,</span><br/>
<span id='227'>Rather than have that savage duke thine heir</span><br/>

<span id='speech113'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='233'>Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?</span><br/>
<span id='234'>I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!</span><br/>
<span id='235'>Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;</span><br/>
<span id='236'>And given unto the house of York such head</span><br/>
<span id='237'>As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.</span><br/>
<span id='238'>To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,</span><br/>
<span id='239'>What is it, but to make thy sepulchre</span><br/>
<span id='240'>And creep into it far before thy time?</span><br/>
<span id='241'>Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;</span><br/>
<span id='242'>Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;</span><br/>
<span id='243'>The duke is made protector of the realm;</span><br/>
<span id='244'>And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds</span><br/>
<span id='245'>The trembling lamb environed with wolves.</span><br/>
<span id='246'>Had I been there, which am a silly woman,</span><br/>
<span id='247'>The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes</span><br/>
<span id='248'>Before I would have granted to that act.</span><br/>
<span id='249'>But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:</span><br/>
<span id='250'>And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself</span><br/>
<span id='251'>Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,</span><br/>
<span id='252'>Until that act of parliament be repeal'd</span><br/>
<span id='253'>Whereby my son is disinherited.</span><br/>
<span id='254'>The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours</span><br/>
<span id='255'>Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;</span><br/>
<span id='256'>And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace</span><br/>
<span id='257'>And utter ruin of the house of York.</span><br/>
<span id='258'>Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;</span><br/>
<span id='259'>Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.</span><br/>

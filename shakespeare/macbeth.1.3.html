<h1>Macbeth</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</h3>
<h4>A heath near Forres.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Thunder. Enter the three Witches</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Where hast thou been, sister?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Killing swine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Third Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Sister, where thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>'Give me,' quoth I:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>But in a sieve I'll thither sail,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And, like a rat without a tail,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Second Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>I'll give thee a wind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>First Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Thou'rt kind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Third Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>And I another.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>First Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>I myself have all the other,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And the very ports they blow,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>All the quarters that they know</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I' the shipman's card.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I will drain him dry as hay:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Sleep shall neither night nor day</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Hang upon his pent-house lid;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>He shall live a man forbid:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Weary se'nnights nine times nine</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Though his bark cannot be lost,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Yet it shall be tempest-tost.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Look what I have.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Second Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Show me, show me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>First Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Here I have a pilot's thumb,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Wreck'd as homeward he did come.</span><br/>
<p><em>Drum within</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Third Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>A drum, a drum!</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Macbeth doth come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>The weird sisters, hand in hand,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Posters of the sea and land,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Thus do go about, about:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Thrice to thine and thrice to mine</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And thrice again, to make up nine.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Peace! the charm's wound up.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MACBETH and BANQUO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>So foul and fair a day I have not seen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these</span><br/>
<span id='41'>So wither'd and so wild in their attire,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught</span><br/>
<span id='44'>That man may question? You seem to understand me,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>By each at once her chappy finger laying</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And yet your beards forbid me to interpret</span><br/>
<span id='48'>That you are so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>                  Speak, if you can: what are you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>First Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Second Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Third Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Are ye fantastical, or that indeed</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner</span><br/>
<span id='57'>You greet with present grace and great prediction</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Of noble having and of royal hope,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>If you can look into the seeds of time,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And say which grain will grow and which will not,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Your favours nor your hate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>First Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Hail!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Second Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Hail!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Third Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Hail!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>First Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Second Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Not so happy, yet much happier.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Third Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>First Witch</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>A prosperous gentleman; and to be king</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Stands not within the prospect of belief,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence</span><br/>
<span id='78'>You owe this strange intelligence? or why</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Upon this blasted heath you stop our way</span><br/>
<span id='80'>With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Witches vanish</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted</span><br/>
<span id='84'>As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Were such things here as we do speak about?</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Or have we eaten on the insane root</span><br/>
<span id='87'>That takes the reason prisoner?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Your children shall be kings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>You shall be king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ROSS and ANGUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>The king hath happily received, Macbeth,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>The news of thy success; and when he reads</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>His wonders and his praises do contend</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Strange images of death. As thick as hail</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Came post with post; and every one did bear</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And pour'd them down before him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>ANGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>We are sent</span><br/>
<span id='105'>To give thee from our royal master thanks;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Only to herald thee into his sight,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Not pay thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>And, for an earnest of a greater honour,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!</span><br/>
<span id='111'>For it is thine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>                  What, can the devil speak true?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me</span><br/>
<span id='114'>In borrow'd robes?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ANGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>                  Who was the thane lives yet;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>But under heavy judgment bears that life</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined</span><br/>
<span id='118'>With those of Norway, or did line the rebel</span><br/>
<span id='119'>With hidden help and vantage, or that with both</span><br/>
<span id='120'>He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Have overthrown him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>[Aside]  Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!</span><br/>
<span id='124'>The greatest is behind.</span><br/>
<p><em>To ROSS and ANGUS</em></p>
<span id='125'>Thanks for your pains.</span><br/>
<p><em>To BANQUO</em></p>
<span id='126'>Do you not hope your children shall be kings,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Promised no less to them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>That trusted home</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:</span><br/>
<span id='132'>And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>The instruments of darkness tell us truths,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Win us with honest trifles, to betray's</span><br/>
<span id='135'>In deepest consequence.</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Cousins, a word, I pray you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>[Aside]	Two truths are told,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>As happy prologues to the swelling act</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Of the imperial theme.&mdash;I thank you, gentlemen.</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='140'>Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Why hath it given me earnest of success,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:</span><br/>
<span id='143'>If good, why do I yield to that suggestion</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Against the use of nature? Present fears</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Are less than horrible imaginings:</span><br/>
<span id='148'>My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Shakes so my single state of man that function</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is</span><br/>
<span id='151'>But what is not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>                  Look, how our partner's rapt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>[Aside]  If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Without my stir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>                  New horrors come upon him,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould</span><br/>
<span id='157'>But with the aid of use.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>[Aside]                Come what come may,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought</span><br/>
<span id='162'>With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Are register'd where every day I turn</span><br/>
<span id='164'>The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Our free hearts each to other.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>

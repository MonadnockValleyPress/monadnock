<h1>Cymbeline</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene V</h3>
<h4>Britain. A room in Cymbeline's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter QUEEN, Ladies, and CORNELIUS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Make haste: who has the note of them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>I, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Dispatch.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Ladies</em></p>
<span id='5'>Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CORNELIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:</span><br/>
<p><em>Presenting a small box</em></p>
<span id='7'>But I beseech your grace, without offence,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>My conscience bids me ask&mdash;wherefore you have</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Which are the movers of a languishing death;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>But though slow, deadly?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>I wonder, doctor,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how</span><br/>
<span id='15'>To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so</span><br/>
<span id='16'>That our great king himself doth woo me oft</span><br/>
<span id='17'>For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Unless thou think'st me devilish&mdash;is't not meet</span><br/>
<span id='19'>That I did amplify my judgment in</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Other conclusions? I will try the forces</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Of these thy compounds on such creatures as</span><br/>
<span id='22'>We count not worth the hanging, but none human,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To try the vigour of them and apply</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Allayments to their act, and by them gather</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Their several virtues and effects.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CORNELIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Your highness</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Shall from this practise but make hard your heart:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Besides, the seeing these effects will be</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Both noisome and infectious.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>O, content thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PISANIO</em></p>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='31'>Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Will I first work: he's for his master,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Doctor, your service for this time is ended;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Take your own way.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CORNELIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>[Aside]          I do suspect you, madam;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>But you shall do no harm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>[To PISANIO]            Hark thee, a word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CORNELIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>[Aside]  I do not like her. She doth think she has</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And will not trust one of her malice with</span><br/>
<span id='42'>A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Which first, perchance, she'll prove on</span><br/>
<span id='45'>cats and dogs,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Then afterward up higher: but there is</span><br/>
<span id='47'>No danger in what show of death it makes,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>More than the locking-up the spirits a time,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd</span><br/>
<span id='50'>With a most false effect; and I the truer,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>So to be false with her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>No further service, doctor,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Until I send for thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CORNELIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>I humbly take my leave.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time</span><br/>
<span id='56'>She will not quench and let instructions enter</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then</span><br/>
<span id='60'>As great as is thy master, greater, for</span><br/>
<span id='61'>His fortunes all lie speechless and his name</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Continue where he is: to shift his being</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Is to exchange one misery with another,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And every day that comes comes to decay</span><br/>
<span id='66'>A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>To be depender on a thing that leans,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>So much as but to prop him?</span><br/>
<p><em>The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up</em></p>
<span id='70'>Thou takest up</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>It is a thing I made, which hath the king</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know</span><br/>
<span id='74'>What is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>It is an earnest of a further good</span><br/>
<span id='76'>That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how</span><br/>
<span id='77'>The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Think what a chance thou changest on, but think</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king</span><br/>
<span id='81'>To any shape of thy preferment such</span><br/>
<span id='82'>As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>That set thee on to this desert, am bound</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To load thy merit richly. Call my women:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Think on my words.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit PISANIO</em></p>
<span id='86'>A sly and constant knave,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Not to be shaked; the agent for his master</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And the remembrancer of her to hold</span><br/>
<span id='89'>The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Except she bend her humour, shall be assured</span><br/>
<span id='93'>To taste of too.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter PISANIO and Ladies</em></p>
<span id='94'>So, so: well done, well done:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Think on my words.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>And shall do:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>But when to my good lord I prove untrue,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

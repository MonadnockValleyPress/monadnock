<h1>Titus Andronicus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Court of Titus's house. A banquet set out.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LUCIUS, MARCUS, and Goths, with AARON prisoner</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Uncle Marcus, since it is my father's mind</span><br/>
<span id='2'>That I repair to Rome, I am content.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Goth</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Till he be brought unto the empress' face,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>For testimony of her foul proceedings:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And see the ambush of our friends be strong;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>I fear the emperor means no good to us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The venomous malice of my swelling heart!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Away, inhuman dog! unhallow'd slave!</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Goths, with AARON. Flourish within</em></p>
<span id='16'>The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SATURNINUS and TAMORA, with AEMILIUS, Tribunes, Senators, and others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>What, hath the firmament more suns than one?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Rome's emperor, and nephew, break the parle;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>These quarrels must be quietly debated.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>The feast is ready, which the careful Titus</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Hath ordain'd to an honourable end,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Please you, therefore, draw nigh, and take your places.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Marcus, we will.</span><br/>
<p><em>Hautboys sound. The Company sit down at table</em></p>
<p><em>Enter TITUS dressed like a Cook, LAVINIA veiled,  Young LUCIUS, and others. TITUS places the dishes on the table</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread queen;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Welcome, ye warlike Goths; welcome, Lucius;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And welcome, all: although the cheer be poor,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Because I would be sure to have all well,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>To entertain your highness and your empress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>An if your highness knew my heart, you were.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>My lord the emperor, resolve me this:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Was it well done of rash Virginius</span><br/>
<span id='37'>To slay his daughter with his own right hand,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Because she was enforced, stain'd, and deflower'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>It was, Andronicus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Your reason, mighty lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Because the girl should not survive her shame,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And by her presence still renew his sorrows.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>For me, most wretched, to perform the like.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;</span><br/>
<p><em>Kills LAVINIA</em></p>
<span id='47'>And, with thy shame, thy father's sorrow die!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>I am as woful as Virginius was,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And have a thousand times more cause than he</span><br/>
<span id='52'>To do this outrage: and it now is done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>What, was she ravish'd? tell who did the deed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Will't please you eat? will't please your</span><br/>
<span id='55'>highness feed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>They ravish'd her, and cut away her tongue;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Go fetch them hither to us presently.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Why, there they are both, baked in that pie;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.</span><br/>
<span id='64'>'Tis true, 'tis true; witness my knife's sharp point.</span><br/>
<p><em>Kills TAMORA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!</span><br/>
<p><em>Kills TITUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?</span><br/>
<span id='67'>There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!</span><br/>
<p><em>Kills SATURNINUS. A great tumult. LUCIUS, MARCUS, and others go up into the balcony</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>O, let me teach you how to knit again</span><br/>
<span id='72'>This scatter'd corn  into one mutual sheaf,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>These broken limbs again into one body;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Do shameful execution on herself.</span><br/>
<span id='78'>But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Grave witnesses of true experience,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Cannot induce you to attend my words,</span><br/>
<p><em>To LUCIUS</em></p>
<span id='81'>Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>When with his solemn tongue he did discourse</span><br/>
<span id='83'>To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear</span><br/>
<span id='84'>The story of that baleful burning night</span><br/>
<span id='85'>When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Or who hath brought the fatal engine in</span><br/>
<span id='88'>That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>But floods of tears will drown my oratory,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And break my utterance, even in the time</span><br/>
<span id='93'>When it should move you to attend me most,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Lending your kind commiseration.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>That cursed Chiron and Demetrius</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And they it were that ravished our sister:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Our father's tears despised, and basely cozen'd</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And sent her enemies unto the grave.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Lastly, myself unkindly banished,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>To beg relief among Rome's enemies:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears.</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.</span><br/>
<span id='110'>I am the turned forth, be it known to you,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>That have preserved her welfare in my blood;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And from her bosom took the enemy's point,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>My scars can witness, dumb although they are,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>That my report is just and full of truth.</span><br/>
<span id='117'>But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.</span><br/>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>

<span id='120'>Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:</span><br/>
<p><em>Pointing to the Child in the arms of an Attendant</em></p>
<span id='121'>Of this was Tamora delivered;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>The issue of an irreligious Moor,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Chief architect and plotter of these woes:</span><br/>
<span id='124'>The villain is alive in Titus' house,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And as he is, to witness this is true.</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge</span><br/>
<span id='127'>These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Or more than any living man could bear.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Have we done aught amiss,&mdash;show us wherein,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And, from the place where you behold us now,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>The poor remainder of Andronici</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down.</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And make a mutual closure of our house.</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.</span><br/>

<span id='139'>And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,</span><br/>

<span id='148'>Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe!</span><br/>
<span id='150'>But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>For nature puts me to a heavy task:</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.</span><br/>
<span id='154'>O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,</span><br/>
<p><em>Kissing TITUS</em></p>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us</span><br/>
<span id='162'>To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Many a time he danced thee on his knee,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Many a matter hath he told to thee,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>In that respect, then, like a loving child,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Because kind nature doth require it so:</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.</span><br/>

<span id='175'>O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;</span><br/>
<span id='176'>My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.</span><br/>

<span id='186'>I am no baby, I, that with base prayers</span><br/>
<span id='187'>I should repent the evils I have done:</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did</span><br/>

<span id='201'>And, being so, shall have like want of pity.</span><br/>
<span id='202'>See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Then, afterwards, to order well the state,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>That like events may ne'er it ruinate.</span><br/>

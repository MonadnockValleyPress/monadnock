<h1>Coriolanus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene IX</h3>
<h4>The Roman camp.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Flourish. Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Flourish.  Enter, from one side, COMINIUS with the Romans; from the other side, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarf</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the</span><br/>
<span id='7'>dull tribunes,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Our Rome hath such a soldier.'</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Having fully dined before.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power, from the pursuit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LARTIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>O general,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Here is the steed, we the caparison:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Hadst thou beheld&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Pray now, no more: my mother,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Who has a charter to extol her blood,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>When she does praise me grieves me. I have done</span><br/>
<span id='19'>As you have done; that's what I can; induced</span><br/>
<span id='20'>As you have been; that's for my country:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>He that has but effected his good will</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Hath overta'en mine act.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>You shall not be</span><br/>
<span id='24'>The grave of your deserving; Rome must know</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The value of her own: 'twere a concealment</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>To hide your doings; and to silence that,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you</span><br/>
<span id='30'>In sign of what you are, not to reward</span><br/>
<span id='31'>What you have done&mdash;before our army hear me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I have some wounds upon me, and they smart</span><br/>
<span id='33'>To hear themselves remember'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Should they not,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all</span><br/>
<span id='38'>The treasure in this field achieved and city,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Before the common distribution, at</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Your only choice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>                  I thank you, general;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>But cannot make my heart consent to take</span><br/>
<span id='44'>A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And stand upon my common part with those</span><br/>
<span id='46'>That have beheld the doing.</span><br/>
<p><em>A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius! Marcius!'  cast up their caps and lances: COMINIUS and LARTIUS stand bare</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>May these same instruments, which you profane,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall</span><br/>
<span id='49'>I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Made all of false-faced soothing!</span><br/>
<span id='51'>When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Let him be made a coverture for the wars!</span><br/>
<span id='53'>No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd</span><br/>
<span id='54'>My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Which, without note, here's many else have done,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>You shout me forth</span><br/>
<span id='57'>In acclamations hyperbolical;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>As if I loved my little should be dieted</span><br/>
<span id='59'>In praises sauced with lies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Too modest are you;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>More cruel to your good report than grateful</span><br/>
<span id='62'>To us that give you truly: by your patience,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>With all his trim belonging; and from this time,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>For what he did before Corioli, call him,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>With all the applause and clamour of the host,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear</span><br/>
<span id='73'>The addition nobly ever!</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Caius Marcius Coriolanus!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>I will go wash;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And when my face is fair, you shall perceive</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.</span><br/>
<span id='78'>I mean to stride your steed, and at all times</span><br/>
<span id='79'>To undercrest your good addition</span><br/>
<span id='80'>To the fairness of my power.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>So, to our tent;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Where, ere we do repose us, we will write</span><br/>
<span id='83'>To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome</span><br/>
<span id='85'>The best, with whom we may articulate,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>For their own good and ours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LARTIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>I shall, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>The gods begin to mock me. I, that now</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Of my lord general.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>I sometime lay here in Corioli</span><br/>
<span id='93'>At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>But then Aufidius was within my view,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you</span><br/>
<span id='97'>To give my poor host freedom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>O, well begg'd!</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Were he the butcher of my son, he should</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LARTIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Marcius, his name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>                  By Jupiter! forgot.</span><br/>
<span id='103'>I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Have we no wine here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Go we to our tent:</span><br/>
<span id='106'>The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time</span><br/>
<span id='107'>It should be look'd to: come.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

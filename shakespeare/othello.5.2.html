<h1>Othello</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene II</h3>
<h4>A bedchamber in the castle: Desdemona in bed asleep; a light burning.</h4>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter OTHELLO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And smooth as monumental alabaster.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Put out the light, and then put out the light:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>I can again thy former light restore,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>I know not where is that Promethean heat</span><br/>
<span id='13'>That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>I cannot give it vital growth again.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.</span><br/>
<p><em>Kissing her</em></p>
<span id='16'>Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And love thee after. One more, and this the last:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Who's there? Othello?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Ay. Desdemona.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Will you come to bed, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Ay, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>If you bethink yourself of any crime</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Solicit for it straight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Talk you of killing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Ay, I do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Then heaven</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Have mercy on me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>                  Amen, with all my heart!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Hum!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then</span><br/>
<span id='43'>When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Think on thy sins.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>                  They are loves I bear to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Ay, and for that thou diest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>That death's unnatural that kills for loving.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>They do not point on me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Peace, and be still!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>I will so. What's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Thou gavest to Cassio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>No, by my life and soul!</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Send for the man, and ask him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Sweet soul, take heed,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Ay, but not yet to die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Yes, presently:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>For to deny each article with oath</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception</span><br/>
<span id='66'>That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Then Lord have mercy on me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>I say, amen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>And have you mercy too! I never did</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio</span><br/>
<span id='72'>But with such general warranty of heaven</span><br/>
<span id='73'>As I might love: I never gave him token.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand.</span><br/>
<span id='75'>O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And makest me call what I intend to do</span><br/>
<span id='77'>A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>I saw the handkerchief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>He found it then;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I never gave it him: send for him hither;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Let him confess a truth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>He hath confess'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>What, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>That he hath used thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>How? unlawfully?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Ay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>He will not say so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>No, his mouth is stopp'd;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Had stomach for them all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='95'>O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Down, strumpet!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Nay, if you strive&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>

<span id='99'>But half an hour!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>

<span id='speech50'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>

<span id='104'>What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?</span><br/>

<span id='106'>I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So, so.</span><br/>

<span id='110'>Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>I think she stirs again:&mdash;no. What's best to do?</span><br/>
<span id='115'>If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:</span><br/>
<span id='116'>My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.</span><br/>
<span id='117'>O insupportable! O heavy hour!</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse</span><br/>

<span id='163'>Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.</span><br/>

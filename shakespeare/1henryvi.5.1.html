<h1>Henry VI, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>London. The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, and EXETER</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Have you perused the letters from the pope,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The emperor and the Earl of Armagnac?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>I have, my lord: and their intent is this:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>They humbly sue unto your excellence</span><br/>
<span id='5'>To have a godly peace concluded of</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Between the realms of England and of France.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>How doth your grace affect their motion?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Well, my good lord; and as the only means</span><br/>
<span id='9'>To stop effusion of our Christian blood</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And 'stablish quietness on every side.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Ay, marry, uncle; for I always thought</span><br/>
<span id='12'>It was both impious and unnatural</span><br/>
<span id='13'>That such immanity and bloody strife</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Should reign among professors of one faith.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Beside, my lord, the sooner to effect</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And surer bind this knot of amity,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>The Earl of Armagnac, near knit to Charles,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>A man of great authority in France,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Proffers his only daughter to your grace</span><br/>
<span id='20'>In marriage, with a large and sumptuous dowry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And fitter is my study and my books</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Than wanton dalliance with a paramour.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Yet call the ambassador; and, as you please,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>So let them have their answers every one:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>I shall be well content with any choice</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Tends to God's glory and my country's weal.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER in Cardinal's habit, a Legate and two Ambassadors</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>EXETER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>What! is my Lord of Winchester install'd,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And call'd unto a cardinal's degree?</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Then I perceive that will be verified</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>'If once he come to be a cardinal,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>He'll make his cap co-equal with the crown.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>My lords ambassadors, your several suits</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Have been consider'd and debated on.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And therefore are we certainly resolved</span><br/>
<span id='37'>To draw conditions of a friendly peace;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Shall be transported presently to France.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>And for the proffer of my lord your master,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>I have inform'd his highness so at large</span><br/>
<span id='42'>As liking of the lady's virtuous gifts,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Her beauty and the value of her dower,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>He doth intend she shall be England's queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>In argument and proof of which contract,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Bear her this jewel, pledge of my affection.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And so, my lord protector, see them guarded</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And safely brought to Dover; where inshipp'd</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Commit them to the fortune of the sea.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER and Legate</em></p>
<span id='50'>CARDINAL</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>OF WINCHESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Stay, my lord legate: you shall first receive</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The sum of money which I promised</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Should be deliver'd to his holiness</span><br/>
<span id='54'>For clothing me in these grave ornaments.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Legate</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>I will attend upon your lordship's leisure.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>CARDINAL</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>OF WINCHESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>[Aside]  Now Winchester will not submit, I trow,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Or be inferior to the proudest peer.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Humphrey of Gloucester, thou shalt well perceive</span><br/>
<span id='60'>That, neither in birth or for authority,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>The bishop will be overborne by thee:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>I'll either make thee stoop and bend thy knee,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Or sack this country with a mutiny.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

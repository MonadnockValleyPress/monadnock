<h1>Hamlet</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene III</h3>
<h4>A room in the castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I like him not, nor stands it safe with us</span><br/>
<span id='2'>To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>I your commission will forthwith dispatch,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And he to England shall along with you:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>The terms of our estate may not endure</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Out of his lunacies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>We will ourselves provide:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Most holy and religious fear it is</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To keep those many many bodies safe</span><br/>
<span id='11'>That live and feed upon your majesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>The single and peculiar life is bound,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>With all the strength and armour of the mind,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>To keep itself from noyance; but much more</span><br/>
<span id='15'>That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The lives of many. The cease of majesty</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw</span><br/>
<span id='18'>What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Each small annexment, petty consequence,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>For we will fetters put upon this fear,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Which now goes too free-footed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong></span>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>We will haste us.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</em></p>
<p><em>Enter POLONIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Behind the arras I'll convey myself,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And, as you said, and wisely was it said,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear</span><br/>
<span id='35'>The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And tell you what I know.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Thanks, dear my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit POLONIUS</em></p>
<span id='39'>O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>A brother's murder. Pray can I not,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Though inclination be as sharp as will:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And, like a man to double business bound,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>I stand in pause where I shall first begin,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And both neglect. What if this cursed hand</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens</span><br/>
<span id='49'>To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy</span><br/>
<span id='50'>But to confront the visage of offence?</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>To be forestalled ere we come to fall,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?</span><br/>
<span id='56'>That cannot be; since I am still possess'd</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Of those effects for which I did the murder,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?</span><br/>
<span id='60'>In the corrupted currents of this world</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>There is no shuffling, there the action lies</span><br/>
<span id='65'>In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>To give in evidence. What then? what rests?</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Try what repentance can: what can it not?</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Yet what can it when one can not repent?</span><br/>
<span id='70'>O wretched state! O bosom black as death!</span><br/>
<span id='71'>O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!</span><br/>
<span id='75'>All may be well.</span><br/>
<p><em>Retires and kneels</em></p>
<p><em>Enter HAMLET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>A villain kills my father; and for that,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I, his sole son, do this same villain send</span><br/>
<span id='81'>To heaven.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>He took my father grossly, full of bread;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?</span><br/>
<span id='86'>But in our circumstance and course of thought,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>To take him in the purging of his soul,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>When he is fit and season'd for his passage?</span><br/>
<span id='90'>No!</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>At gaming, swearing, or about some act</span><br/>
<span id='95'>That has no relish of salvation in't;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And that his soul may be as damn'd and black</span><br/>
<span id='98'>As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>[Rising]  My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Words without thoughts never to heaven go.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<h1>Coriolanus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Rome. A public place.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS, BRUTUS, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Which was sometime his general; who loved him</span><br/>
<span id='3'>In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>A mile before his tent fall down, and knee</span><br/>
<span id='6'>The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd</span><br/>
<span id='7'>To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>He would not seem to know me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Do you hear?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Yet one time he did call me by my name:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops</span><br/>
<span id='12'>That we have bled together. Coriolanus</span><br/>
<span id='13'>He would not answer to: forbad all names;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>He was a kind of nothing, titleless,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Of burning Rome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Why, so: you have made good work!</span><br/>
<span id='18'>A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>To make coals cheap,&mdash;a noble memory!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon</span><br/>
<span id='21'>When it was less expected: he replied,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>It was a bare petition of a state</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To one whom they had punish'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Very well:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Could he say less?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>I offer'd to awaken his regard</span><br/>
<span id='27'>For's private friends: his answer to me was,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>He could not stay to pick them in a pile</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And still to nose the offence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>For one poor grain or two!</span><br/>
<span id='33'>I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid</span><br/>
<span id='38'>In this so never-needed help, yet do not</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>More than the instant army we can make,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Might stop our countryman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>No, I'll not meddle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Pray you, go to him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>What should I do?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Only make trial what your love can do</span><br/>
<span id='47'>For Rome, towards Marcius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Well, and say that Marcius</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Return me, as Cominius is return'd,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Unheard; what then?</span><br/>
<span id='51'>But as a discontented friend, grief-shot</span><br/>
<span id='52'>With his unkindness? say't be so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Yet your good will</span><br/>
<span id='54'>must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure</span><br/>
<span id='55'>As you intended well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>I'll undertake 't:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>He was not taken well; he had not dined:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then</span><br/>
<span id='61'>We pout upon the morning, are unapt</span><br/>
<span id='62'>To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd</span><br/>
<span id='63'>These and these conveyances of our blood</span><br/>
<span id='64'>With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Till he be dieted to my request,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And then I'll set upon him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>You know the very road into his kindness,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And cannot lose your way.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Good faith, I'll prove him,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Of my success.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>                  He'll never hear him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury</span><br/>
<span id='77'>The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>He sent in writing after me; what he would not,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>So that all hope is vain.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Unless his noble mother, and his wife;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him</span><br/>
<span id='85'>For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And with our fair entreaties haste them on.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h3>Act III, Scene V</H3>
<h4>Another part of the forest.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Say that you love me not, but say not so</span><br/>
<span id='3'>In bitterness. The common executioner,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck</span><br/>
<span id='6'>But first begs pardon: will you sterner be</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PHEBE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>I would not be thy executioner:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Who shut their coward gates on atomies,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>The cicatrice and capable impressure</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes</span><br/>
<span id='27'>That can do hurt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>                  O dear Phebe,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>If ever,&mdash;as that ever may be near,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Then shall you know the wounds invisible</span><br/>
<span id='32'>That love's keen arrows make.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PHEBE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>But till that time</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>As till that time I shall not pity thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>That you insult, exult, and all at once,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>As, by my faith, I see no more in you</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Than without candle may go dark to bed&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?</span><br/>
<span id='44'>I see no more in you than in the ordinary</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>I think she means to tangle my eyes too!</span><br/>
<span id='47'>No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>That can entame my spirits to your worship.</span><br/>
<span id='51'>You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?</span><br/>
<span id='53'>You are a thousand times a properer man</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you</span><br/>
<span id='55'>That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And out of you she sees herself more proper</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Than any of her lineaments can show her.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>For I must tell you friendly in your ear,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PHEBE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll</span><br/>
<span id='69'>fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as</span><br/>
<span id='70'>she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her</span><br/>
<span id='71'>with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PHEBE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>For no ill will I bear you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>I pray you, do not fall in love with me,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>For I am falser than vows made in wine:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>And be not proud: though all the world could see,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>None could be so abused in sight as he.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Come, to our flock.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORIN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PHEBE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Sweet Phebe,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PHEBE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>                  Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Sweet Phebe, pity me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PHEBE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>If you do sorrow at my grief in love,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>By giving love your sorrow and my grief</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Were both extermined.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PHEBE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>I would have you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PHEBE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>                  Why, that were covetousness.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And yet it is not that I bear thee love;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>But since that thou canst talk of love so well,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>But do not look for further recompense</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>So holy and so perfect is my love,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And I in such a poverty of grace,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>That I shall think it a most plenteous crop</span><br/>
<span id='105'>To glean the broken ears after the man</span><br/>
<span id='106'>That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then</span><br/>
<span id='107'>A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PHEBE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Not very well, but I have met him oft;</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds</span><br/>
<span id='111'>That the old carlot once was master of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PHEBE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Think not I love him, though I ask for him:</span><br/>
<span id='113'>'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>But what care I for words? yet words do well</span><br/>
<span id='115'>When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.</span><br/>
<span id='116'>It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:</span><br/>
<span id='118'>He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Did make offence his eye did heal it up.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>There was a pretty redness in his lip,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>A little riper and more lusty red</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Between the constant red and mingled damask.</span><br/>
<span id='127'>There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him</span><br/>
<span id='128'>In parcels as I did, would have gone near</span><br/>
<span id='129'>To fall in love with him; but, for my part,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>I love him not nor hate him not; and yet</span><br/>
<span id='131'>I have more cause to hate him than to love him:</span><br/>
<span id='132'>For what had he to do to chide at me?</span><br/>
<span id='133'>He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>I marvel why I answer'd not again:</span><br/>
<span id='136'>But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.</span><br/>
<span id='137'>I'll write to him a very taunting letter,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Phebe, with all my heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PHEBE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>I'll write it straight;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>The matter's in my head and in my heart:</span><br/>
<span id='142'>I will be bitter with him and passing short.</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Go with me, Silvius.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

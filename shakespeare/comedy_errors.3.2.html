<em>Enter LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>And may it be that you have quite forgot</span><br/>
<span id='2'>A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?</span><br/>
<span id='5'>If you did wed my sister for her wealth,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Let not my sister read it in your eye;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?</span><br/>
<span id='16'>What simple thief brags of his own attaint?</span><br/>
<span id='17'>'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And let her read it in thy looks at board:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Alas, poor women! make us but believe,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Being compact of credit, that you love us;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>We in your motion turn and you may move us.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Then, gentle brother, get you in again;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Sweet mistress&mdash;what your name is else, I know not,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>The folded meaning of your words' deceit.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Against my soul's pure truth why labour you</span><br/>
<span id='38'>To make it wander in an unknown field?</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Are you a god? would you create me new?</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>But if that I am I, then well I know</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Nor to her bed no homage do I owe</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Far more, far more to you do I decline.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And in that glorious supposition think</span><br/>
<span id='51'>He gains by death that hath such means to die:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>What, are you mad, that you do reason so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>It is a fault that springeth from your eye.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Why call you me love? call my sister so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Thy sister's sister.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>That's my sister.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>No;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>It is thyself, mine own self's better part,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>All this my sister is, or else should be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Give me thy hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>                  O, soft, air! hold you still:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter DROMIO of Syracuse</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?</span><br/>
<span id='76'>am I myself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>What woman's man? and how besides thyself? besides thyself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one</span><br/>
<span id='81'>that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>What claim lays she to thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your</span><br/>
<span id='84'>horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I</span><br/>
<span id='85'>being a beast, she would have me; but that she,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>What is she?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may</span><br/>
<span id='89'>not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have</span><br/>
<span id='90'>but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a</span><br/>
<span id='91'>wondrous fat marriage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>How dost thou mean a fat marriage?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>and I know not what use to put her to but to make a</span><br/>
<span id='95'>lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I</span><br/>
<span id='96'>warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>What complexion is she of?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so</span><br/>
<span id='101'>clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over</span><br/>
<span id='102'>shoes in the grime of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>That's a fault that water will mend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>What's her name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that's</span><br/>
<span id='107'>an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from</span><br/>
<span id='108'>hip to hip.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Then she bears some breadth?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:</span><br/>
<span id='111'>she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out</span><br/>
<span id='112'>countries in her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>In what part of her body stands Ireland?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Where Scotland?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Where France?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war</span><br/>
<span id='119'>against her heir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Where England?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no</span><br/>
<span id='122'>whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Where Spain?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Where America, the Indies?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with</span><br/>
<span id='128'>rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich</span><br/>
<span id='129'>aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole</span><br/>
<span id='130'>armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this</span><br/>
<span id='133'>drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what</span><br/>
<span id='135'>privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my</span><br/>
<span id='136'>shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my</span><br/>
<span id='137'>left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>And, I think, if my breast had not been made of</span><br/>
<span id='139'>faith and my heart of steel,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made</span><br/>
<span id='141'>me turn i' the wheel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Go hie thee presently, post to the road:</span><br/>
<span id='143'>An if the wind blow any way from shore,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>I will not harbour in this town to-night:</span><br/>
<span id='145'>If any bark put forth, come to the mart,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Where I will walk till thou return to me.</span><br/>
<span id='151'>If every one knows us and we know none,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>As from a bear a man would run for life,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>So fly I from her that would be my wife.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>There's none but witches do inhabit here;</span><br/>
<span id='156'>And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.</span><br/>
<span id='157'>She that doth call me husband, even my soul</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Of such enchanting presence and discourse,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Hath almost made me traitor to myself:</span><br/>
<span id='162'>But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ANGELO with the chain</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Master Antipholus,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Ay, that's my name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.</span><br/>
<span id='167'>I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:</span><br/>
<span id='168'>The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>What is your will that I shall do with this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Go home with it and please your wife withal;</span><br/>
<span id='173'>And soon at supper-time I'll visit you</span><br/>
<span id='174'>And then receive my money for the chain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>I pray you, sir, receive the money now,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<span id='speech62'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>

<span id='178'>What I should think of this, I cannot tell:</span><br/>
<span id='179'>But this I think, there's no man is so vain</span><br/>
<span id='180'>That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.</span><br/>
<span id='181'>I see a man here needs not live by shifts,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.</span><br/>
<span id='183'>I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay</span><br/>
<span id='184'>If any ship put out, then straight away.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

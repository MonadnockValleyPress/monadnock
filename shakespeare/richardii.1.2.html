<h4>The Duke of Lancaster's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter JOHN OF GAUNT with DUCHESS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>To stir against the butchers of his life!</span><br/>
<span id='4'>But since correction lieth in those hands</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Which made the fault that we cannot correct,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Or seven fair branches springing from one root:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>One flourishing branch of his most royal root,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent</span><br/>
<span id='26'>In some large measure to thy father's death,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Who was the model of thy father's life.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>That which in mean men we intitle patience</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>His deputy anointed in His sight,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift</span><br/>
<span id='41'>An angry arm against His minister.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Where then, alas, may I complain myself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>To God, the widow's champion and defence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Or, if misfortune miss the first career,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>They may break his foaming courser's back,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And throw the rider headlong in the lists,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife</span><br/>
<span id='55'>With her companion grief must end her life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>As much good stay with thee as go with me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>I take my leave before I have begun,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Lo, this is all:&mdash;nay, yet depart not so;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Though this be all, do not so quickly go;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>I shall remember more. Bid him&mdash;ah, what?&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>With all good speed at Plashy visit me.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Alack, and what shall good old York there see</span><br/>
<span id='68'>But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And what hear there for welcome but my groans?</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Therefore commend me; let him not come there,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

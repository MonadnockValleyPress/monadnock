<h1>As You Like It</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene III</H3>
<h4>The forest.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ROSALIND and CELIA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? and</span><br/>
<span id='2'>here much Orlando!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he</span><br/>
<span id='4'>hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to</span><br/>
<span id='5'>sleep. Look, who comes here.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SILVIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>My errand is to you, fair youth;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>I know not the contents; but, as I guess</span><br/>
<span id='9'>By the stern brow and waspish action</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Which she did use as she was writing of it,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>I am but as a guiltless messenger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Patience herself would startle at this letter</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>This is a letter of your own device.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>No, I protest, I know not the contents:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Phebe did write it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Come, come, you are a fool</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And turn'd into the extremity of love.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think</span><br/>
<span id='27'>That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>I say she never did invent this letter;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>This is a man's invention and his hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Sure, it is hers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>So please you, for I never heard it yet;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='41'>Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Can a woman rail thus?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Call you this railing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>[Reads]</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Why, thy godhead laid apart,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Did you ever hear such railing?</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Whiles the eye of man did woo me,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>That could do no vengeance to me.</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Meaning me a beast.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>If the scorn of your bright eyne</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Have power to raise such love in mine,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Alack, in me what strange effect</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Would they work in mild aspect!</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Whiles you chid me, I did love;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>How then might your prayers move!</span><br/>
<span id='58'>He that brings this love to thee</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Little knows this love in me:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And by him seal up thy mind;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Whether that thy youth and kind</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Will the faithful offer take</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Of me and all that I can make;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Or else by him my love deny,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And then I'll study how to die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SILVIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Call you this chiding?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Alas, poor shepherd!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt</span><br/>
<span id='69'>thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an</span><br/>
<span id='70'>instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to</span><br/>
<span id='71'>be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see</span><br/>
<span id='72'>love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to</span><br/>
<span id='73'>her: that if she love me, I charge her to love</span><br/>
<span id='74'>thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless</span><br/>
<span id='75'>thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit SILVIUS</em></p>
<p><em>Enter OLIVER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Where in the purlieus of this forest stands</span><br/>
<span id='79'>A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:</span><br/>
<span id='81'>The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Left on your right hand brings you to the place.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>But at this hour the house doth keep itself;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>There's none within.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>If that an eye may profit by a tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Then should I know you by description;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Of female favour, and bestows himself</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Like a ripe sister: the woman low</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And browner than her brother.' Are not you</span><br/>
<span id='91'>The owner of the house I did inquire for?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Orlando doth commend him to you both,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And to that youth he calls his Rosalind</span><br/>
<span id='95'>He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>I am: what must we understand by this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Some of my shame; if you will know of me</span><br/>
<span id='98'>What man I am, and how, and why, and where</span><br/>
<span id='99'>This handkercher was stain'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>I pray you, tell it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>When last the young Orlando parted from you</span><br/>
<span id='102'>He left a promise to return again</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And mark what object did present itself:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And high top bald with dry antiquity,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck</span><br/>
<span id='111'>A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd</span><br/>
<span id='113'>The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And with indented glides did slip away</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Into a bush: under which bush's shade</span><br/>
<span id='117'>A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis</span><br/>
<span id='120'>The royal disposition of that beast</span><br/>
<span id='121'>To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>This seen, Orlando did approach the man</span><br/>
<span id='123'>And found it was his brother, his elder brother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And he did render him the most unnatural</span><br/>
<span id='126'>That lived amongst men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>And well he might so do,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>For well I know he was unnatural.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And nature, stronger than his just occasion,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Made him give battle to the lioness,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling</span><br/>
<span id='136'>From miserable slumber I awaked.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Are you his brother?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Wast you he rescued?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>'Twas I; but 'tis not I: I do not shame</span><br/>
<span id='141'>To tell you what I was, since my conversion</span><br/>
<span id='142'>So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>But, for the bloody napkin?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>By and by.</span><br/>
<span id='145'>When from the first to last betwixt us two</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>As how I came into that desert place:&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='148'>In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Committing me unto my brother's love;</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Who led me instantly unto his cave,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm</span><br/>
<span id='153'>The lioness had torn some flesh away,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted</span><br/>
<span id='155'>And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>And, after some small space, being strong at heart,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>He sent me hither, stranger as I am,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>To tell this story, that you might excuse</span><br/>
<span id='160'>His broken promise, and to give this napkin</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth</span><br/>
<span id='162'>That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.</span><br/>
<p><em>ROSALIND swoons</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Many will swoon when they do look on blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Look, he recovers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>I would I were at home.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>We'll lead you thither.</span><br/>
<span id='169'>I pray you, will you take him by the arm?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>Be of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack a</span><br/>
<span id='171'>man's heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would</span><br/>
<span id='173'>think this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tell</span><br/>
<span id='174'>your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>This was not counterfeit: there is too great</span><br/>
<span id='176'>testimony in your complexion that it was a passion</span><br/>
<span id='177'>of earnest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>Counterfeit, I assure you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>So I do: but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>Come, you look paler and paler: pray you, draw</span><br/>
<span id='182'>homewards. Good sir, go with us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>That will I, for I must bear answer back</span><br/>
<span id='184'>How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>I shall devise something: but, I pray you, commend</span><br/>
<span id='186'>my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

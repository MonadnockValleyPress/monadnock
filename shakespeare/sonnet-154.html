<h1>Sonnet CLIV</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>

<h3>CLIV</h3>
<p>
The little Love-god lying once asleep,<br/>
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,<br/>
Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep<br/>
Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand<br/>
The fairest votary took up that fire<br/>
Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;<br/>
And so the general of hot desire<br/>
Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm'd.<br/>
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,<br/>
Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,<br/>
Growing a bath and healthful remedy,<br/>
For men diseas'd; but I, my mistress' thrall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came there for cure and this by that I prove, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.<br/>
</p>
<p>THE END</p>

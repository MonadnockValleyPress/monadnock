<h1>Othello</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Before the castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and Clown</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>I dare not say he lies any where.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Why, man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>is stabbing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Go to: where lodges he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Can any thing be made of this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a</span><br/>
<span id='10'>lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were</span><br/>
<span id='11'>to lie in mine own throat.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>I will catechise the world for him; that is, make</span><br/>
<span id='14'>questions, and by them answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have</span><br/>
<span id='16'>moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and</span><br/>
<span id='18'>therefore I will attempt the doing it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>I know not, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Is true of mind and made of no such baseness</span><br/>
<span id='24'>As jealous creatures are, it were enough</span><br/>
<span id='25'>To put him to ill thinking.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Is he not jealous?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Who, he? I think the sun where he was born</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Drew all such humours from him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Look, where he comes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>I will not leave him now till Cassio</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Be call'd to him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter OTHELLO</em></p>
<span id='32'>How is't with you, my lord</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Well, my good lady.</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='34'>O, hardness to dissemble!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>How do you, Desdemona?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Well, my good lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires</span><br/>
<span id='41'>A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Much castigation, exercise devout;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>For here's a young and sweating devil here,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>A frank one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>                  You may, indeed, say so;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>What promise, chuck?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Lend me thy handkerchief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Here, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>That which I gave you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>I have it not about me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>   No, indeed, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>That is a fault.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>That handkerchief</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Did an Egyptian to my mother give;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>She was a charmer, and could almost read</span><br/>
<span id='64'>The thoughts of people: she told her, while</span><br/>
<span id='65'>she kept it,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Entirely to her love, but if she lost it</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Or made gift of it, my father's eye</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt</span><br/>
<span id='70'>After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Make it a darling like your precious eye;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>To lose't or give't away were such perdition</span><br/>
<span id='75'>As nothing else could match.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Is't possible?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>A sibyl, that had number'd in the world</span><br/>
<span id='79'>The sun to course two hundred compasses,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Conserved of maidens' hearts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Indeed! is't true?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Most veritable; therefore look to't well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Then would to God that I had never seen't!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Ha! wherefore?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Why do you speak so startingly and rash?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out</span><br/>
<span id='90'>o' the way?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Heaven bless us!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Say you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>It is not lost; but what an if it were?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>How!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>I say, it is not lost.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Fetch't, let me see't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>This is a trick to put me from my suit:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Pray you, let Cassio be received again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Come, come;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>You'll never meet a more sufficient man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>The handkerchief!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>                  I pray, talk me of Cassio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>The handkerchief!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>                  A man that all his time</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Shared dangers with you,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>The handkerchief!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>In sooth, you are to blame.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Away!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Is not this man jealous?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>I ne'er saw this before.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:</span><br/>
<span id='115'>I am most unhappy in the loss of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CASSIO and IAGO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:</span><br/>
<span id='121'>And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you</span><br/>
<span id='124'>That by your virtuous means I may again</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Exist, and be a member of his love</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Whom I with all the office of my heart</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.</span><br/>
<span id='128'>If my offence be of such mortal kind</span><br/>
<span id='129'>That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Nor purposed merit in futurity,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Can ransom me into his love again,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>But to know so must be my benefit;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>So shall I clothe me in a forced content,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And shut myself up in some other course,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>To fortune's alms.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>                  Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!</span><br/>
<span id='137'>My advocation is not now in tune;</span><br/>
<span id='138'>My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.</span><br/>
<span id='140'>So help me every spirit sanctified,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>As I have spoken for you all my best</span><br/>
<span id='142'>And stood within the blank of his displeasure</span><br/>
<span id='143'>For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:</span><br/>
<span id='144'>What I can do I will; and more I will</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Is my lord angry?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>                  He went hence but now,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>And certainly in strange unquietness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>When it hath blown his ranks into the air,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>And, like the devil, from his very arm</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Puff'd his own brother:&mdash;and can he be angry?</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Something of moment then: I will go meet him:</span><br/>
<span id='154'>There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>I prithee, do so.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit IAGO</em></p>
<span id='156'>Something, sure, of state,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;</span><br/>
<span id='162'>For let our finger ache, and it indues</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Our other healthful members even to that sense</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Nor of them look for such observances</span><br/>
<span id='166'>As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>And he's indicted falsely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And no conception nor no jealous toy</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Concerning you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>Alas the day! I never gave him cause.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;</span><br/>
<span id='176'>They are not ever jealous for the cause,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Begot upon itself, born on itself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Lady, amen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:</span><br/>
<span id='182'>If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit</span><br/>
<span id='183'>And seek to effect it to my uttermost.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>I humbly thank your ladyship.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA</em></p>
<p><em>Enter BIANCA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>Save you, friend Cassio!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>What make you from home?</span><br/>
<span id='187'>How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?</span><br/>
<span id='188'>I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.</span><br/>
<span id='190'>What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>More tedious than the dial eight score times?</span><br/>
<span id='193'>O weary reckoning!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>                  Pardon me, Bianca:</span><br/>
<span id='195'>I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:</span><br/>
<span id='196'>But I shall, in a more continuate time,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,</span><br/>
<p><em>Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief</em></p>
<span id='198'>Take me this work out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>O Cassio, whence came this?</span><br/>
<span id='200'>This is some token from a newer friend:</span><br/>
<span id='201'>To the felt absence now I feel a cause:</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Is't come to this? Well, well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>Go to, woman!</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>From whence you have them. You are jealous now</span><br/>
<span id='206'>That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:</span><br/>
<span id='207'>No, in good troth, Bianca.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>Why, whose is it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='209'>I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.</span><br/>
<span id='210'>I like the work well: ere it be demanded&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='211'>As like enough it will&mdash;I'ld have it copied:</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='213'>Leave you! wherefore?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>I do attend here on the general;</span><br/>
<span id='215'>And think it no addition, nor my wish,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>To have him see me woman'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech89'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>Why, I pray you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech90'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>Not that I love you not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech91'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='219'>But that you do not love me.</span><br/>
<span id='220'>I pray you, bring me on the way a little,</span><br/>
<span id='221'>And say if I shall see you soon at night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech92'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='222'>'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;</span><br/>
<span id='223'>For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech93'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='224'>'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

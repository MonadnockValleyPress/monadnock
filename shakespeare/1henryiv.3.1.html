<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</H3>
<h4>Bangor. The Archdeacon's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>These promises are fair, the parties sure,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And our induction full of prosperous hope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Will you sit down?</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!</span><br/>
<span id='6'>I have forgot the map.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>No, here it is.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>For by that name as oft as Lancaster</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with</span><br/>
<span id='11'>A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>I cannot blame him: at my nativity</span><br/>
<span id='14'>The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Of burning cressets; and at my birth</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The frame and huge foundation of the earth</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Shaked like a coward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Why, so it would have done at the same season, if</span><br/>
<span id='19'>your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself</span><br/>
<span id='20'>had never been born.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>I say the earth did shake when I was born.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>And I say the earth was not of my mind,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>If you suppose as fearing you it shook.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And not in fear of your nativity.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth</span><br/>
<span id='28'>In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd</span><br/>
<span id='30'>By the imprisoning of unruly wind</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>In passion shook.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>                  Cousin, of many men</span><br/>
<span id='37'>I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave</span><br/>
<span id='38'>To tell you once again that at my birth</span><br/>
<span id='39'>The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.</span><br/>
<span id='42'>These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And all the courses of my life do show</span><br/>
<span id='44'>I am not in the roll of common men.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea</span><br/>
<span id='46'>That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And bring him out that is but woman's son</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Can trace me in the tedious ways of art</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And hold me pace in deep experiments.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>I'll to dinner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>I can call spirits from the vasty deep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Why, so can I, or so can any man;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>But will they come when you do call for them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command</span><br/>
<span id='58'>The devil.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil</span><br/>
<span id='60'>By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Bootless home and weather-beaten back.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Home without boots, and in foul weather too!</span><br/>
<span id='70'>How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right</span><br/>
<span id='72'>According to our threefold order ta'en?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>The archdeacon hath divided it</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Into three limits very equally:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>By south and east is to my part assign'd:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And all the fertile land within that bound,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you</span><br/>
<span id='80'>The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And our indentures tripartite are drawn;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Which being sealed interchangeably,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>A business that this night may execute,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth</span><br/>
<span id='86'>To meet your father and the Scottish power,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>My father Glendower is not ready yet,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Within that space you may have drawn together</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And in my conduct shall your ladies come;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>From whom you now must steal and take no leave,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>For there will be a world of water shed</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Upon the parting of your wives and you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>In quantity equals not one of yours:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>See how this river comes me cranking in,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And cuts me from the best of all my land</span><br/>
<span id='101'>A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And here the smug and silver Trent shall run</span><br/>
<span id='104'>In a new channel, fair and evenly;</span><br/>
<span id='105'>It shall not wind with such a deep indent,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>To rob me of so rich a bottom here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Yea, but</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up</span><br/>
<span id='110'>With like advantage on the other side;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Gelding the opposed continent as much</span><br/>
<span id='112'>As on the other side it takes from you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Yea, but a little charge will trench him here</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And on this north side win this cape of land;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And then he runs straight and even.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>I'll not have it alter'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Will not you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>No, nor you shall not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Who shall say me nay?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Why, that will I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>I can speak English, lord, as well as you;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>For I was train'd up in the English court;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Where, being but young, I framed to the harp</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Many an English ditty lovely well</span><br/>
<span id='127'>And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>A virtue that was never seen in you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Marry,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And I am glad of it with all my heart:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>I had rather be a kitten and cry mew</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Nothing so much as mincing poetry:</span><br/>
<span id='137'>'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land</span><br/>
<span id='140'>To any well-deserving friend;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>The moon shines fair; you may away by night:</span><br/>
<span id='145'>I'll haste the writer and withal</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Break with your wives of your departure hence:</span><br/>
<span id='147'>I am afraid my daughter will run mad,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>So much she doteth on her Mortimer.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit GLENDOWER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>I cannot choose: sometime he angers me</span><br/>
<span id='151'>With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>And of a dragon and a finless fish,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>A couching lion and a ramping cat,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff</span><br/>
<span id='157'>As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>He held me last night at least nine hours</span><br/>
<span id='159'>In reckoning up the several devils' names</span><br/>
<span id='160'>That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'</span><br/>
<span id='161'>But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious</span><br/>
<span id='162'>As a tired horse, a railing wife;</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live</span><br/>
<span id='164'>With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Than feed on cates and have him talk to me</span><br/>
<span id='166'>In any summer-house in Christendom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Exceedingly well read, and profited</span><br/>
<span id='169'>In strange concealments, valiant as a lion</span><br/>
<span id='170'>And as wondrous affable and as bountiful</span><br/>
<span id='171'>As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?</span><br/>
<span id='172'>He holds your temper in a high respect</span><br/>
<span id='173'>And curbs himself even of his natural scope</span><br/>
<span id='174'>When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:</span><br/>
<span id='175'>I warrant you, that man is not alive</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Might so have tempted him as you have done,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Without the taste of danger and reproof:</span><br/>
<span id='178'>But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;</span><br/>
<span id='180'>And since your coming hither have done enough</span><br/>
<span id='181'>To put him quite beside his patience.</span><br/>
<span id='182'>You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='184'>And that's the dearest grace it renders you,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Defect of manners, want of government,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:</span><br/>
<span id='188'>The least of which haunting a nobleman</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Upon the beauty of all parts besides,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Beguiling them of commendation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>This is the deadly spite that angers me;</span><br/>
<span id='195'>My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;</span><br/>
<span id='197'>She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Shall follow in your conduct speedily.</span><br/>
<p><em>Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>one that no persuasion can do good upon.</span><br/>
<p><em>The lady speaks in Welsh</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens</span><br/>
<span id='204'>I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>In such a parley should I answer thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>The lady speaks again in Welsh</em></p>
<span id='206'>I understand thy kisses and thou mine,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>And that's a feeling disputation:</span><br/>
<span id='208'>But I will never be a truant, love,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,</span><br/>
<span id='212'>With ravishing division, to her lute.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='213'>Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.</span><br/>
<p><em>The lady speaks again in Welsh</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>O, I am ignorance itself in this!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='215'>She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down</span><br/>
<span id='216'>And rest your gentle head upon her lap,</span><br/>
<span id='217'>And she will sing the song that pleaseth you</span><br/>
<span id='218'>And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,</span><br/>
<span id='220'>Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep</span><br/>
<span id='221'>As is the difference betwixt day and night</span><br/>
<span id='222'>The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team</span><br/>
<span id='223'>Begins his golden progress in the east.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>MORTIMER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='224'>With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:</span><br/>
<span id='225'>By that time will our book, I think, be drawn</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>GLENDOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='226'>Do so;</span><br/>
<span id='227'>And those musicians that shall play to you</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,</span><br/>
<span id='229'>And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='230'>Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,</span><br/>
<span id='231'>quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>LADY PERCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='232'>Go, ye giddy goose.</span><br/>
<p><em>The music plays</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='233'>Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;</span><br/>
<span id='234'>And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.</span><br/>
<span id='235'>By'r lady, he is a good musician.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>LADY PERCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='236'>Then should you be nothing but musical for you are</span><br/>
<span id='237'>altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,</span><br/>
<span id='238'>and hear the lady sing in Welsh.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='239'>I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>LADY PERCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='240'>Wouldst thou have thy head broken?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='241'>No.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>LADY PERCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='242'>Then be still.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='243'>Neither;'tis a woman's fault.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>LADY PERCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='244'>Now God help thee!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='245'>To the Welsh lady's bed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>LADY PERCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='246'>What's that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='247'>Peace! she sings.</span><br/>
<p><em>Here the lady sings a Welsh song</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='248'>Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>LADY PERCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='249'>Not mine, in good sooth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='250'>Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a</span><br/>
<span id='251'>comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and</span><br/>
<span id='252'>'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and</span><br/>
<span id='253'>'as sure as day,'</span><br/>
<span id='254'>And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,</span><br/>

<h1>Henry V</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The same. Before the gates.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>The Governor and some Citizens on the walls; the English forces below. Enter KING HENRY and his train</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>How yet resolves the governor of the town?</span><br/>
<span id='2'>This is the latest parle we will admit;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Or like to men proud of destruction</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>If I begin the battery once again,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Till in her ashes she lie buried.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>In liberty of bloody hand shall range</span><br/>
<span id='13'>With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>What is it then to me, if impious war,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Enlink'd to waste and desolation?</span><br/>
<span id='19'>What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>If your pure maidens fall into the hand</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Of hot and forcing violation?</span><br/>
<span id='22'>What rein can hold licentious wickedness</span><br/>
<span id='23'>When down the hill he holds his fierce career?</span><br/>
<span id='24'>We may as bootless spend our vain command</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil</span><br/>
<span id='26'>As send precepts to the leviathan</span><br/>
<span id='27'>To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Take pity of your town and of your people,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace</span><br/>
<span id='31'>O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Of heady murder, spoil and villany.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>If not, why, in a moment look to see</span><br/>
<span id='34'>The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Your fathers taken by the silver beards,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry</span><br/>
<span id='41'>At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.</span><br/>
<span id='42'>What say you? will you yield, and this avoid,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GOVERNOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Our expectation hath this day an end:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Returns us that his powers are yet not ready</span><br/>
<span id='47'>To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great king,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>For we no longer are defensible.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Open your gates. Come, uncle Exeter,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Use mercy to them all. For us, dear uncle,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>The winter coming on and sickness growing</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>To-night in Harfleur we will be your guest;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>To-morrow for the march are we addrest.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish. The King and his train enter the town</em></p>

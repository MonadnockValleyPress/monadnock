<h1>Henry VI, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter three or four Petitioners, PETER, the Armourer's man, being one</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Petitioner</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>My masters, let's stand close: my lord protector</span><br/>
<span id='2'>will come this way by and by, and then we may deliver</span><br/>
<span id='3'>our supplications in the quill.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Petitioner</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Marry, the Lord protect him, for he's a good man!</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Jesu bless him!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SUFFOLK and QUEEN MARGARET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>PETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Here a' comes, methinks, and the queen with him.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>I'll be the first, sure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Petitioner</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Come back, fool; this is the Duke of Suffolk, and</span><br/>
<span id='9'>not my lord protector.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>How now, fellow! would'st anything with me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>First Petitioner</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>I pray, my lord, pardon me; I took ye for my lord</span><br/>
<span id='12'>protector.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>[Reading]  'To my Lord Protector!' Are your</span><br/>
<span id='14'>supplications to his lordship? Let me see them:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>what is thine?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>First Petitioner</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Mine is, an't please your grace, against John</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Goodman, my lord cardinal's man, for keeping my</span><br/>
<span id='18'>house, and lands, and wife and all, from me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Thy wife, too! that's some wrong, indeed. What's</span><br/>
<span id='20'>yours? What's here!</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='21'>'Against the Duke of Suffolk, for enclosing the</span><br/>
<span id='22'>commons of Melford.' How now, sir knave!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Second Petitioner</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Alas, sir, I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>[Giving his petition]  Against my master, Thomas</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Horner, for saying that the Duke of York was rightful</span><br/>
<span id='26'>heir to the crown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>What sayst thou? did the Duke of York say he was</span><br/>
<span id='28'>rightful heir to the crown?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>That my master was? no, forsooth: my master said</span><br/>
<span id='30'>that he was, and that the king was an usurper.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Who is there?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Servant</em></p>
<span id='32'>Take this fellow in, and send for</span><br/>
<span id='33'>his master with a pursuivant presently: we'll hear</span><br/>
<span id='34'>more of your matter before the King.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Servant with PETER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>And as for you, that love to be protected</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Under the wings of our protector's grace,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Begin your suits anew, and sue to him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Tears the supplication</em></p>
<span id='38'>Away, base cullions! Suffolk, let them go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Come, let's be gone.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Is this the fashion in the court of England?</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Is this the government of Britain's isle,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And this the royalty of Albion's king?</span><br/>
<span id='44'>What shall King Henry be a pupil still</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Under the surly Gloucester's governance?</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Am I a queen in title and in style,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And must be made a subject to a duke?</span><br/>
<span id='48'>I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And stolest away the ladies' hearts of France,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>I thought King Henry had resembled thee</span><br/>
<span id='52'>In courage, courtship and proportion:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>But all his mind is bent to holiness,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>To number Ave-Maries on his beads;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>His champions are the prophets and apostles,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Are brazen images of canonized saints.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>I would the college of the cardinals</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Would choose him pope, and carry him to Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And set the triple crown upon his head:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>That were a state fit for his holiness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Madam, be patient: as I was cause</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Your highness came to England, so will I</span><br/>
<span id='65'>In England work your grace's full content.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Beside the haughty protector, have we Beaufort,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And grumbling York: and not the least of these</span><br/>
<span id='69'>But can do more in England than the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>And he of these that can do most of all</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Cannot do more in England than the Nevils:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Not all these lords do vex me half so much</span><br/>
<span id='74'>As that proud dame, the lord protector's wife.</span><br/>
<span id='75'>She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Strangers in court do take her for the queen:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>She bears a duke's revenues on her back,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>And in her heart she scorns our poverty:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Shall I not live to be avenged on her?</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Contemptuous base-born callet as she is,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>She vaunted 'mongst her minions t'other day,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>The very train of her worst wearing gown</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Was better worth than all my father's lands,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Madam, myself have limed a bush for her,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And placed a quire of such enticing birds,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>That she will light to listen to the lays,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And never mount to trouble you again.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>So, let her rest: and, madam, list to me;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>For I am bold to counsel you in this.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Although we fancy not the cardinal,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Yet must we join with him and with the lords,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>As for the Duke of York, this late complaint</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Will make but little for his benefit.</span><br/>
<span id='97'>So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.</span><br/>
<p><em>Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER,  CARDINAL, BUCKINGHAM, YORK, SOMERSET, SALISBURY, WARWICK, and the DUCHESS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>For my part, noble lords, I care not which;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Or Somerset or York, all's one to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>If York have ill demean'd himself in France,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Then let him be denay'd the regentship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>If Somerset be unworthy of the place,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Let York be regent; I will yield to him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Whether your grace be worthy, yea or no,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Dispute not that: York is the worthier.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>The cardinal's not my better in the field.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Warwick may live to be the best of all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Peace, son! and show some reason, Buckingham,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Why Somerset should be preferred in this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Because the king, forsooth, will have it so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Madam, the king is old enough himself</span><br/>
<span id='115'>To give his censure: these are no women's matters.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>If he be old enough, what needs your grace</span><br/>
<span id='117'>To be protector of his excellence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Madam, I am protector of the realm;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And, at his pleasure, will resign my place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Resign it then and leave thine insolence.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Since thou wert king&mdash;as who is king but thou?&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And all the peers and nobles of the realm</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>The commons hast thou rack'd; the clergy's bags</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Are lank and lean with thy extortions.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Have cost a mass of public treasury.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Thy cruelty in execution</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Upon offenders, hath exceeded law,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>And left thee to the mercy of the law.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>They sale of offices and towns in France,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>If they were known, as the suspect is great,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit GLOUCESTER. QUEEN MARGARET drops her fan</em></p>
<span id='136'>Give me my fan: what, minion! can ye not?</span><br/>
<p><em>She gives the DUCHESS a box on the ear</em></p>
<span id='137'>I cry you mercy, madam; was it you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Was't I! yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman:</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Could I come near your beauty with my nails,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>I'd set my ten commandments in your face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Sweet aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Against her will! good king, look to't in time;</span><br/>
<span id='143'>She'll hamper thee, and dandle thee like a baby:</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Though in this place most master wear no breeches,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Lord cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds:</span><br/>
<span id='148'>She's tickled now; her fume needs no spurs,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>She'll gallop far enough to her destruction.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter GLOUCESTER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Now, lords, my choler being over-blown</span><br/>
<span id='151'>With walking once about the quadrangle,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.</span><br/>
<span id='153'>As for your spiteful false objections,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Prove them, and I lie open to the law:</span><br/>
<span id='155'>But God in mercy so deal with my soul,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>As I in duty love my king and country!</span><br/>
<span id='157'>But, to the matter that we have in hand:</span><br/>
<span id='158'>I say, my sovereign, York is meetest man</span><br/>
<span id='159'>To be your regent in the realm of France.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Before we make election, give me leave</span><br/>
<span id='161'>To show some reason, of no little force,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>That York is most unmeet of any man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:</span><br/>
<span id='164'>First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Next, if I be appointed for the place,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>My Lord of Somerset will keep me here,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Without discharge, money, or furniture,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands:</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Last time, I danced attendance on his will</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Till Paris was besieged, famish'd, and lost.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>That can I witness; and a fouler fact</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Did never traitor in the land commit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>Peace, headstrong Warwick!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HORNER, the Armourer, and his man PETER, guarded</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>Because here is a man accused of treason:</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>What mean'st thou, Suffolk; tell me, what are these?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Please it your majesty, this is the man</span><br/>
<span id='180'>That doth accuse his master of high treason:</span><br/>
<span id='181'>His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Was rightful heir unto the English crown</span><br/>
<span id='183'>And that your majesty was a usurper.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>Say, man, were these thy words?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>HORNER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>An't shall please your majesty, I never said nor</span><br/>
<span id='186'>thought any such matter: God is my witness, I am</span><br/>
<span id='187'>falsely accused by the villain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>PETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>By these ten bones, my lords, he did speak them to</span><br/>
<span id='189'>me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Lord of York's armour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>Base dunghill villain and mechanical,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.</span><br/>
<span id='193'>I do beseech your royal majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Let him have all the rigor of the law.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>HORNER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>Alas, my lord, hang me, if ever I spake the words.</span><br/>
<span id='196'>My accuser is my 'prentice; and when I did correct</span><br/>
<span id='197'>him for his fault the other day, he did vow upon his</span><br/>
<span id='198'>knees he would be even with me: I have good</span><br/>
<span id='199'>witness of this: therefore I beseech your majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>do not cast away an honest man for a villain's</span><br/>
<span id='201'>accusation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>This doom, my lord, if I may judge:</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Let Somerset be regent over the French,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Because in York this breeds suspicion:</span><br/>
<span id='206'>And let these have a day appointed them</span><br/>
<span id='207'>For single combat in convenient place,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>For he hath witness of his servant's malice:</span><br/>
<span id='209'>This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey's doom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>I humbly thank your royal majesty.</span><br/>

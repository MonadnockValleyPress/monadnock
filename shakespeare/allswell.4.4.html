<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Florence. The Widow's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter HELENA, Widow, and DIANA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>One of the greatest in the Christian world</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Shall be my surety; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Time was, I did him a desired office,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Dear almost as his life; which gratitude</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And answer, thanks: I duly am inform'd</span><br/>
<span id='9'>His grace is at Marseilles; to which place</span><br/>
<span id='10'>We have convenient convoy. You must know</span><br/>
<span id='11'>I am supposed dead: the army breaking,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And by the leave of my good lord the king,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>We'll be before our welcome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Gentle madam,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>You never had a servant to whose trust</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Your business was more welcome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Nor you, mistress,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To recompense your love: doubt not but heaven</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>As it hath fated her to be my motive</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!</span><br/>
<span id='24'>That can such sweet use make of what they hate,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play</span><br/>
<span id='27'>With what it loathes for that which is away.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Under my poor instructions yet must suffer</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Something in my behalf.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Let death and honesty</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Go with your impositions, I am yours</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Upon your will to suffer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Yet, I pray you:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>But with the word the time will bring on summer,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>All's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Henry VI, Part 3</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene III</h3>
<h4>France. King Lewis XI's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Flourish. Enter KING LEWIS XI, his sister BONA,  his Admiral, called BOURBON, PRINCE EDWARD, QUEEN  MARGARET, and OXFORD. KING LEWIS XI sits, and riseth up again</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>No, mighty King of France: now Margaret</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Where kings command. I was, I must confess,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Great Albion's queen in former golden days:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>But now mischance hath trod my title down,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And with dishonour laid me on the ground;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And to my humble seat conform myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And sit thee by our side:</span><br/>
<p><em>Seats her by him</em></p>
<span id='17'>Yield not thy neck</span><br/>
<span id='18'>To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Still ride in triumph over all mischance.</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>That Henry, sole possessor of my love,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Is of a king become a banish'd man,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Usurps the regal title and the seat</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Of England's true-anointed lawful king.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Our people and our peers are both misled,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>While we bethink a means to break it off.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter WARWICK</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?</span><br/>
<p><em>He descends. She ariseth</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>For this is he that moves both wind and tide.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>From worthy Edward, King of Albion,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>First, to do greetings to thy royal person;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And then to crave a league of amity;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And lastly, to confirm that amity</span><br/>
<span id='56'>With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant</span><br/>
<span id='57'>That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>To England's king in lawful marriage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>[Aside]  If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>[To BONA]  And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>I am commanded, with your leave and favour,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue</span><br/>
<span id='63'>To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Before you answer Warwick. His demand</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>But from deceit bred by necessity;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>For how can tyrants safely govern home,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?</span><br/>
<span id='72'>To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Injurious Margaret!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>And why not queen?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Because thy father Henry did usurp;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And thou no more are prince than she is queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>OXFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Who by his prowess conquered all France:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>From these our Henry lineally descends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost</span><br/>
<span id='92'>All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>But for the rest, you tell a pedigree</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Of threescore and two years; a silly time</span><br/>
<span id='96'>To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>OXFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And not bewray thy treason with a blush?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?</span><br/>
<span id='102'>For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>OXFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Call him my king by whose injurious doom</span><br/>
<span id='104'>My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Was done to death? and more than so, my father,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>When nature brought him to the door of death?</span><br/>
<span id='108'>No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>And I the house of York.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>While I use further conference with Warwick.</span><br/>
<p><em>They stand aloof</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Is Edward your true king? for I were loath</span><br/>
<span id='117'>To link with him that were not lawful chosen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>But is he gracious in the people's eye?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>The more that Henry was unfortunate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Then further, all dissembling set aside,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Tell me for truth the measure of his love</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Unto our sister Bona.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Such it seems</span><br/>
<span id='125'>As may beseem a monarch like himself.</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Myself have often heard him say and swear</span><br/>
<span id='127'>That this his love was an eternal plant,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:</span><br/>
<p><em>To WARWICK</em></p>
<span id='134'>Yet I confess that often ere this day,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>When I have heard your king's desert recounted,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;</span><br/>
<span id='138'>And now forthwith shall articles be drawn</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Touching the jointure that your king must make,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness</span><br/>
<span id='142'>That Bona shall be wife to the English king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>To Edward, but not to the English king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device</span><br/>
<span id='145'>By this alliance to make void my suit:</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>And still is friend to him and Margaret:</span><br/>
<span id='148'>But if your title to the crown be weak,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>As may appear by Edward's good success,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Then 'tis but reason that I be released</span><br/>
<span id='151'>From giving aid which late I promised.</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand</span><br/>
<span id='153'>That your estate requires and mine can yield.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.</span><br/>
<span id='156'>And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>You have a father able to maintain you;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>And better 'twere you troubled him than France.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Proud setter up and puller down of kings!</span><br/>
<span id='161'>I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;</span><br/>
<span id='164'>For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.</span><br/>
<p><em>Post blows a horn within</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Post</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>Post</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>[To WARWICK]  My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague:</span><br/>
<p><em>To KING LEWIS XI</em></p>
<span id='168'>These from our king unto your majesty:</span><br/>
<p><em>To QUEEN MARGARET</em></p>
<span id='169'>And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not.</span><br/>
<p><em>They all read their letters</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>OXFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>I like it well that our fair queen and mistress</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:</span><br/>
<span id='173'>I hope all's for the best.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>What! has your king married the Lady Grey!</span><br/>
<span id='178'>And now, to soothe your forgery and his,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>I told your majesty as much before:</span><br/>
<span id='183'>This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>No more my king, for he dishonours me,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>But most himself, if he could see his shame.</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Did I forget that by the house of York</span><br/>
<span id='190'>My father came untimely to his death?</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Did I impale him with the regal crown?</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Did I put Henry from his native right?</span><br/>
<span id='194'>And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:</span><br/>
<span id='196'>And to repair my honour lost for him,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>I here renounce him and return to Henry.</span><br/>
<span id='198'>My noble queen, let former grudges pass,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>And henceforth I am thy true servitor:</span><br/>
<span id='200'>I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>And replant Henry in his former state.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;</span><br/>
<span id='203'>And I forgive and quite forget old faults,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us</span><br/>
<span id='207'>With some few bands of chosen soldiers,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>I'll undertake to land them on our coast</span><br/>
<span id='209'>And force the tyrant from his seat by war.</span><br/>
<span id='210'>'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:</span><br/>
<span id='211'>And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,</span><br/>
<span id='212'>He's very likely now to fall from him,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>For matching more for wanton lust than honour,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Or than for strength and safety of our country.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>BONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='215'>Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged</span><br/>
<span id='216'>But by thy help to this distressed queen?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,</span><br/>
<span id='218'>Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>BONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='219'>My quarrel and this English queen's are one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='220'>And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.</span><br/>
<span id='222'>Therefore at last I firmly am resolved</span><br/>
<span id='223'>You shall have aid.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='224'>Let me give humble thanks for all at once.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='225'>Then, England's messenger, return in post,</span><br/>
<span id='226'>And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,</span><br/>
<span id='227'>That Lewis of France is sending over masquers</span><br/>
<span id='228'>To revel it with him and his new bride:</span><br/>
<span id='229'>Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>BONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='230'>Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,</span><br/>
<span id='231'>I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='232'>Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,</span><br/>
<span id='233'>And I am ready to put armour on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='234'>Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.</span><br/>
<span id='236'>There's thy reward: be gone.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Post</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='237'>But, Warwick,</span><br/>
<span id='238'>Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,</span><br/>
<span id='239'>Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;</span><br/>
<span id='240'>And, as occasion serves, this noble queen</span><br/>
<span id='241'>And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.</span><br/>
<span id='242'>Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,</span><br/>
<span id='243'>What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='244'>This shall assure my constant loyalty,</span><br/>
<span id='245'>That if our queen and this young prince agree,</span><br/>
<span id='246'>I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy</span><br/>
<span id='247'>To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='248'>Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.</span><br/>
<span id='249'>Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,</span><br/>
<span id='250'>Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;</span><br/>
<span id='251'>And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,</span><br/>
<span id='252'>That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='253'>Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;</span><br/>
<span id='254'>And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.</span><br/>
<p><em>He gives his hand to WARWICK</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>KING LEWIS XI</strong></span>

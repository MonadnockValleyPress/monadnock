</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester's wife:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>In sight of God and us, your guilt is great:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Receive the sentence of the law for sins</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Such as by God's book are adjudged to death.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>You four, from hence to prison back again;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>From thence unto the place of execution:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>The witch in Smithfield shall be burn'd to ashes,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>You, madam, for you are more nobly born,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Despoiled of your honour in your life,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Shall, after three days' open penance done,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Live in your country here in banishment,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>With Sir John Stanley, in the Isle of Man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Welcome is banishment; welcome were my death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Eleanor, the law, thou see'st, hath judged thee:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>I cannot justify whom the law condemns.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt DUCHESS and other prisoners, guarded</em></p>
<span id='17'>Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Ah, Humphrey, this dishonour in thine age</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground!</span><br/>
<span id='20'>I beseech your majesty, give me leave to go;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Stay, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester: ere thou go,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Give up thy staff: Henry will to himself</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Protector be; and God shall be my hope,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>My stay, my guide and lantern to my feet:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And go in peace, Humphrey, no less beloved</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Than when thou wert protector to thy King.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>I see no reason why a king of years</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Should be to be protected like a child.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>God and King Henry govern England's realm.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Give up your staff, sir, and the king his realm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>My staff? here, noble Henry, is my staff:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>As willingly do I the same resign</span><br/>
<span id='34'>As e'er thy father Henry made it mine;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it</span><br/>
<span id='36'>As others would ambitiously receive it.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Farewell, good king: when I am dead and gone,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>May honourable peace attend thy throne!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Why, now is Henry king, and Margaret queen;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>That bears so shrewd a maim; two pulls at once;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>His lady banish'd, and a limb lopp'd off.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>This staff of honour raught, there let it stand</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Where it best fits to be, in Henry's hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Lords, let him go. Please it your majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>This is the day appointed for the combat;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And ready are the appellant and defendant,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>The armourer and his man, to enter the lists,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>So please your highness to behold the fight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Ay, good my lord; for purposely therefore</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>O God's name, see the lists and all things fit:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Here let them end it; and God defend the right!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>I never saw a fellow worse bested,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Or more afraid to fight, than is the appellant,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>The servant of this armourer, my lords.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter at one door, HORNER, the Armourer, and his  Neighbours, drinking to him so much that he is drunk;  and he enters with a drum before him and his staff  with a sand-bag fastened to it; and at the other  door PETER, his man, with a drum and sand-bag, and 'Prentices drinking to him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>First Neighbour</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Here, neighbour Horner, I drink to you in a cup of</span><br/>
<span id='60'>sack: and fear not, neighbour, you shall do well enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Second Neighbour</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>And here, neighbour, here's a cup of charneco.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Third Neighbour</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>And here's a pot of good double beer, neighbour:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>drink, and fear not your man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HORNER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Let it come, i' faith, and I'll pledge you all; and</span><br/>
<span id='65'>a fig for Peter!</span><br/>
<span id='66'>First 'Prentice	Here, Peter, I drink to thee: and be not afraid.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Second 'Prentice	Be merry, Peter, and fear not thy master: fight</span><br/>
<span id='68'>for credit of the 'prentices.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>I thank you all: drink, and pray for me, I pray</span><br/>
<span id='70'>you; for I think I have taken my last draught in</span><br/>
<span id='71'>this world. Here, Robin, an if I die, I give thee</span><br/>
<span id='72'>my apron: and, Will, thou shalt have my hammer:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>and here, Tom, take all the money that I have. O</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Lord bless me! I pray God! for I am never able to</span><br/>
<span id='75'>deal with my master, he hath learnt me so much fence already.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Come, leave your drinking, and fall to blows.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Sirrah, what's thy name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Peter, forsooth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Peter! what more?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Thump.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Thump! then see thou thump thy master well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HORNER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon my man's</span><br/>
<span id='83'>instigation, to prove him a knave and myself an</span><br/>
<span id='84'>honest man: and touching the Duke of York, I will</span><br/>
<span id='85'>take my death, I never meant him any ill, nor the</span><br/>
<span id='86'>king, nor the queen: and therefore, Peter, have at</span><br/>
<span id='87'>thee with a downright blow!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Dispatch: this knave's tongue begins to double.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Sound, trumpets, alarum to the combatants!</span><br/>
<p><em>Alarum. They fight, and PETER strikes him down</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>HORNER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Hold, Peter, hold! I confess, I confess treason.</span><br/>
<p><em>Dies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Take away his weapon. Fellow, thank God, and the</span><br/>
<span id='92'>good wine in thy master's way.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>O God, have I overcome mine enemy in this presence?</span><br/>
<span id='94'>O Peter, thou hast prevailed in right!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Go, take hence that traitor from our sight;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>For his death we do perceive his guilt:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And God in justice hath revealed to us</span><br/>
<span id='98'>The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Which he had thought to have murder'd wrongfully.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward.</span><br/>
<p><em>Sound a flourish. Exeunt</em></p>

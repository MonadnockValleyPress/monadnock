<h1>Taming of the Shrew</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Induction, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Before an alehouse on a heath.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Hostess and SLY</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I'll pheeze you, in faith.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Hostess</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>A pair of stocks, you rogue!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in</span><br/>
<span id='4'>the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Hostess</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold</span><br/>
<span id='8'>bed, and warm thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Hostess</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>I know my remedy; I must go fetch the</span><br/>
<span id='10'>third&mdash;borough.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him</span><br/>
<span id='12'>by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>and kindly.</span><br/>
<p><em>Falls asleep</em></p>
<p><em>Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And couple Clowder with the deep&mdash;mouth'd brach.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good</span><br/>
<span id='18'>At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>First Huntsman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>He cried upon it at the merest loss</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Trust me, I take him for the better dog.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>I would esteem him worth a dozen such.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>But sup them well and look unto them all:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>To-morrow I intend to hunt again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>First Huntsman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>I will, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Second Huntsman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>A most delicious banquet by his bed,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And brave attendants near him when he wakes,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Would not the beggar then forget himself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Huntsman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Second Huntsman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>It would seem strange unto him when he waked.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Then take him up and manage well the jest:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Carry him gently to my fairest chamber</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Procure me music ready when he wakes,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And if he chance to speak, be ready straight</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And with a low submissive reverence</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Say 'What is it your honour will command?'</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Let one attend him with a silver basin</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Some one be ready with a costly suit</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And ask him what apparel he will wear;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Another tell him of his hounds and horse,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And that his lady mourns at his disease:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And when he says he is, say that he dreams,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>For he is nothing but a mighty lord.</span><br/>
<span id='64'>This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>It will be pastime passing excellent,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>If it be husbanded with modesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>First Huntsman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>As he shall think by our true diligence</span><br/>
<span id='69'>He is no less than what we say he is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Take him up gently and to bed with him;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And each one to his office when he wakes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds</em></p>
<span id='72'>Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Servingman</em></p>
<span id='73'>Belike, some noble gentleman that means,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Travelling some journey, to repose him here.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Servingman</em></p>
<span id='75'>How now! who is it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>An't please your honour, players</span><br/>
<span id='77'>That offer service to your lordship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Bid them come near.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Players</em></p>
<span id='79'>Now, fellows, you are welcome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Players</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>We thank your honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Do you intend to stay with me tonight?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>A Player</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>So please your lordship to accept our duty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>With all my heart. This fellow I remember,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>A Player</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Well, you are come to me in a happy time;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>The rather for I have some sport in hand</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Wherein your cunning can assist me much.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>There is a lord will hear you play to-night:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>But I am doubtful of your modesties;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>For yet his honour never heard a play&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>You break into some merry passion</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>If you should smile he grows impatient.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>A Player</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Were he the veriest antic in the world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And give them friendly welcome every one:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Let them want nothing that my house affords.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit one with the Players</em></p>
<span id='105'>Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Tell him from me, as he will win my love,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>He bear himself with honourable action,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Such as he hath observed in noble ladies</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Unto their lords, by them accomplished:</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Such duty to the drunkard let him do</span><br/>
<span id='114'>With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And say 'What is't your honour will command,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Wherein your lady and your humble wife</span><br/>
<span id='117'>May show her duty and make known her love?'</span><br/>
<span id='118'>And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And with declining head into his bosom,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd</span><br/>
<span id='121'>To see her noble lord restored to health,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him</span><br/>
<span id='123'>No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And if the boy have not a woman's gift</span><br/>
<span id='125'>To rain a shower of commanded tears,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>An onion will do well for such a shift,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Which in a napkin being close convey'd</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Anon I'll give thee more instructions.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit a Servingman</em></p>
<span id='131'>I know the boy will well usurp the grace,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:</span><br/>
<span id='133'>I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And how my men will stay themselves from laughter</span><br/>
<span id='135'>When they do homage to this simple peasant.</span><br/>
<span id='136'>I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence</span><br/>
<span id='137'>May well abate the over-merry spleen</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Which otherwise would grow into extremes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

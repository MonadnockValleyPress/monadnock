<h1>Macbeth</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Forres. The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter BANQUO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>As the weird women promised, and, I fear,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said</span><br/>
<span id='4'>It should not stand in thy posterity,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>But that myself should be the root and father</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Of many kings. If there come truth from them&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Why, by the verities on thee made good,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>May they not be my oracles as well,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.</span><br/>
<p><em>Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY  MACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Here's our chief guest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>If he had been forgotten,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>It had been as a gap in our great feast,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And all-thing unbecoming.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And I'll request your presence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Let your highness</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Command upon me; to the which my duties</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Are with a most indissoluble tie</span><br/>
<span id='20'>For ever knit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>                  Ride you this afternoon?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Ay, my good lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>We should have else desired your good advice,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Is't far you ride?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>As far, my lord, as will fill up the time</span><br/>
<span id='28'>'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>I must become a borrower of the night</span><br/>
<span id='30'>For a dark hour or twain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Fail not our feast.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>My lord, I will not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd</span><br/>
<span id='34'>In England and in Ireland, not confessing</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers</span><br/>
<span id='36'>With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>When therewithal we shall have cause of state</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit BANQUO</em></p>
<span id='43'>Let every man be master of his time</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Till seven at night: to make society</span><br/>
<span id='45'>The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant</em></p>
<span id='47'>Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Our pleasure?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ATTENDANT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>They are, my lord, without the palace gate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Bring them before us.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Attendant</em></p>
<span id='51'>To be thus is nothing;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>But to be safely thus.&mdash;Our fears in Banquo</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour</span><br/>
<span id='57'>To act in safety. There is none but he</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Whose being I do fear: and, under him,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters</span><br/>
<span id='61'>When first they put the name of king upon me,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like</span><br/>
<span id='63'>They hail'd him father to a line of kings:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>No son of mine succeeding. If't be so,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Put rancours in the vessel of my peace</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Only for them; and mine eternal jewel</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Given to the common enemy of man,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Rather than so, come fate into the list.</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers</em></p>
<span id='76'>Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Attendant</em></p>
<span id='77'>Was it not yesterday we spoke together?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>It was, so please your highness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Well then, now</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know</span><br/>
<span id='81'>That it was he in the times past which held you</span><br/>
<span id='82'>So under fortune, which you thought had been</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Our innocent self: this I made good to you</span><br/>
<span id='84'>In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>the instruments,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Who wrought with them, and all things else that might</span><br/>
<span id='88'>To half a soul and to a notion crazed</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Say 'Thus did Banquo.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>You made it known to us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>I did so, and went further, which is now</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Our point of second meeting. Do you find</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Your patience so predominant in your nature</span><br/>
<span id='94'>That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd</span><br/>
<span id='95'>To pray for this good man and for his issue,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And beggar'd yours for ever?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>We are men, my liege.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept</span><br/>
<span id='102'>All by the name of dogs: the valued file</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>The housekeeper, the hunter, every one</span><br/>
<span id='105'>According to the gift which bounteous nature</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Particular addition. from the bill</span><br/>
<span id='108'>That writes them all alike: and so of men.</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Now, if you have a station in the file,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say't;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And I will put that business in your bosoms,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Whose execution takes your enemy off,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Grapples you to the heart and love of us,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Who wear our health but sickly in his life,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Which in his death were perfect.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I am one, my liege,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Have so incensed that I am reckless what</span><br/>
<span id='119'>I do to spite the world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>And I another</span><br/>
<span id='121'>So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>That I would set my lie on any chance,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>To mend it, or be rid on't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Both of you</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Know Banquo was your enemy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Both Murderers</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>True, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>That every minute of his being thrusts</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Against my near'st of life: and though I could</span><br/>
<span id='130'>With barefaced power sweep him from my sight</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>For certain friends that are both his and mine,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>That I to your assistance do make love,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Masking the business from the common eye</span><br/>
<span id='137'>For sundry weighty reasons.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>We shall, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Perform what you command us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Though our lives&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most</span><br/>
<span id='142'>I will advise you where to plant yourselves;</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And something from the palace; always thought</span><br/>
<span id='146'>That I require a clearness: and with him&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='147'>To leave no rubs nor botches in the work&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Fleance his son, that keeps him company,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Whose absence is no less material to me</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Than is his father's, must embrace the fate</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:</span><br/>
<span id='152'>I'll come to you anon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Both Murderers</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>We are resolved, my lord.</span><br/>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>I'll call upon you straight: abide within.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Murderers</em></p>
<span id='155'>It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.</span><br/>

<h1>The Merchant of Venice</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</H3>
<h4>Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter PORTIA and NERISSA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of</span><br/>
<span id='2'>this great world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in</span><br/>
<span id='4'>the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and</span><br/>
<span id='5'>yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit</span><br/>
<span id='6'>with too much as they that starve with nothing. It</span><br/>
<span id='7'>is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the</span><br/>
<span id='8'>mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but</span><br/>
<span id='9'>competency lives longer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Good sentences and well pronounced.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>They would be better, if well followed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>If to do were as easy as to know what were good to</span><br/>
<span id='13'>do, chapels had been churches and poor men's</span><br/>
<span id='14'>cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that</span><br/>
<span id='15'>follows his own instructions: I can easier teach</span><br/>
<span id='16'>twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the</span><br/>
<span id='17'>twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may</span><br/>
<span id='18'>devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps</span><br/>
<span id='19'>o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the</span><br/>
<span id='20'>youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the</span><br/>
<span id='21'>cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to</span><br/>
<span id='22'>choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may</span><br/>
<span id='23'>neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I</span><br/>
<span id='24'>dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed</span><br/>
<span id='25'>by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their</span><br/>
<span id='28'>death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning</span><br/>
<span id='31'>chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any</span><br/>
<span id='32'>rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what</span><br/>
<span id='33'>warmth is there in your affection towards any of</span><br/>
<span id='34'>these princely suitors that are already come?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest</span><br/>
<span id='36'>them, I will describe them; and, according to my</span><br/>
<span id='37'>description, level at my affection.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>First, there is the Neapolitan prince.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but</span><br/>
<span id='40'>talk of his horse; and he makes it a great</span><br/>
<span id='41'>appropriation to his own good parts, that he can</span><br/>
<span id='42'>shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his</span><br/>
<span id='43'>mother played false with a smith.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Then there is the County Palatine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you</span><br/>
<span id='46'>will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and</span><br/>
<span id='47'>smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping</span><br/>
<span id='48'>philosopher when he grows old, being so full of</span><br/>
<span id='49'>unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be</span><br/>
<span id='50'>married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth</span><br/>
<span id='51'>than to either of these. God defend me from these</span><br/>
<span id='52'>two!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>he! why, he hath a horse better than the</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than</span><br/>
<span id='58'>the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a</span><br/>
<span id='59'>throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will</span><br/>
<span id='60'>fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I</span><br/>
<span id='61'>should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me</span><br/>
<span id='62'>I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I</span><br/>
<span id='63'>shall never requite him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron</span><br/>
<span id='65'>of England?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>You know I say nothing to him, for he understands</span><br/>
<span id='67'>not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>nor Italian, and you will come into the court and</span><br/>
<span id='69'>swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can</span><br/>
<span id='71'>converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!</span><br/>
<span id='72'>I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round</span><br/>
<span id='73'>hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his</span><br/>
<span id='74'>behavior every where.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he</span><br/>
<span id='77'>borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and</span><br/>
<span id='78'>swore he would pay him again when he was able: I</span><br/>
<span id='79'>think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed</span><br/>
<span id='80'>under for another.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and</span><br/>
<span id='83'>most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when</span><br/>
<span id='84'>he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and</span><br/>
<span id='85'>when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall</span><br/>
<span id='87'>make shift to go without him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>If he should offer to choose, and choose the right</span><br/>
<span id='89'>casket, you should refuse to perform your father's</span><br/>
<span id='90'>will, if you should refuse to accept him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a</span><br/>
<span id='92'>deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>for if the devil be within and that temptation</span><br/>
<span id='94'>without, I know he will choose it. I will do any</span><br/>
<span id='95'>thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>You need not fear, lady, the having any of these</span><br/>
<span id='97'>lords: they have acquainted me with their</span><br/>
<span id='98'>determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their</span><br/>
<span id='99'>home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless</span><br/>
<span id='100'>you may be won by some other sort than your father's</span><br/>
<span id='101'>imposition depending on the caskets.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as</span><br/>
<span id='103'>chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner</span><br/>
<span id='104'>of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers</span><br/>
<span id='105'>are so reasonable, for there is not one among them</span><br/>
<span id='106'>but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant</span><br/>
<span id='107'>them a fair departure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither</span><br/>
<span id='110'>in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish</span><br/>
<span id='113'>eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of</span><br/>
<span id='115'>thy praise.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Serving-man</em></p>
<span id='116'>How now! what news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take</span><br/>
<span id='118'>their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a</span><br/>
<span id='119'>fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the</span><br/>
<span id='120'>prince his master will be here to-night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a</span><br/>
<span id='122'>heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should</span><br/>
<span id='123'>be glad of his approach: if he have the condition</span><br/>
<span id='124'>of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had</span><br/>
<span id='125'>rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Whiles we shut the gates</span><br/>
<span id='128'>upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Henry VI, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Fields between Dartford and Blackheath.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter YORK, and his army of Irish, with drum and colours</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Ring, bells, aloud; burn, bonfires, clear and bright,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To entertain great England's lawful king.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Ah! sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear?</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Let them obey that know not how to rule;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>This hand was made to handle naught but gold.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>I cannot give due action to my words,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Except a sword or sceptre balance it:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BUCKINGHAM</em></p>
<span id='12'>Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The king hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>To know the reason of these arms in peace;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Or why thou, being a subject as I am,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Should raise so great a power without his leave,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>[Aside]  Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>I am so angry at these abject terms;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And now, like Ajax Telamonius,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I am far better born than is the king,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But I must make fair weather yet a while,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Till Henry be more weak and I more strong,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>That I have given no answer all this while;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>The cause why I have brought this army hither</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Seditious to his grace and to the state.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>That is too much presumption on thy part:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>But if thy arms be to no other end,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>The king hath yielded unto thy demand:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Meet me to-morrow in St. George's field,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>You shall have pay and every thing you wish.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>As pledges of my fealty and love;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>I'll send them all as willing as I live:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Lands, goods, horse, armour, any thing I have,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Is his to use, so Somerset may die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>York, I commend this kind submission:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>We twain will go into his highness' tent.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter KING HENRY VI and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>In all submission and humility</span><br/>
<span id='59'>York doth present himself unto your highness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Who since I heard to be discomfited.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter IDEN, with CADE'S head</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>IDEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>If one so rude and of so mean condition</span><br/>
<span id='65'>May pass into the presence of a king,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Lo, I present your grace a traitor's head,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou!</span><br/>
<span id='69'>O, let me view his visage, being dead,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>IDEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>I was, an't like your majesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>How art thou call'd? and what is thy degree?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>IDEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Alexander Iden, that's my name;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss</span><br/>
<span id='77'>He were created knight for his good service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Iden, kneel down.</span><br/>
<p><em>He kneels</em></p>
<span id='79'>Rise up a knight.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>We give thee for reward a thousand marks,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And will that thou henceforth attend on us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>IDEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>May Iden live to merit such a bounty.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And never live but true unto his liege!</span><br/>
<p><em>Rises</em></p>
<p><em>Enter QUEEN MARGARET and SOMERSET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>See, Buckingham, Somerset comes with the queen:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Go, bid her hide him quickly from the duke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>But boldly stand and front him to his face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>How now! is Somerset at liberty?</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Then, York, unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?</span><br/>
<span id='92'>False king! why hast thou broken faith with me,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?</span><br/>
<span id='94'>King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Which darest not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.</span><br/>
<span id='97'>That head of thine doth not become a crown;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Is able with the change to kill and cure.</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And with the same to act controlling laws.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no more</span><br/>
<span id='106'>O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Obey, audacious traitor; kneel for grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Wouldst have me kneel? first let me ask of these,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>If they can brook I bow a knee to man.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Attendant</em></p>
<span id='113'>I know, ere they will have me go to ward,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Call hither Clifford! bid him come amain,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>To say if that the bastard boys of York</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Shall be the surety for their traitor father.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit BUCKINGHAM</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>O blood-besotted Neapolitan,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Outcast of Naples, England's bloody scourge!</span><br/>
<span id='120'>The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Shall be their father's bail; and bane to those</span><br/>
<span id='122'>That for my surety will refuse the boys!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter EDWARD and RICHARD</em></p>
<span id='123'>See where they come: I'll warrant they'll</span><br/>
<span id='124'>make it good.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CLIFFORD and YOUNG CLIFFORD</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Health and all happiness to my lord the king!</span><br/>
<p><em>Kneels</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>I thank thee, Clifford: say, what news with thee?</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Nay, do not fright us with an angry look;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>This is my king, York, I do not mistake;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>But thou mistakest me much to think I do:</span><br/>
<span id='133'>To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Makes him oppose himself against his king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>He is a traitor; let him to the Tower,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>And chop away that factious pate of his.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>He is arrested, but will not obey;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Will you not, sons?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>EDWARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>And if words will not, then our weapons shall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Look in a glass, and call thy image so:</span><br/>
<span id='145'>I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor.</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>That with the very shaking of their chains</span><br/>
<span id='148'>They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the WARWICK and SALISBURY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Are these thy bears? we'll bait thy bears to death.</span><br/>
<span id='151'>And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>If thou darest bring them to the baiting place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Oft have I seen a hot o'erweening cur</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Run back and bite, because he was withheld;</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Who, being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried:</span><br/>
<span id='157'>And such a piece of service will you do,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son!</span><br/>
<span id='166'>What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?</span><br/>
<span id='168'>O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?</span><br/>
<span id='169'>If it be banish'd from the frosty head,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Where shall it find a harbour in the earth?</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And shame thine honourable age with blood?</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Why art thou old, and want'st experience?</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?</span><br/>
<span id='175'>For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me</span><br/>
<span id='176'>That bows unto the grave with mickle age.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>My lord, I have consider'd with myself</span><br/>
<span id='178'>The title of this most renowned duke;</span><br/>
<span id='179'>And in my conscience do repute his grace</span><br/>
<span id='180'>The rightful heir to England's royal seat.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>I have.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>It is great sin to swear unto a sin,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Who can be bound by any solemn vow</span><br/>
<span id='187'>To do a murderous deed, to rob a man,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>To force a spotless virgin's chastity,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>To reave the orphan of his patrimony,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>To wring the widow from her custom'd right,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>And have no other reason for this wrong</span><br/>
<span id='192'>But that he was bound by a solemn oath?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>A subtle traitor needs no sophister.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>I am resolved for death or dignity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>You were best to go to bed and dream again,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>To keep thee from the tempest of the field.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>I am resolved to bear a greater storm</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Than any thou canst conjure up to-day;</span><br/>
<span id='202'>And that I'll write upon thy burgonet,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Might I but know thee by thy household badge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>As on a mountain top the cedar shows</span><br/>
<span id='208'>That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Even to affright thee with the view thereof.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear</span><br/>
<span id='211'>And tread it under foot with all contempt,</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>YOUNG CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='213'>And so to arms, victorious father,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>To quell the rebels and their complices.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='215'>Fie! charity, for shame! speak not in spite,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>YOUNG CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>

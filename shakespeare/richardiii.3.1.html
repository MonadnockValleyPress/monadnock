<h1>Richard III</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>London. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>The trumpets sound. Enter the young PRINCE EDWARD, GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, CARDINAL, CATESBY, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign</span><br/>
<span id='3'>The weary way hath made you melancholy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>No, uncle; but our crosses on the way</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy</span><br/>
<span id='6'>I want more uncles here to welcome me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Nor more can you distinguish of a man</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Those uncles which you want were dangerous;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :</span><br/>
<span id='15'>God keep you from them, and from such false friends!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>God keep me from false friends! but they were none.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the Lord Mayor and his train</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Lord Mayor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>God bless your grace with health and happy days!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.</span><br/>
<span id='20'>I thought my mother, and my brother York,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Would long ere this have met us on the way</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To tell us whether they will come or no!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HASTINGS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>On what occasion, God he knows, not I,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>The queen your mother, and your brother York,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But by his mother was perforce withheld.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Fie, what an indirect and peevish course</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Unto his princely brother presently?</span><br/>
<span id='35'>If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Can from his mother win the Duke of York,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate</span><br/>
<span id='40'>To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid</span><br/>
<span id='41'>We should infringe the holy privilege</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>You are too senseless&mdash;obstinate, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Too ceremonious and traditional</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>You break not sanctuary in seizing him.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The benefit thereof is always granted</span><br/>
<span id='49'>To those whose dealings have deserved the place,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And those who have the wit to claim the place:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Then, taking him from thence that is not there,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>You break no privilege nor charter there.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>But sanctuary children ne'er till now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>I go, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS</em></p>
<span id='61'>Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Where it seems best unto your royal self.</span><br/>
<span id='64'>If I may counsel you, some day or two</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit</span><br/>
<span id='67'>For your best health and recreation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>I do not like the Tower, of any place.</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Is it upon record, or else reported</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Successively from age to age, he built it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Upon record, my gracious lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>But say, my lord, it were not register'd,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Methinks the truth should live from age to age,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Even to the general all-ending day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>[Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do never</span><br/>
<span id='80'>live long.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>What say you, uncle?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>I say, without characters, fame lives long.</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='83'>Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>I moralize two meanings in one word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>That Julius Caesar was a famous man;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>With what his valour did enrich his wit,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>His wit set down to make his valour live</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>For now he lives in fame, though not in life.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>What, my gracious lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>An if I live until I be a man,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>I'll win our ancient right in France again,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>[Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward spring.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter young YORK, HASTINGS, and the CARDINAL</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Too late he died that might have kept that title,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Which by his death hath lost much majesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>You said that idle weeds are fast in growth</span><br/>
<span id='105'>The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>He hath, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>                  And therefore is he idle?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Then is he more beholding to you than I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>He may command me as my sovereign;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>But you have power in me as in a kinsman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>A beggar, brother?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>A gentle cousin, were it light enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>It is too heavy for your grace to wear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>What, would you have my weapon, little lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>I would, that I might thank you as you call me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>How?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Little.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Because that I am little, like an ape,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!</span><br/>
<span id='135'>To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>He prettily and aptly taunts himself:</span><br/>
<span id='137'>So cunning and so young is wonderful.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>My lord, will't please you pass along?</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Myself and my good cousin Buckingham</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Will to your mother, to entreat of her</span><br/>
<span id='141'>To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>My lord protector needs will have it so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Why, what should you fear?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:</span><br/>
<span id='147'>My grandam told me he was murdered there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>I fear no uncles dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Nor none that live, I hope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>An if they live, I hope I need not fear.</span><br/>
<span id='151'>But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.</span><br/>
<p><em>A Sennet. Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM and CATESBY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Think you, my lord, this little prating York</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Was not incensed by his subtle mother</span><br/>
<span id='155'>To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable</span><br/>
<span id='158'>He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend</span><br/>
<span id='161'>As closely to conceal what we impart:</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;</span><br/>
<span id='163'>What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter</span><br/>
<span id='164'>To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>For the instalment of this noble duke</span><br/>
<span id='166'>In the seat royal of this famous isle?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>CATESBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>He for his father's sake so loves the prince,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>That he will not be won to aught against him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>CATESBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>He will do all in all as Hastings doth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>How doth he stand affected to our purpose;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>To sit about the coronation.</span><br/>
<span id='176'>If thou dost find him tractable to us,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:</span><br/>
<span id='178'>If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>And give us notice of his inclination:</span><br/>
<span id='181'>For we to-morrow hold divided councils,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries</span><br/>
<span id='185'>To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;</span><br/>
<span id='186'>And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>CATESBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>My good lords both, with all the heed I may.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>CATESBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>You shall, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit CATESBY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:</span><br/>
<span id='196'>And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me</span><br/>
<span id='197'>The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>And look to have it yielded with all willingness.</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards</span><br/>
<span id='202'>We may digest our complots in some form.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<em>Enter VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA	they set them down on two low stools, and sew</em>

<span id='speech1'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a</span><br/>
<span id='2'>more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I</span><br/>
<span id='3'>should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he</span><br/>
<span id='4'>won honour than in the embracements of his bed where</span><br/>
<span id='5'>he would show most love. When yet he was but</span><br/>
<span id='6'>tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when</span><br/>
<span id='7'>youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when</span><br/>
<span id='8'>for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not</span><br/>
<span id='9'>sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering</span><br/>
<span id='10'>how honour would become such a person. that it was</span><br/>
<span id='11'>no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if</span><br/>
<span id='12'>renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek</span><br/>
<span id='13'>danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel</span><br/>
<span id='14'>war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows</span><br/>
<span id='15'>bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not</span><br/>
<span id='16'>more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child</span><br/>
<span id='17'>than now in first seeing he had proved himself a</span><br/>
<span id='18'>man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>But had he died in the business, madam; how then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Then his good report should have been my son; I</span><br/>
<span id='21'>therein would have found issue. Hear me profess</span><br/>
<span id='22'>sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love</span><br/>
<span id='23'>alike and none less dear than thine and my good</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their</span><br/>
<span id='25'>country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Gentlewoman</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Gentlewoman</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Indeed, you shall not.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow</span><br/>
<span id='35'>With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Or all or lose his hire.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Away, you fool! it more becomes a man</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood</span><br/>
<span id='43'>At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>We are fit to bid her welcome.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Gentlewoman</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And tread upon his neck.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter VALERIA, with an Usher and Gentlewoman</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>VALERIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>My ladies both, good day to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Sweet madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>I am glad to see your ladyship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>VALERIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good</span><br/>
<span id='53'>faith. How does your little son?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than</span><br/>
<span id='56'>look upon his school-master.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>VALERIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a</span><br/>
<span id='58'>very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Wednesday half an hour together: has such a</span><br/>
<span id='60'>confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded</span><br/>
<span id='61'>butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go</span><br/>
<span id='62'>again; and after it again; and over and over he</span><br/>
<span id='63'>comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his</span><br/>
<span id='64'>fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his</span><br/>
<span id='65'>teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked</span><br/>
<span id='66'>it!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>One on 's father's moods.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>VALERIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>A crack, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>VALERIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play</span><br/>
<span id='71'>the idle husewife with me this afternoon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>No, good madam; I will not out of doors.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>VALERIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Not out of doors!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>She shall, she shall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the</span><br/>
<span id='76'>threshold till my lord return from the wars.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>VALERIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>you must go visit the good lady that lies in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with</span><br/>
<span id='80'>my prayers; but I cannot go thither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Why, I pray you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>VALERIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all</span><br/>
<span id='84'>the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric</span><br/>
<span id='86'>were sensible as your finger, that you might leave</span><br/>
<span id='87'>pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>VALERIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you</span><br/>
<span id='90'>excellent news of your husband.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>O, good madam, there can be none yet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>VALERIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from</span><br/>
<span id='93'>him last night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Indeed, madam?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>VALERIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against</span><br/>
<span id='97'>whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of</span><br/>
<span id='98'>our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set</span><br/>
<span id='99'>down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt</span><br/>
<span id='100'>prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every</span><br/>
<span id='103'>thing hereafter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>VOLUMNIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but</span><br/>
<span id='105'>disease our better mirth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>VALERIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy</span><br/>
<span id='108'>solemness out o' door. and go along with us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>VIRGILIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish</span><br/>
<span id='110'>you much mirth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>VALERIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Well, then, farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

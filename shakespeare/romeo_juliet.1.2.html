<h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</H3>
<h4>A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>But Montague is bound as well as I,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>For men so old as we to keep the peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PARIS</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Of honourable reckoning are you both;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>But saying o'er what I have said before:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>My child is yet a stranger in the world;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Let two more summers wither in their pride,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PARIS</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Younger than she are happy mothers made.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>And too soon marr'd are those so early made.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>She is the hopeful lady of my earth:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>My will to her consent is but a part;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>An she agree, within her scope of choice</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Lies my consent and fair according voice.</span><br/>
<span id='20'>This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Whereto I have invited many a guest,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Such as I love; and you, among the store,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>One more, most welcome, makes my number more.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>At my poor house look to behold this night</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Such comfort as do lusty young men feel</span><br/>
<span id='27'>When well-apparell'd April on the heel</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Of limping winter treads, even such delight</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Among fresh female buds shall you this night</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And like her most whose merit most shall be:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Which on more view, of many mine being one</span><br/>
<span id='33'>May stand in number, though in reckoning none,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Come, go with me.</span><br/>
<p><em>To Servant, giving a paper</em></p>
<span id='35'>Go, sirrah, trudge about</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Through fair Verona; find those persons out</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Whose names are written there, and to them say,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Servant</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Find them out whose names are written here! It is</span><br/>
<span id='40'>written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his</span><br/>
<span id='41'>yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with</span><br/>
<span id='42'>his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am</span><br/>
<span id='43'>sent to find those persons whose names are here</span><br/>
<span id='44'>writ, and can never find what names the writing</span><br/>
<span id='45'>person hath here writ. I must to the learned.&mdash;In good time.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>One desperate grief cures with another's languish:</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Take thou some new infection to thy eye,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And the rank poison of the old will die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>For what, I pray thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>For your broken shin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Why, Romeo, art thou mad?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Shut up in prison, kept without my food,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Whipp'd and tormented and&mdash;God-den, good fellow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Servant</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Servant</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I</span><br/>
<span id='62'>pray, can you read any thing you see?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Ay, if I know the letters and the language.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Servant</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Ye say honestly: rest you merry!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Stay, fellow; I can read.</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='66'>'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady</span><br/>
<span id='68'>widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely</span><br/>
<span id='69'>nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine</span><br/>
<span id='70'>uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair</span><br/>
<span id='73'>assembly: whither should they come?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Servant</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Whither?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Servant</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>To supper; to our house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Whose house?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Servant</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>My master's.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Servant</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the</span><br/>
<span id='81'>great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house</span><br/>
<span id='82'>of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Rest you merry!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>At this same ancient feast of Capulet's</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>With all the admired beauties of Verona:</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Compare her face with some that I shall show,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>When the devout religion of mine eye</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And these, who often drown'd could never die,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!</span><br/>
<span id='94'>One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Herself poised with herself in either eye:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Your lady's love against some other maid</span><br/>
<span id='100'>That I will show you shining at this feast,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And she shall scant show well that now shows best.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

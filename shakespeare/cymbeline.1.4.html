<h1>Cymbeline</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Rome. Philario's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a Dutchman, and a Spaniard</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was</span><br/>
<span id='2'>then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy</span><br/>
<span id='3'>as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I</span><br/>
<span id='4'>could then have looked on him without the help of</span><br/>
<span id='5'>admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments</span><br/>
<span id='6'>had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PHILARIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>You speak of him when he was less furnished than now</span><br/>
<span id='8'>he is with that which makes him both without and within.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Frenchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>I have seen him in France: we had very many there</span><br/>
<span id='10'>could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein</span><br/>
<span id='12'>he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Frenchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>And then his banishment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this</span><br/>
<span id='16'>lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully</span><br/>
<span id='17'>to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>which else an easy battery might lay flat, for</span><br/>
<span id='19'>taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes</span><br/>
<span id='20'>it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps</span><br/>
<span id='21'>acquaintance?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PHILARIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I</span><br/>
<span id='23'>have been often bound for no less than my life.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained</span><br/>
<span id='25'>amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your</span><br/>
<span id='26'>knowing, to a stranger of his quality.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</em></p>
<span id='27'>I beseech you all, be better known to this</span><br/>
<span id='28'>gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend</span><br/>
<span id='29'>of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear</span><br/>
<span id='30'>hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Frenchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Sir, we have known together in Orleans.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Frenchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I</span><br/>
<span id='35'>did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity</span><br/>
<span id='36'>you should have been put together with so mortal a</span><br/>
<span id='37'>purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so</span><br/>
<span id='38'>slight and trivial a nature.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in</span><br/>
<span id='41'>my every action to be guided by others' experiences:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>but upon my mended judgment&mdash;if I offend not to say</span><br/>
<span id='43'>it is mended&mdash;my quarrel was not altogether slight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Frenchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>and by such two that would by all likelihood have</span><br/>
<span id='46'>confounded one the other, or have fallen both.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Frenchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>It was much like an argument that fell out last</span><br/>
<span id='51'>night, where each of us fell in praise of our</span><br/>
<span id='52'>country mistresses; this gentleman at that time</span><br/>
<span id='53'>vouching&mdash;and upon warrant of bloody</span><br/>
<span id='54'>affirmation&mdash;his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable</span><br/>
<span id='56'>than any the rarest of our ladies in France.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's</span><br/>
<span id='58'>opinion by this worn out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>She holds her virtue still and I my mind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would</span><br/>
<span id='62'>abate her nothing, though I profess myself her</span><br/>
<span id='63'>adorer, not her friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>As fair and as good&mdash;a kind of hand-in-hand</span><br/>
<span id='65'>comparison&mdash;had been something too fair and too good</span><br/>
<span id='66'>for any lady in Britain. If she went before others</span><br/>
<span id='67'>I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres</span><br/>
<span id='68'>many I have beheld. I could not but believe she</span><br/>
<span id='69'>excelled many: but I have not seen the most</span><br/>
<span id='70'>precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>What do you esteem it at?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>More than the world enjoys.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's</span><br/>
<span id='75'>outprized by a trifle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if</span><br/>
<span id='77'>there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit</span><br/>
<span id='78'>for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>and only the gift of the gods.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Which the gods have given you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Which, by their graces, I will keep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your</span><br/>
<span id='84'>ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable</span><br/>
<span id='85'>estimations; the one is but frail and the other</span><br/>
<span id='86'>casual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished</span><br/>
<span id='87'>courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier</span><br/>
<span id='89'>to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the</span><br/>
<span id='90'>holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do</span><br/>
<span id='91'>nothing doubt you have store of thieves;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>PHILARIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Let us leave here, gentlemen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I</span><br/>
<span id='95'>thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>With five times so much conversation, I should get</span><br/>
<span id='97'>ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even</span><br/>
<span id='98'>to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>No, no.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to</span><br/>
<span id='101'>your ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it</span><br/>
<span id='102'>something: but I make my wager rather against your</span><br/>
<span id='103'>confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your</span><br/>
<span id='104'>offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any</span><br/>
<span id='105'>lady in the world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>You are a great deal abused in too bold a</span><br/>
<span id='107'>persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you're</span><br/>
<span id='108'>worthy of by your attempt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>What's that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>deserve more; a punishment too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>PHILARIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;</span><br/>
<span id='113'>let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be</span><br/>
<span id='114'>better acquainted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the</span><br/>
<span id='116'>approbation of what I have spoke!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>What lady would you choose to assail?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.</span><br/>
<span id='119'>I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>that, commend me to the court where your lady is,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>with no more advantage than the opportunity of a</span><br/>
<span id='122'>second conference, and I will bring from thence</span><br/>
<span id='123'>that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring</span><br/>
<span id='125'>I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy</span><br/>
<span id='127'>ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot</span><br/>
<span id='128'>preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some</span><br/>
<span id='129'>religion in you, that you fear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a</span><br/>
<span id='131'>graver purpose, I hope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo</span><br/>
<span id='133'>what's spoken, I swear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your</span><br/>
<span id='135'>return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my</span><br/>
<span id='136'>mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your</span><br/>
<span id='137'>unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>PHILARIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>I will have it no lay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no</span><br/>
<span id='140'>sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest</span><br/>
<span id='141'>bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats</span><br/>
<span id='142'>are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are</span><br/>
<span id='145'>yours: provided I have your commendation for my more</span><br/>
<span id='146'>free entertainment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>I embrace these conditions; let us have articles</span><br/>
<span id='148'>betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if</span><br/>
<span id='149'>you make your voyage upon her and give me directly</span><br/>
<span id='150'>to understand you have prevailed, I am no further</span><br/>
<span id='151'>your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she</span><br/>
<span id='152'>remain unseduced, you not making it appear</span><br/>
<span id='153'>otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you</span><br/>
<span id='154'>have made to her chastity you shall answer me with</span><br/>
<span id='155'>your sword.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set</span><br/>
<span id='157'>down by lawful counsel, and straight away for</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and</span><br/>
<span id='159'>starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two</span><br/>
<span id='160'>wagers recorded.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>Agreed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and IACHIMO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>Frenchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Will this hold, think you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>PHILARIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Signior Iachimo will not from it.</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Pray, let us follow 'em.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

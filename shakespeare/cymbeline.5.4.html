<h1>Cymbeline</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>A British prison.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and two Gaolers</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Gaoler</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>You shall not now be stol'n, you have locks upon you;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>So graze as you find pasture.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Gaoler</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Ay, or a stomach.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Gaolers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>think, to liberty: yet am I better</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Than one that's sick o' the gout; since he had rather</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Groan so in perpetuity than be cured</span><br/>
<span id='8'>By the sure physician, death, who is the key</span><br/>
<span id='9'>To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd</span><br/>
<span id='10'>More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me</span><br/>
<span id='11'>The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?</span><br/>
<span id='13'>So children temporal fathers do appease;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?</span><br/>
<span id='15'>I cannot do it better than in gyves,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take</span><br/>
<span id='18'>No stricter render of me than my all.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I know you are more clement than vile men,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Who of their broken debtors take a third,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again</span><br/>
<span id='22'>On their abatement: that's not my desire:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though</span><br/>
<span id='24'>'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>You rather mine, being yours: and so, great powers,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>If you will take this audit, take this life,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!</span><br/>
<span id='30'>I'll speak to thee in silence.</span><br/>
<p><em>Sleeps</em></p>
<p><em>Solemn music. Enter, as in an apparition,  SICILIUS LEONATUS, father to Posthumus Leonatus,  an old man, attired like a warrior; leading in  his hand an ancient matron, his wife, and mother  to Posthumus Leonatus, with music before them:  then, after other music, follow the two young  Leonati, brothers to Posthumus Leonatus, with  wounds as they died in the wars. They circle Posthumus Leonatus round, as he lies sleeping</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Sicilius Leonatus</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>No more, thou thunder-master, show</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Thy spite on mortal flies:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>That thy adulteries</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Rates and revenges.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Hath my poor boy done aught but well,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Whose face I never saw?</span><br/>
<span id='38'>I died whilst in the womb he stay'd</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Attending nature's law:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Whose father then, as men report</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Thou orphans' father art,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him</span><br/>
<span id='43'>From this earth-vexing smart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Mother</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Lucina lent not me her aid,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>But took me in my throes;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>That from me was Posthumus ript,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Came crying 'mongst his foes,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>A thing of pity!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Sicilius Leonatus</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Great nature, like his ancestry,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Moulded the stuff so fair,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>That he deserved the praise o' the world,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>As great Sicilius' heir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>First Brother</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>When once he was mature for man,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>In Britain where was he</span><br/>
<span id='55'>That could stand up his parallel;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Or fruitful object be</span><br/>
<span id='57'>In eye of Imogen, that best</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Could deem his dignity?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Mother</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>With marriage wherefore was he mock'd,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>To be exiled, and thrown</span><br/>
<span id='61'>From Leonati seat, and cast</span><br/>
<span id='62'>From her his dearest one,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Sweet Imogen?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Sicilius Leonatus</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Why did you suffer Iachimo,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Slight thing of Italy,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>To taint his nobler heart and brain</span><br/>
<span id='67'>With needless jealosy;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And to become the geck and scorn</span><br/>
<span id='69'>O' th' other's villany?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Second Brother</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>For this from stiller seats we came,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Our parents and us twain,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>That striking in our country's cause</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Fell bravely and were slain,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Our fealty and Tenantius' right</span><br/>
<span id='75'>With honour to maintain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>First Brother</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Like hardiment Posthumus hath</span><br/>
<span id='77'>To Cymbeline perform'd:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Why hast thou thus adjourn'd</span><br/>
<span id='80'>The graces for his merits due,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Being all to dolours turn'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Sicilius Leonatus</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Thy crystal window ope; look out;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>No longer exercise</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Upon a valiant race thy harsh</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And potent injuries.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Mother</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Since, Jupiter, our son is good,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Take off his miseries.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Sicilius Leonatus</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Peep through thy marble mansion; help;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Or we poor ghosts will cry</span><br/>
<span id='90'>To the shining synod of the rest</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Against thy deity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Brother</strong></span>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Second Brother</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Help, Jupiter; or we appeal,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And from thy justice fly.</span><br/>
<p><em>Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting  upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The Apparitions fall on their knees</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Jupiter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>No more, you petty spirits of region low,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Accuse the thunderer, whose bolt, you know,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and rest</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Upon your never-withering banks of flowers:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Be not with mortal accidents opprest;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and in</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>He shall be lord of lady Imogen,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And happier much by his affliction made.</span><br/>
<span id='110'>This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>and so, away: no further with your din</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.</span><br/>
<p><em>Ascends</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Sicilius Leonatus</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>He came in thunder; his celestial breath</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Was sulphurous to smell: the holy eagle</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Stoop'd as to foot us: his ascension is</span><br/>
<span id='118'>More sweet than our blest fields: his royal bird</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>As when his god is pleased.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Thanks, Jupiter!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Sicilius Leonatus</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>The marble pavement closes, he is enter'd</span><br/>
<span id='123'>His radiant root. Away! and, to be blest,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Let us with care perform his great behest.</span><br/>
<p><em>The Apparitions vanish</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Posthumus Leonatus</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>[Waking]  Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begot</span><br/>
<span id='126'>A father to me; and thou hast created</span><br/>
<span id='127'>A mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend</span><br/>
<span id='130'>On greatness' favour dream as I have done,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve:</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Many dream not to find, neither deserve,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And yet are steep'd in favours: so am I,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>That have this golden chance and know not why.</span><br/>
<span id='135'>What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Nobler than that it covers: let thy effects</span><br/>
<span id='138'>So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>As good as promise.</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='140'>'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of</span><br/>
<span id='142'>tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be</span><br/>
<span id='143'>lopped branches, which, being dead many years,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock and</span><br/>
<span id='145'>freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.'</span><br/>
<span id='147'>'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing;</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Or senseless speaking or a speaking such</span><br/>
<span id='150'>As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>The action of my life is like it, which</span><br/>
<span id='152'>I'll keep, if but for sympathy.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter First Gaoler</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>First Gaoler</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Come, sir, are you ready for death?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>First Gaoler</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>Hanging is the word, sir: if</span><br/>
<span id='156'>you be ready for that, you are well cooked.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>So, if I prove a good repast to the</span><br/>
<span id='158'>spectators, the dish pays the shot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>First Gaoler</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>you shall be called to no more payments, fear no</span><br/>
<span id='161'>more tavern-bills; which are often the sadness of</span><br/>
<span id='162'>parting, as the procuring of mirth: you come in</span><br/>
<span id='163'>flint for want of meat, depart reeling with too</span><br/>
<span id='164'>much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and</span><br/>
<span id='165'>sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain</span><br/>
<span id='166'>both empty; the brain the heavier for being too</span><br/>
<span id='167'>light, the purse too light, being drawn of</span><br/>
<span id='168'>heaviness: of this contradiction you shall now be</span><br/>
<span id='169'>quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up</span><br/>
<span id='170'>thousands in a trice: you have no true debitor and</span><br/>
<span id='171'>creditor but it; of what's past, is, and to come,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>the discharge: your neck, sir, is pen, book and</span><br/>
<span id='173'>counters; so the acquittance follows.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>I am merrier to die than thou art to live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>First Gaoler</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the</span><br/>
<span id='176'>tooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep your</span><br/>
<span id='177'>sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he</span><br/>
<span id='178'>would change places with his officer; for, look you,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>sir, you know not which way you shall go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Yes, indeed do I, fellow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>First Gaoler</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>Your death has eyes in 's head then; I have not seen</span><br/>
<span id='182'>him so pictured: you must either be directed by</span><br/>
<span id='183'>some that take upon them to know, or do take upon</span><br/>
<span id='184'>yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or</span><br/>
<span id='185'>jump the after inquiry on your own peril: and how</span><br/>
<span id='186'>you shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'll</span><br/>
<span id='187'>never return to tell one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to</span><br/>
<span id='189'>direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and</span><br/>
<span id='190'>will not use them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>First Gaoler</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>What an infinite mock is this, that a man should</span><br/>
<span id='192'>have the best use of eyes to see the way of</span><br/>
<span id='193'>blindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>Thou bring'st good news; I am called to be made free.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>First Gaoler</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>I'll be hang'd then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>First Gaoler</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young</span><br/>
<span id='199'>gibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my</span><br/>
<span id='200'>conscience, there are verier knaves desire to live,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>for all he be a Roman: and there be some of them</span><br/>
<span id='202'>too that die against their wills; so should I, if I</span><br/>
<span id='203'>were one. I would we were all of one mind, and one</span><br/>
<span id='204'>mind good; O, there were desolation of gaolers and</span><br/>
<span id='205'>gallowses! I speak against my present profit, but</span><br/>
<span id='206'>my wish hath a preferment in 't.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

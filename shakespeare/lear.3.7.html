<h1>King Lear</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene VII</h3>
<h4>Gloucester's castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GONERIL, EDMUND, and Servants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Post speedily to my lord your husband; show him</span><br/>
<span id='2'>this letter: the army of France is landed. Seek</span><br/>
<span id='3'>out the villain Gloucester.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt some of the Servants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Hang him instantly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Pluck out his eyes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our</span><br/>
<span id='7'>sister company: the revenges we are bound to take</span><br/>
<span id='8'>upon your traitorous father are not fit for your</span><br/>
<span id='9'>beholding. Advise the duke, where you are going, to</span><br/>
<span id='10'>a most festinate preparation: we are bound to the</span><br/>
<span id='11'>like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent</span><br/>
<span id='12'>betwixt us. Farewell, dear sister: farewell, my</span><br/>
<span id='13'>lord of Gloucester.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter OSWALD</em></p>
<span id='14'>How now! where's the king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Some five or six and thirty of his knights,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Who, with some other of the lords dependants,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Are gone with him towards Dover; where they boast</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To have well-armed friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Get horses for your mistress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Edmund, farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt GONERIL, EDMUND, and OSWALD</em></p>
<span id='24'>Go seek the traitor Gloucester,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt other Servants</em></p>
<span id='26'>Though well we may not pass upon his life</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Without the form of justice, yet our power</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men</span><br/>
<span id='29'>May blame, but not control. Who's there? the traitor?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GLOUCESTER, brought in by two or three</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Bind fast his corky arms.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>What mean your graces? Good my friends, consider</span><br/>
<span id='33'>You are my guests: do me no foul play, friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Bind him, I say.</span><br/>
<p><em>Servants bind him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>                  Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>REGAN plucks his beard</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To pluck me by the beard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>So white, and such a traitor!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Naughty lady,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>These hairs, which thou dost ravish from my chin,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Will quicken, and accuse thee: I am your host:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>With robbers' hands my hospitable favours</span><br/>
<span id='45'>You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Be simple answerer, for we know the truth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>And what confederacy have you with the traitors</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Late footed in the kingdom?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king? Speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>I have a letter guessingly set down,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And not from one opposed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Cunning.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>And false.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Where hast thou sent the king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>To Dover.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Wherefore to Dover, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Because I would not see thy cruel nails</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister</span><br/>
<span id='64'>In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>The sea, with such a storm as his bare head</span><br/>
<span id='66'>In hell-black night endured, would have buoy'd up,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And quench'd the stelled fires:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.</span><br/>
<span id='69'>If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Thou shouldst have said 'Good porter, turn the key,'</span><br/>
<span id='71'>All cruels else subscribed: but I shall see</span><br/>
<span id='72'>The winged vengeance overtake such children.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>He that will think to live till he be old,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Give me some help! O cruel! O you gods!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>One side will mock another; the other too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>If you see vengeance,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>First Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Hold your hand, my lord:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I have served you ever since I was a child;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>But better service have I never done you</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Than now to bid you hold.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>How now, you dog!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>First Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>If you did wear a beard upon your chin,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>I'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>My villain!</span><br/>
<p><em>They draw and fight</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>First Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!</span><br/>
<p><em>Takes a sword, and runs at him behind</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>First Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left</span><br/>
<span id='90'>To see some mischief on him. O!</span><br/>
<p><em>Dies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Where is thy lustre now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>To quit this horrid act.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Out, treacherous villain!</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was he</span><br/>
<span id='98'>That made the overture of thy treasons to us;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Who is too good to pity thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>O my follies! then Edgar was abused.</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell</span><br/>
<span id='103'>His way to Dover.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit one with GLOUCESTER</em></p>
<span id='104'>How is't, my lord? how look you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>I have received a hurt: follow me, lady.</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slave</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit CORNWALL, led by REGAN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>Second Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>I'll never care what wickedness I do,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>If this man come to good.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>Third Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>If she live long,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And in the end meet the old course of death,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Women will all turn monsters.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>Second Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Let's follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam</span><br/>
<span id='115'>To lead him where he would: his roguish madness</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Allows itself to any thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>Third Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Go thou: I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs</span><br/>
<span id='118'>To apply to his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt severally</em></p>

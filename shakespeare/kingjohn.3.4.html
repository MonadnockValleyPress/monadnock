<h1>King John</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>The same. King Philip's tent.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING PHILIP, LEWIS, CARDINAL PANDULPH, and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>A whole armado of convicted sail</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Is scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CARDINAL PANDULPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Courage and comfort! all shall yet go well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>What can go well, when we have run so ill?</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Arthur ta'en prisoner? divers dear friends slain?</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And bloody England into England gone,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>O'erbearing interruption, spite of France?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LEWIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>What he hath won, that hath he fortified:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>So hot a speed with such advice disposed,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Doth want example: who hath read or heard</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Of any kindred action like to this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Well could I bear that England had this praise,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>So we could find some pattern of our shame.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CONSTANCE</em></p>
<span id='17'>Look, who comes here! a grave unto a soul;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Holding the eternal spirit against her will,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>In the vile prison of afflicted breath.</span><br/>
<span id='20'>I prithee, lady, go away with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Lo, now! now see the issue of your peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Patience, good lady! comfort, gentle Constance!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>No, I defy all counsel, all redress,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>But that which ends all counsel, true redress,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Death, death; O amiable lovely death!</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Thou odouriferous stench! sound rottenness!</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Thou hate and terror to prosperity,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And I will kiss thy detestable bones</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And ring these fingers with thy household worms</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And be a carrion monster like thyself:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smilest</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>O, come to me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>                  O fair affliction, peace!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Then with a passion would I shake the world;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Which scorns a modern invocation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CARDINAL PANDULPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Thou art not holy to belie me so;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!</span><br/>
<span id='50'>For then, 'tis like I should forget myself:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>O, if I could, what grief should I forget!</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Preach some philosophy to make me mad,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>For being not mad but sensible of grief,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>My reasonable part produces reason</span><br/>
<span id='56'>How I may be deliver'd of these woes,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And teaches me to kill or hang myself:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>If I were mad, I should forget my son,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Or madly think a babe of clouts were he:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>I am not mad; too well, too well I feel</span><br/>
<span id='61'>The different plague of each calamity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note</span><br/>
<span id='63'>In the fair multitude of those her hairs!</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Do glue themselves in sociable grief,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Sticking together in calamity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>To England, if you will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Bind up your hairs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?</span><br/>
<span id='72'>I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud</span><br/>
<span id='73'>'O that these hands could so redeem my son,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>As they have given these hairs their liberty!'</span><br/>
<span id='75'>But now I envy at their liberty,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And will again commit them to their bonds,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Because my poor child is a prisoner.</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And, father cardinal, I have heard you say</span><br/>
<span id='79'>That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>If that be true, I shall see my boy again;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>To him that did but yesterday suspire,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>There was not such a gracious creature born.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And chase the native beauty from his cheek</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And he will look as hollow as a ghost,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And so he'll die; and, rising so again,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>When I shall meet him in the court of heaven</span><br/>
<span id='90'>I shall not know him: therefore never, never</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CARDINAL PANDULPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>You hold too heinous a respect of grief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>He talks to me that never had a son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>You are as fond of grief as of your child.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Grief fills the room up of my absent child,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Remembers me of all his gracious parts,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>I could give better comfort than you do.</span><br/>
<span id='103'>I will not keep this form upon my head,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>When there is such disorder in my wit.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!</span><br/>
<span id='106'>My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!</span><br/>
<span id='107'>My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LEWIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>There's nothing in this world can make me joy:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste</span><br/>
<span id='113'>That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CARDINAL PANDULPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Before the curing of a strong disease,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Even in the instant of repair and health,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>The fit is strongest; evils that take leave,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>On their departure most of all show evil:</span><br/>
<span id='118'>What have you lost by losing of this day?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LEWIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>All days of glory, joy and happiness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CARDINAL PANDULPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>If you had won it, certainly you had.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>She looks upon them with a threatening eye.</span><br/>
<span id='123'>'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost</span><br/>
<span id='124'>In this which he accounts so clearly won:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LEWIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>As heartily as he is glad he hath him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CARDINAL PANDULPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>For even the breath of what I mean to speak</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Out of the path which shall directly lead</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark.</span><br/>
<span id='133'>John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be</span><br/>
<span id='134'>That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>The misplaced John should entertain an hour,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.</span><br/>
<span id='137'>A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>And he that stands upon a slippery place</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:</span><br/>
<span id='141'>That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall;</span><br/>
<span id='142'>So be it, for it cannot be but so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LEWIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CARDINAL PANDULPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>May then make all the claim that Arthur did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>LEWIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>CARDINAL PANDULPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>How green you are and fresh in this old world!</span><br/>
<span id='148'>John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;</span><br/>
<span id='149'>For he that steeps his safety in true blood</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.</span><br/>
<span id='151'>This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>That none so small advantage shall step forth</span><br/>
<span id='154'>To cheque his reign, but they will cherish it;</span><br/>
<span id='155'>No natural exhalation in the sky,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>No common wind, no customed event,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>But they will pluck away his natural cause</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>LEWIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>But hold himself safe in his prisonment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>CARDINAL PANDULPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>If that young Arthur be not gone already,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Of all his people shall revolt from him</span><br/>
<span id='168'>And kiss the lips of unacquainted change</span><br/>
<span id='169'>And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And, O, what better matter breeds for you</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Is now in England, ransacking the church,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Offending charity: if but a dozen French</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Were there in arms, they would be as a call</span><br/>
<span id='177'>To train ten thousand English to their side,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Or as a little snow, tumbled about,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderful</span><br/>
<span id='181'>What may be wrought out of their discontent,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Now that their souls are topful of offence.</span><br/>
<span id='183'>For England go: I will whet on the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>LEWIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>Strong reasons make strong actions: let us go:</span><br/>
<span id='185'>If you say ay, the king will not say no.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Measure for Measure</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene IV</H3>
<h4>A room in Angelo's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions</span><br/>
<span id='3'>show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be</span><br/>
<span id='4'>not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and</span><br/>
<span id='5'>redeliver our authorities there</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>I guess not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his</span><br/>
<span id='8'>entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>they should exhibit their petitions in the street?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of</span><br/>
<span id='11'>complaints, and to deliver us from devices</span><br/>
<span id='12'>hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand</span><br/>
<span id='13'>against us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes</span><br/>
<span id='15'>i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give</span><br/>
<span id='16'>notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet</span><br/>
<span id='17'>him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>I shall, sir. Fare you well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Good night.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit ESCALUS</em></p>
<span id='20'>This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And by an eminent body that enforced</span><br/>
<span id='23'>The law against it! But that her tender shame</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>For my authority bears of a credent bulk,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>That no particular scandal once can touch</span><br/>
<span id='28'>But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>By so receiving a dishonour'd life</span><br/>
<span id='32'>With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!</span><br/>
<span id='33'>A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

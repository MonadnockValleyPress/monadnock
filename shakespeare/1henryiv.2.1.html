<blockquote>
<em>Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Carrier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I'll be</span><br/>
<span id='2'>hanged: Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and</span><br/>
<span id='3'>yet our horse not packed. What, ostler!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Ostler</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>[Within]   Anon, anon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>First Carrier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks</span><br/>
<span id='6'>in the point; poor jade, is wrung in the withers out</span><br/>
<span id='7'>of all cess.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter another Carrier</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Carrier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that</span><br/>
<span id='9'>is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this</span><br/>
<span id='10'>house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Carrier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of oats</span><br/>
<span id='12'>rose; it was the death of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Second Carrier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>I think this be the most villanous house in all</span><br/>
<span id='14'>London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>First Carrier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Like a tench! by the mass, there is ne'er a king</span><br/>
<span id='16'>christen could be better bit than I have been since</span><br/>
<span id='17'>the first cock.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Second Carrier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we</span><br/>
<span id='19'>leak in your chimney; and your chamber-lie breeds</span><br/>
<span id='20'>fleas like a loach.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>First Carrier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>What, ostler! come away and be hanged!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Second Carrier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>First Carrier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite</span><br/>
<span id='25'>starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou</span><br/>
<span id='26'>never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An</span><br/>
<span id='27'>'twere not as good deed as drink, to break the pate</span><br/>
<span id='28'>on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged!</span><br/>
<span id='29'>hast thou no faith in thee?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GADSHILL</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GADSHILL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>First Carrier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>I think it be two o'clock.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GADSHILL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I pray thee lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding</span><br/>
<span id='33'>in the stable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Carrier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Nay, by God, soft; I know a trick worth two of that, i' faith.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GADSHILL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>I pray thee, lend me thine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Second Carrier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth</span><br/>
<span id='37'>he? marry, I'll see thee hanged first.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GADSHILL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Second Carrier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant</span><br/>
<span id='40'>thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the</span><br/>
<span id='41'>gentleman: they will along with company, for they</span><br/>
<span id='42'>have great charge.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt carriers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>GADSHILL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>What, ho! chamberlain!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>[Within]  At hand, quoth pick-purse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GADSHILL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>That's even as fair as&mdash;at hand, quoth the</span><br/>
<span id='46'>chamberlain; for thou variest no more from picking</span><br/>
<span id='47'>of purses than giving direction doth from labouring;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>thou layest the plot how.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Chamberlain</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that</span><br/>
<span id='50'>I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the</span><br/>
<span id='51'>wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with</span><br/>
<span id='52'>him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his</span><br/>
<span id='53'>company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one</span><br/>
<span id='54'>that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>They are up already, and call for eggs and butter;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>they will away presently.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>GADSHILL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'</span><br/>
<span id='58'>clerks, I'll give thee this neck.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the</span><br/>
<span id='60'>hangman; for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas</span><br/>
<span id='61'>as truly as a man of falsehood may.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>GADSHILL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no</span><br/>
<span id='65'>starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou</span><br/>
<span id='66'>dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are</span><br/>
<span id='67'>content to do the profession some grace; that would,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>if matters should be looked into, for their own</span><br/>
<span id='69'>credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no</span><br/>
<span id='70'>foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and</span><br/>
<span id='73'>great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will</span><br/>
<span id='74'>strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than</span><br/>
<span id='75'>drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the</span><br/>
<span id='77'>commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey</span><br/>
<span id='78'>on her, for they ride up and down on her and make</span><br/>
<span id='79'>her their boots.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold</span><br/>
<span id='81'>out water in foul way?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>GADSHILL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>She will, she will; justice hath liquored her. We</span><br/>
<span id='83'>steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt</span><br/>
<span id='84'>of fern-seed, we walk invisible.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to</span><br/>
<span id='86'>the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>GADSHILL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our</span><br/>
<span id='88'>purchase, as I am a true man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>GADSHILL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the</span><br/>
<span id='91'>ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>you muddy knave.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

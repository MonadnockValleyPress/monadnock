<h1>The Merchant of Venice</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Belmont. A room in Portia's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.</span><br/>
<span id='4'>There's something tells me, but it is not love,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I would not lose you; and you know yourself,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Hate counsels not in such a quality.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>But lest you should not understand me well,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>I would detain you here some month or two</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Before you venture for me. I could teach you</span><br/>
<span id='11'>How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>So will I never be: so may you miss me;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>One half of me is yours, the other half yours,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And so all yours. O, these naughty times</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Put bars between the owners and their rights!</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To eke it and to draw it out in length,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>To stay you from election.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Let me choose</span><br/>
<span id='26'>For as I am, I live upon the rack.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess</span><br/>
<span id='28'>What treason there is mingled with your love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>None but that ugly treason of mistrust,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>There may as well be amity and life</span><br/>
<span id='32'>'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Where men enforced do speak anything.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Well then, confess and live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>'Confess' and 'love'</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Had been the very sum of my confession:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>O happy torment, when my torturer</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Doth teach me answers for deliverance!</span><br/>
<span id='41'>But let me to my fortune and the caskets.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>If you do love me, you will find me out.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Let music sound while he doth make his choice;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Fading in music: that the comparison</span><br/>
<span id='48'>May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And watery death-bed for him. He may win;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And what is music then? Then music is</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Even as the flourish when true subjects bow</span><br/>
<span id='52'>To a new-crowned monarch: such it is</span><br/>
<span id='53'>As are those dulcet sounds in break of day</span><br/>
<span id='54'>That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>With no less presence, but with much more love,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Than young Alcides, when he did redeem</span><br/>
<span id='58'>The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy</span><br/>
<span id='59'>To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice</span><br/>
<span id='60'>The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>With bleared visages, come forth to view</span><br/>
<span id='62'>The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay</span><br/>
<span id='64'>I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.</span><br/>
<p><em>Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself</em></p>
<span id='65'>SONG.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Tell me where is fancy bred,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Or in the heart, or in the head?</span><br/>
<span id='68'>How begot, how nourished?</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Reply, reply.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>It is engender'd in the eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>With gazing fed; and fancy dies</span><br/>
<span id='72'>In the cradle where it lies.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Let us all ring fancy's knell</span><br/>
<span id='74'>I'll begin it,&mdash;Ding, dong, bell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Ding, dong, bell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>So may the outward shows be least themselves:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>The world is still deceived with ornament.</span><br/>
<span id='78'>In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Obscures the show of evil? In religion,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>What damned error, but some sober brow</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Will bless it and approve it with a text,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?</span><br/>
<span id='84'>There is no vice so simple but assumes</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false</span><br/>
<span id='87'>As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins</span><br/>
<span id='88'>The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And these assume but valour's excrement</span><br/>
<span id='91'>To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Which therein works a miracle in nature,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Making them lightest that wear most of it:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>So are those crisped snaky golden locks</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Upon supposed fairness, often known</span><br/>
<span id='98'>To be the dowry of a second head,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Thus ornament is but the guiled shore</span><br/>
<span id='101'>To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>The seeming truth which cunning times put on</span><br/>
<span id='104'>To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge</span><br/>
<span id='107'>'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And here choose I; joy be the consequence!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>[Aside]  How all the other passions fleet to air,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.</span><br/>
<span id='116'>I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>For fear I surfeit.</span><br/>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>What find I here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Opening the leaden casket</em></p>
<span id='119'>Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs</span><br/>
<span id='125'>The painter plays the spider and hath woven</span><br/>
<span id='126'>A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='128'>How could he see to do them? having made one,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Methinks it should have power to steal both his</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far</span><br/>
<span id='131'>The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow</span><br/>
<span id='132'>In underprizing it, so far this shadow</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>The continent and summary of my fortune.</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='135'>You that choose not by the view,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Chance as fair and choose as true!</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Since this fortune falls to you,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Be content and seek no new,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>If you be well pleased with this</span><br/>
<span id='140'>And hold your fortune for your bliss,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Turn you where your lady is</span><br/>
<span id='142'>And claim her with a loving kiss.</span><br/><br/>
<span id='143'>A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;</span><br/>
<span id='144'>I come by note, to give and to receive.</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Like one of two contending in a prize,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Hearing applause and universal shout,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;</span><br/>
<span id='150'>So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;</span><br/>
<span id='151'>As doubtful whether what I see be true,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.</span><br/>

<span id='153'>You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Such as I am: though for myself alone</span><br/>
<span id='155'>I would not be ambitious in my wish,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>To wish myself much better; yet, for you</span><br/>
<span id='157'>I would be trebled twenty times myself;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>That only to stand high in your account,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Exceed account; but the full sum of me</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Happy in this, she is not yet so old</span><br/>
<span id='165'>But she may learn; happier than this,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>She is not bred so dull but she can learn;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Commits itself to yours to be directed,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>As from her lord, her governor, her king.</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Myself and what is mine to you and yours</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Is now converted: but now I was the lord</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>This house, these servants and this same myself</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Which when you part from, lose, or give away,</span><br/>

<span id='181'>And there is such confusion in my powers,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>As after some oration fairly spoke</span><br/>
<span id='183'>By a beloved prince, there doth appear</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Among the buzzing pleased multitude;</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Where every something, being blent together,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:</span><br/>

<span id='257'>O sweet Portia,</span><br/>
<span id='258'>Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words</span><br/>
<span id='259'>That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,</span><br/>
<span id='260'>When I did first impart my love to you,</span><br/>
<span id='261'>I freely told you, all the wealth I had</span><br/>
<span id='262'>Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;</span><br/>
<span id='263'>And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,</span><br/>
<span id='264'>Rating myself at nothing, you shall see</span><br/>
<span id='265'>How much I was a braggart. When I told you</span><br/>
<span id='266'>My state was nothing, I should then have told you</span><br/>
<span id='267'>That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,</span><br/>
<span id='268'>I have engaged myself to a dear friend,</span><br/>
<span id='269'>Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,</span><br/>
<span id='270'>To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;</span><br/>
<span id='271'>The paper as the body of my friend,</span><br/>
<span id='272'>And every word in it a gaping wound,</span><br/>
<span id='273'>Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?</span><br/>
<span id='274'>Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?</span><br/>
<span id='275'>From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,</span><br/>
<span id='276'>From Lisbon, Barbary and India?</span><br/>

<span id='280'>Besides, it should appear, that if he had</span><br/>
<span id='281'>The present money to discharge the Jew,</span><br/>
<span id='282'>He would not take it. Never did I know</span><br/>
<span id='283'>A creature, that did bear the shape of man,</span><br/>
<span id='284'>So keen and greedy to confound a man:</span><br/>
<span id='285'>He plies the duke at morning and at night,</span><br/>
<span id='286'>And doth impeach the freedom of the state,</span><br/>
<span id='287'>If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,</span><br/>
<span id='288'>The duke himself, and the magnificoes</span><br/>
<span id='289'>Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;</span><br/>

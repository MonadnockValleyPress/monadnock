<h1>Two Gentlemen of Verona</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene VII</h3>
<h4>Verona. Julia's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter JULIA and LUCETTA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And even in kind love I do conjure thee,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Who art the table wherein all my thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Are visibly character'd and engraved,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>To lesson me and tell me some good mean</span><br/>
<span id='6'>How, with my honour, I may undertake</span><br/>
<span id='7'>A journey to my loving Proteus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LUCETTA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Alas, the way is wearisome and long!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And when the flight is made to one so dear,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LUCETTA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Better forbear till Proteus make return.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Pity the dearth that I have pined in,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>By longing for that food so long a time.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow</span><br/>
<span id='20'>As seek to quench the fire of love with words.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LUCETTA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>But qualify the fire's extreme rage,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The current that with gentle murmur glides,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>But when his fair course is not hindered,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge</span><br/>
<span id='30'>He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And so by many winding nooks he strays</span><br/>
<span id='32'>With willing sport to the wild ocean.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Then let me go and hinder not my course</span><br/>
<span id='34'>I'll be as patient as a gentle stream</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And make a pastime of each weary step,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Till the last step have brought me to my love;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil</span><br/>
<span id='38'>A blessed soul doth in Elysium.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LUCETTA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>But in what habit will you go along?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Not like a woman; for I would prevent</span><br/>
<span id='41'>The loose encounters of lascivious men:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds</span><br/>
<span id='43'>As may beseem some well-reputed page.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LUCETTA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings</span><br/>
<span id='46'>With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>To be fantastic may become a youth</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Of greater time than I shall show to be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LUCETTA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>What compass will you wear your farthingale?'</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LUCETTA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Out, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LUCETTA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have</span><br/>
<span id='58'>What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me</span><br/>
<span id='60'>For undertaking so unstaid a journey?</span><br/>
<span id='61'>I fear me, it will make me scandalized.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LUCETTA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>If you think so, then stay at home and go not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Nay, that I will not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LUCETTA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Then never dream on infamy, but go.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>If Proteus like your journey when you come,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>No matter who's displeased when you are gone:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And instances of infinite of love</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LUCETTA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>All these are servants to deceitful men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Base men, that use them to so base effect!</span><br/>
<span id='74'>But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth</span><br/>
<span id='75'>His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LUCETTA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong</span><br/>
<span id='81'>To bear a hard opinion of his truth:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Only deserve my love by loving him;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And presently go with me to my chamber,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To take a note of what I stand in need of,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>To furnish me upon my longing journey.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>My goods, my lands, my reputation;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Come, answer not, but to it presently!</span><br/>
<span id='90'>I am impatient of my tarriance.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

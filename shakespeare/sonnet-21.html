<h3>XXI</h3>
<p>
So is it not with me as with that Muse,<br/>
Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,<br/>
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use<br/>
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,<br/>
Making a couplement of proud compare'<br/>
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,<br/>
With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,<br/>
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.<br/>
O! let me, true in love, but truly write,<br/>
And then believe me, my love is as fair<br/>
As any mother's child, though not so bright<br/>
As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them say more that like of hearsay well;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not praise that purpose not to sell.<br/>

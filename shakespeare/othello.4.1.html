<h1>Othello</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Cyprus. Before the castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter OTHELLO and IAGO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Will you think so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>                  Think so, Iago!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>What,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To kiss in private?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>An unauthorized kiss.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Or to be naked with her friend in bed</span><br/>
<span id='7'>An hour or more, not meaning any harm?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!</span><br/>
<span id='9'>It is hypocrisy against the devil:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>But if I give my wife a handkerchief,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>What then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>She may, I think, bestow't on any man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>She is protectress of her honour too:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>May she give that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Her honour is an essence that's not seen;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>They have it very oft that have it not:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>But, for the handkerchief,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>As doth the raven o'er the infected house,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Boding to all&mdash;he had my handkerchief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Ay, what of that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>                  That's not so good now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>What,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Or heard him say,&mdash;as knaves be such abroad,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Who having, by their own importunate suit,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose</span><br/>
<span id='34'>But they must blab&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Hath he said any thing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>No more than he'll unswear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>What hath he said?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>'Faith, that he did&mdash;I know not what he did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>What? what?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Lie&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>    With her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>With her, on her; what you will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when</span><br/>
<span id='45'>they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>&mdash;Handkerchief&mdash;confessions&mdash;handkerchief!&mdash;To</span><br/>
<span id='47'>confess, and be hanged for his labour;&mdash;first, to be</span><br/>
<span id='48'>hanged, and then to confess.&mdash;I tremble at it.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing</span><br/>
<span id='50'>passion without some instruction. It is not words</span><br/>
<span id='51'>that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>&mdash;Is't possible?&mdash;Confess&mdash;handkerchief!&mdash;O devil!&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>Falls in a trance</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Work on,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!</span><br/>
<span id='57'>My lord, I say! Othello!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CASSIO</em></p>
<span id='58'>How now, Cassio!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>What's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Rub him about the temples.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>No, forbear;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>The lethargy must have his quiet course:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>If not, he foams at mouth and by and by</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Do you withdraw yourself a little while,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>He will recover straight: when he is gone,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>I would on great occasion speak with you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit CASSIO</em></p>
<span id='70'>How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Dost thou mock me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>                  I mock you! no, by heaven.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Would you would bear your fortune like a man!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>A horned man's a monster and a beast.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>There's many a beast then in a populous city,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And many a civil monster.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Did he confess it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>                  Good sir, be a man;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked</span><br/>
<span id='80'>May draw with you: there's millions now alive</span><br/>
<span id='81'>That nightly lie in those unproper beds</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To lip a wanton in a secure couch,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Stand you awhile apart;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Confine yourself but in a patient list.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>A passion most unsuiting such a man&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Bade him anon return and here speak with me;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>That dwell in every region of his face;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>For I will make him tell the tale anew,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when</span><br/>
<span id='100'>He hath, and is again to cope your wife:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And nothing of a man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Dost thou hear, Iago?</span><br/>
<span id='105'>I will be found most cunning in my patience;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>But&mdash;dost thou hear?&mdash;most bloody.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>That's not amiss;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?</span><br/>
<p><em>OTHELLO retires</em></p>
<span id='109'>Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>A housewife that by selling her desires</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature</span><br/>
<span id='112'>That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague</span><br/>
<span id='113'>To beguile many and be beguiled by one:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain</span><br/>
<span id='115'>From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter CASSIO</em></p>
<span id='116'>As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And his unbookish jealousy must construe</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>The worser that you give me the addition</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Whose want even kills me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.</span><br/>
<p><em>Speaking lower</em></p>
<span id='123'>Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>How quickly should you speed!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Alas, poor caitiff!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Look, how he laughs already!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>I never knew woman love man so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Do you hear, Cassio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Now he importunes him</span><br/>
<span id='132'>To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>She gives it out that you shall marry hey:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Do you intend it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Ha, ha, ha!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some</span><br/>
<span id='138'>charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Ha, ha, ha!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Prithee, say true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>I am a very villain else.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Have you scored me? Well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>This is the monkey's own giving out: she is</span><br/>
<span id='146'>persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and</span><br/>
<span id='147'>flattery, not out of my promise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.</span><br/>
<span id='150'>I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with</span><br/>
<span id='151'>certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture</span><br/>
<span id='154'>imports it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall</span><br/>
<span id='159'>throw it to.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Well, I must leave her company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>Before me! look, where she comes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BIANCA</em></p>
<span id='163'>What do you mean by this haunting of me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you</span><br/>
<span id='165'>mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?</span><br/>
<span id='166'>I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the</span><br/>
<span id='167'>work?&mdash;A likely piece of work, that you should find</span><br/>
<span id='168'>it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!</span><br/>
<span id='169'>This is some minx's token, and I must take out the</span><br/>
<span id='170'>work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever</span><br/>
<span id='171'>you had it, I'll take out no work on't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you</span><br/>
<span id='175'>will not, come when you are next prepared for.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>After her, after her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>Will you sup there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>'Faith, I intend so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain</span><br/>
<span id='181'>speak with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>Prithee, come; will you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>Go to; say no more.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit CASSIO</em></p>

<span id='speech78'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>[Advancing]  How shall I murder him, Iago?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>O Iago!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>And did you see the handkerchief?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Was that mine?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the</span><br/>
<span id='190'>foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he</span><br/>
<span id='191'>hath given it his whore.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>I would have him nine years a-killing.</span><br/>
<span id='193'>A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!</span><br/>

<span id='194'>Nay, you must forget that.</span><br/>

<span id='speech86'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;</span><br/>
<span id='196'>for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to</span><br/>
<span id='197'>stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the</span><br/>
<span id='198'>world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by</span><br/>
<span id='199'>an emperor's side and command him tasks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>Nay, that's not your way.</span><br/>

<span id='speech88'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate</span><br/>
<span id='202'>with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she</span><br/>
<span id='203'>will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high</span><br/>
<span id='204'>and plenteous wit and invention:&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech89'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>She's the worse for all this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech90'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so</span><br/>
<span id='207'>gentle a condition!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech91'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>Ay, too gentle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech92'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='209'>Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!</span><br/>
<span id='210'>O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech93'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='211'>If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her</span><br/>
<span id='212'>patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes</span><br/>
<span id='213'>near nobody.</span><br/>

<span id='speech94'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!</span><br/>

<span id='speech96'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>With mine officer!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech97'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>That's fouler.</span><br/>

<span id='speech98'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>

<span id='218'>Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not</span><br/>
<span id='219'>expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty</span><br/>
<span id='220'>unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.</span><br/>

<span id='speech99'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even</span><br/>
<span id='222'>the bed she hath contaminated.</span><br/>

<span id='speech100'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='223'>Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech101'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>

<span id='224'>And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you</span><br/>

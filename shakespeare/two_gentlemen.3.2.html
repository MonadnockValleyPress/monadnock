<h1>Two Gentlemen of Verona</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</H3>
<h4>The same. The Duke's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DUKE and THURIO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>THURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Since his exile she hath despised me most,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>That I am desperate of obtaining her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>This weak impress of love is as a figure</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>A little time will melt her frozen thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PROTEUS</em></p>
<span id='11'>How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman</span><br/>
<span id='12'>According to our proclamation gone?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Gone, my good lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>My daughter takes his going grievously.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>For thou hast shown some sign of good desert&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Makes me the better to confer with thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Longer than I prove loyal to your grace</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Let me not live to look upon your grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Thou know'st how willingly I would effect</span><br/>
<span id='23'>The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>I do, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>And also, I think, thou art not ignorant</span><br/>
<span id='26'>How she opposes her against my will</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Ay, and perversely she persevers so.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>What might we do to make the girl forget</span><br/>
<span id='30'>The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>The best way is to slander Valentine</span><br/>
<span id='32'>With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Three things that women highly hold in hate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Ay, if his enemy deliver it:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken</span><br/>
<span id='37'>By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Then you must undertake to slander him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Especially against his very friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Where your good word cannot advantage him,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Your slander never can endamage him;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Therefore the office is indifferent,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Being entreated to it by your friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>You have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do it</span><br/>
<span id='47'>By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>She shall not long continue love to him.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>But say this weed her love from Valentine,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>THURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Lest it should ravel and be good to none,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>You must provide to bottom it on me;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Which must be done by praising me as much</span><br/>
<span id='55'>As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Because we know, on Valentine's report,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>You are already Love's firm votary</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Upon this warrant shall you have access</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Where you with Silvia may confer at large;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Where you may temper her by your persuasion</span><br/>
<span id='65'>To hate young Valentine and love my friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>As much as I can do, I will effect:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>You must lay lime to tangle her desires</span><br/>
<span id='69'>By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Ay,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Say that upon the altar of her beauty</span><br/>
<span id='74'>You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Moist it again, and frame some feeling line</span><br/>
<span id='77'>That may discover such integrity:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Make tigers tame and huge leviathans</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>After your dire-lamenting elegies,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Visit by night your lady's chamber-window</span><br/>
<span id='84'>With some sweet concert; to their instruments</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.</span><br/>
<span id='87'>This, or else nothing, will inherit her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>This discipline shows thou hast been in love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>THURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Let us into the city presently</span><br/>
<span id='92'>To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>I have a sonnet that will serve the turn</span><br/>
<span id='94'>To give the onset to thy good advice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>About it, gentlemen!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And afterward determine our proceedings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Even now about it! I will pardon you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

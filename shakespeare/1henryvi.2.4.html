<h1>Henry VI, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>London. The Temple-garden.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the Earls of SOMERSET, SUFFOLK, and WARWICK; RICHARD PLANTAGENET, VERNON, and another Lawyer</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Dare no man answer in a case of truth?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Within the Temple-hall we were too loud;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>The garden here is more convenient.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Faith, I have been a truant in the law,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And never yet could frame my will to it;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And therefore frame the law unto my will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Between two blades, which bears the better temper:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Between two horses, which doth bear him best;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>The truth appears so naked on my side</span><br/>
<span id='21'>That any purblind eye may find it out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>And on my side it is so well apparell'd,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>So clear, so shining and so evident</span><br/>
<span id='24'>That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Let him that is a true-born gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And stands upon the honour of his birth,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>But dare maintain the party of the truth,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>I love no colours, and without all colour</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Of base insinuating flattery</span><br/>
<span id='36'>I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>I pluck this red rose with young Somerset</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And say withal I think he held the right.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>VERNON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Till you conclude that he upon whose side</span><br/>
<span id='41'>The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Shall yield the other in the right opinion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>And I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>VERNON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Then for the truth and plainness of the case.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Giving my verdict on the white rose side.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And fall on my side so, against your will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>VERNON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>If I my lord, for my opinion bleed,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And keep me on the side where still I am.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Well, well, come on: who else?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Lawyer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Unless my study and my books be false,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>The argument you held was wrong in you:</span><br/>
<p><em>To SOMERSET</em></p>
<span id='58'>In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Now, Somerset, where is your argument?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Here in my scabbard, meditating that</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>For pale they look with fear, as witnessing</span><br/>
<span id='64'>The truth on our side.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>No, Plantagenet,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>That shall maintain what I have said is true,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Away, away, good William de la Pole!</span><br/>
<span id='82'>We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Now, by God's will, thou wrong'st him, Somerset;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Third son to the third Edward King of England:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>He bears him on the place's privilege,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>By him that made me, I'll maintain my words</span><br/>
<span id='90'>On any plot of ground in Christendom.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>For treason executed in our late king's days?</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And, by his treason, stand'st not thou attainted,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?</span><br/>
<span id='95'>His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>My father was attached, not attainted,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Were growing time once ripen'd to my will.</span><br/>
<span id='101'>For your partaker Pole and you yourself,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>I'll note you in my book of memory,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>To scourge you for this apprehension:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Look to it well and say you are well warn'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And know us by these colours for thy foes,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Will I for ever and my faction wear,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Until it wither with me to my grave</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Or flourish to the height of my degree.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Go forward and be choked with thy ambition!</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And so farewell until I meet thee next.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Have with thee, Pole. Farewell, ambitious Richard.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>How I am braved and must perforce endure it!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>This blot that they object against your house</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Shall be wiped out in the next parliament</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;</span><br/>
<span id='120'>And if thou be not then created York,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>I will not live to be accounted Warwick.</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Against proud Somerset and William Pole,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Will I upon thy party wear this rose:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Grown to this faction in the Temple-garden,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Shall send between the red rose and the white</span><br/>
<span id='128'>A thousand souls to death and deadly night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>VERNON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>In your behalf still will I wear the same.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Lawyer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>And so will I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Thanks, gentle sir.</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Come, let us four to dinner: I dare say</span><br/>
<span id='135'>This quarrel will drink blood another day.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

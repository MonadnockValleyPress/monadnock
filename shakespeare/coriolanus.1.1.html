<h1>Coriolanus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Rome. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Speak, speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Resolved, resolved.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>We know't, we know't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Is't a verdict?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>One word, good citizens.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they</span><br/>
<span id='13'>would yield us but the superfluity, while it were</span><br/>
<span id='14'>wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>but they think we are too dear: the leanness that</span><br/>
<span id='16'>afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an</span><br/>
<span id='17'>inventory to particularise their abundance; our</span><br/>
<span id='18'>sufferance is a gain to them. Let us revenge this with</span><br/>
<span id='19'>our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I</span><br/>
<span id='20'>speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Consider you what services he has done for his country?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Very well; and could be content to give him good</span><br/>
<span id='25'>report for't, but that he pays himself with being proud.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Nay, but speak not maliciously.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did</span><br/>
<span id='28'>it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be</span><br/>
<span id='29'>content to say it was for his country, he did it to</span><br/>
<span id='30'>please his mother and to be partly proud; which he</span><br/>
<span id='31'>is, even till the altitude of his virtue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>What he cannot help in his nature, you account a</span><br/>
<span id='33'>vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.</span><br/>
<p><em>Shouts within</em></p>
<span id='36'>What shouts are these? The other side o' the city</span><br/>
<span id='37'>is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Come, come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Soft! who comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved</span><br/>
<span id='41'>the people.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you</span><br/>
<span id='44'>With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have</span><br/>
<span id='46'>had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor</span><br/>
<span id='48'>suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we</span><br/>
<span id='49'>have strong arms too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Will you undo yourselves?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>We cannot, sir, we are undone already.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>I tell you, friends, most charitable care</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Have the patricians of you. For your wants,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Against the Roman state, whose course will on</span><br/>
<span id='58'>The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Of more strong link asunder than can ever</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>The gods, not the patricians, make it, and</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>You are transported by calamity</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Thither where more attends you, and you slander</span><br/>
<span id='65'>The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>When you curse them as enemies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us</span><br/>
<span id='68'>yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses</span><br/>
<span id='69'>crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to</span><br/>
<span id='70'>support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act</span><br/>
<span id='71'>established against the rich, and provide more</span><br/>
<span id='72'>piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain</span><br/>
<span id='73'>the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and</span><br/>
<span id='74'>there's all the love they bear us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Either you must</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you</span><br/>
<span id='78'>A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture</span><br/>
<span id='80'>To stale 't a little more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to</span><br/>
<span id='82'>fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please</span><br/>
<span id='83'>you, deliver.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>There was a time when all the body's members</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>That only like a gulf it did remain</span><br/>
<span id='87'>I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And, mutually participate, did minister</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Unto the appetite and affection common</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Of the whole body. The belly answer'd&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Well, sir, what answer made the belly?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>For, look you, I may make the belly smile</span><br/>
<span id='98'>As well as speak&mdash;it tauntingly replied</span><br/>
<span id='99'>To the discontented members, the mutinous parts</span><br/>
<span id='100'>That envied his receipt; even so most fitly</span><br/>
<span id='101'>As you malign our senators for that</span><br/>
<span id='102'>They are not such as you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Your belly's answer? What!</span><br/>
<span id='104'>The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.</span><br/>
<span id='107'>With other muniments and petty helps</span><br/>
<span id='108'>In this our fabric, if that they&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>What then?</span><br/>
<span id='110'>'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Who is the sink o' the body,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Well, what then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>The former agents, if they did complain,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>What could the belly answer?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I will tell you</span><br/>
<span id='117'>If you'll bestow a small&mdash;of what you have little&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Ye're long about it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Note me this, good friend;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Your most grave belly was deliberate,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>'That I receive the general food at first,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Which you do live upon; and fit it is,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Because I am the store-house and the shop</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>I send it through the rivers of your blood,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And, through the cranks and offices of man,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>The strongest nerves and small inferior veins</span><br/>
<span id='132'>From me receive that natural competency</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Whereby they live: and though that all at once,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>You, my good friends,'&mdash;this says the belly, mark me,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Ay, sir; well, well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>'Though all at once cannot</span><br/>
<span id='137'>See what I do deliver out to each,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Yet I can make my audit up, that all</span><br/>
<span id='139'>From me do back receive the flour of all,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>It was an answer: how apply you this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>The senators of Rome are this good belly,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>And you the mutinous members; for examine</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find</span><br/>
<span id='146'>No public benefit which you receive</span><br/>
<span id='147'>But it proceeds or comes from them to you</span><br/>
<span id='148'>And no way from yourselves. What do you think,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>You, the great toe of this assembly?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>I the great toe! why the great toe?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Lead'st first to win some vantage.</span><br/>
<span id='155'>But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>The one side must have bale.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CAIUS MARCIUS</em></p>
<span id='158'>Hail, noble Marcius!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Make yourselves scabs?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>We have ever your good word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>He that will give good words to thee will flatter</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is</span><br/>
<span id='171'>To make him worthy whose offence subdues him</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And curse that justice did it.</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Who deserves greatness</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Deserves your hate; and your affections are</span><br/>
<span id='175'>A sick man's appetite, who desires most that</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Which would increase his evil. He that depends</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Upon your favours swims with fins of lead</span><br/>
<span id='178'>And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?</span><br/>
<span id='179'>With every minute you do change a mind,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>And call him noble that was now your hate,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>That in these several places of the city</span><br/>
<span id='183'>You cry against the noble senate, who,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>The city is well stored.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Hang 'em! They say!</span><br/>
<span id='189'>They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know</span><br/>
<span id='190'>What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Who thrives and who declines; side factions</span><br/>
<span id='192'>and give out</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Conjectural marriages; making parties strong</span><br/>
<span id='194'>And feebling such as stand not in their liking</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's</span><br/>
<span id='196'>grain enough!</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry</span><br/>
<span id='199'>With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high</span><br/>
<span id='200'>As I could pick my lance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;</span><br/>
<span id='202'>For though abundantly they lack discretion,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>What says the other troop?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>They are dissolved: hang 'em!</span><br/>
<span id='206'>They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds</span><br/>
<span id='210'>They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>And a petition granted them, a strange one&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='212'>To break the heart of generosity,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>And make bold power look pale&mdash;they threw their caps</span><br/>
<span id='214'>As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Shouting their emulation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>What is granted them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,</span><br/>
<span id='218'>Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Sicinius Velutus, and I know not&mdash;'Sdeath!</span><br/>
<span id='220'>The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,</span><br/>
<span id='221'>Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time</span><br/>
<span id='222'>Win upon power and throw forth greater themes</span><br/>
<span id='223'>For insurrection's arguing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='224'>This is strange.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='225'>Go, get you home, you fragments!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger, hastily</em></p>

<span id='speech59'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>

<span id='226'>Where's Caius Marcius?</span><br/>

<span id='227'>Here: what's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>

<span id='228'>The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.</span><br/>

<span id='speech62'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>

<span id='229'>I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent</span><br/>
<span id='230'>Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators; JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='231'>Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;</span><br/>
<span id='232'>The Volsces are in arms.</span><br/>

<span id='speech64'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='233'>They have a leader,</span><br/>
<span id='234'>Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.</span><br/>
<span id='235'>I sin in envying his nobility,</span><br/>
<span id='236'>And were I any thing but what I am,</span><br/>
<span id='237'>I would wish me only he.</span><br/>

<span id='speech65'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='238'>You have fought together.</span><br/>

<span id='speech66'><strong>MARCIUS</strong></span>

<span id='240'>Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make</span><br/>

<span id='242'>That I am proud to hunt.</span><br/>

<span id='speech67'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>

<span id='243'>Then, worthy Marcius,</span><br/>
<span id='244'>Attend upon Cominius to these wars.</span><br/>

<span id='246'>Sir, it is;</span><br/>
<span id='247'>And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou</span><br/>

<span id='249'>What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>TITUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='250'>No, Caius Marcius;</span><br/>
<span id='251'>I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,</span><br/>

<span id='260'>Nay, let them follow:</span><br/>
<span id='261'>The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither</span><br/>
<span id='262'>To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutineers,</span><br/>
<span id='263'>Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.</span><br/>

<span id='264'>Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?</span><br/>

<span id='265'>He has no equal.</span><br/>

<span id='268'>Nay, but his taunts.</span><br/>

<span id='speech84'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='271'>The present wars devour him: he is grown</span><br/>
<span id='272'>Too proud to be so valiant.</span><br/>

<span id='speech85'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='273'>Such a nature,</span><br/>
<span id='274'>Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow</span><br/>
<span id='275'>Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder</span><br/>
<span id='276'>His insolence can brook to be commanded</span><br/>
<span id='277'>Under Cominius.</span><br/>

<span id='speech86'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>

<span id='278'>Fame, at the which he aims,</span><br/>
<span id='279'>In whom already he's well graced, can not</span><br/>
<span id='280'>Better be held nor more attain'd than by</span><br/>
<span id='281'>A place below the first: for what miscarries</span><br/>
<span id='282'>Shall be the general's fault, though he perform</span><br/>
<span id='283'>To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure</span><br/>
<span id='284'>Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he</span><br/>
<span id='285'>Had borne the business!'</span><br/>

<span id='286'>Besides, if things go well,</span><br/>

<span id='289'>Come:</span><br/>
<span id='290'>Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.</span><br/>
<span id='291'>Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults</span><br/>
<span id='292'>To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed</span><br/>
<span id='293'>In aught he merit not.</span><br/>

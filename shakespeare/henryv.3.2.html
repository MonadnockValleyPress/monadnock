<h1>Henry V</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The same.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter NYM, BARDOLPH, PISTOL, and Boy</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>NYM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Pray thee, corporal, stay: the knocks are too hot;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>and, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>the humour of it is too hot, that is the very</span><br/>
<span id='5'>plain-song of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>PISTOL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>The plain-song is most just: for humours do abound:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And sword and shield,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>In bloody field,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Doth win immortal fame.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Boy</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Would I were in an alehouse in London! I would give</span><br/>
<span id='12'>all my fame for a pot of ale and safety.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PISTOL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>And I:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>If wishes would prevail with me,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>My purpose should not fail with me,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>But thither would I hie.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Boy</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>          As duly, but not as truly,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>As bird doth sing on bough.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter FLUELLEN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Up to the breach, you dogs! avaunt, you cullions!</span><br/>
<p><em>Driving them forward</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PISTOL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Be merciful, great duke, to men of mould.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Abate thy rage, abate thy manly rage,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Abate thy rage, great duke!</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Good bawcock, bate thy rage; use lenity, sweet chuck!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>NYM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>These be good humours! your honour wins bad humours.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but Boy</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Boy</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>As young as I am, I have observed these three</span><br/>
<span id='26'>swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they</span><br/>
<span id='27'>three, though they would serve me, could not be man</span><br/>
<span id='28'>to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to</span><br/>
<span id='29'>a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and</span><br/>
<span id='30'>red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but</span><br/>
<span id='31'>fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue</span><br/>
<span id='32'>and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks</span><br/>
<span id='33'>words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath</span><br/>
<span id='34'>heard that men of few words are the best men; and</span><br/>
<span id='35'>therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'</span><br/>
<span id='36'>should be thought a coward: but his few bad words</span><br/>
<span id='37'>are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never</span><br/>
<span id='38'>broke any man's head but his own, and that was</span><br/>
<span id='39'>against a post when he was drunk. They will steal</span><br/>
<span id='40'>any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a</span><br/>
<span id='41'>lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for</span><br/>
<span id='42'>three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn</span><br/>
<span id='43'>brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a</span><br/>
<span id='44'>fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the</span><br/>
<span id='45'>men would carry coals. They would have me as</span><br/>
<span id='46'>familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their</span><br/>
<span id='47'>handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>if I should take from another's pocket to put into</span><br/>
<span id='49'>mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I</span><br/>
<span id='50'>must leave them, and seek some better service:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>their villany goes against my weak stomach, and</span><br/>
<span id='52'>therefore I must cast it up.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter FLUELLEN, GOWER following</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the</span><br/>
<span id='54'>mines; the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>To the mines! tell you the duke, it is not so good</span><br/>
<span id='56'>to come to the mines; for, look you, the mines is</span><br/>
<span id='57'>not according to the disciplines of the war: the</span><br/>
<span id='58'>concavities of it is not sufficient; for, look you,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>the athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look</span><br/>
<span id='60'>you, is digt himself four yard under the</span><br/>
<span id='61'>countermines: by Cheshu, I think a' will plough up</span><br/>
<span id='62'>all, if there is not better directions.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the</span><br/>
<span id='64'>siege is given, is altogether directed by an</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i' faith.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>I think it be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world: I will</span><br/>
<span id='69'>verify as much in his beard: be has no more</span><br/>
<span id='70'>directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look</span><br/>
<span id='71'>you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy-dog.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MACMORRIS and Captain JAMY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Here a' comes; and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Captain Jamy is a marvellous falourous gentleman,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>that is certain; and of great expedition and</span><br/>
<span id='75'>knowledge in th' aunchient wars, upon my particular</span><br/>
<span id='76'>knowledge of his directions: by Cheshu, he will</span><br/>
<span id='77'>maintain his argument as well as any military man in</span><br/>
<span id='78'>the world, in the disciplines of the pristine wars</span><br/>
<span id='79'>of the Romans.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>JAMY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>I say gud-day, Captain Fluellen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>God-den to your worship, good Captain James.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>How now, Captain Macmorris! have you quit the</span><br/>
<span id='83'>mines? have the pioneers given o'er?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>MACMORRIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>By Chrish, la! tish ill done: the work ish give</span><br/>
<span id='85'>over, the trompet sound the retreat. By my hand, I</span><br/>
<span id='86'>swear, and my father's soul, the work ish ill done;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>it ish give over: I would have blowed up the town, so</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Chrish save me, la! in an hour: O, tish ill done,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>tish ill done; by my hand, tish ill done!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will you</span><br/>
<span id='91'>voutsafe me, look you, a few disputations with you,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of</span><br/>
<span id='93'>the war, the Roman wars, in the way of argument,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>look you, and friendly communication; partly to</span><br/>
<span id='95'>satisfy my opinion, and partly for the satisfaction,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>look you, of my mind, as touching the direction of</span><br/>
<span id='97'>the military discipline; that is the point.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>JAMY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud captains bath:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>and I sall quit you with gud leve, as I may pick</span><br/>
<span id='100'>occasion; that sall I, marry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MACMORRIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me: the</span><br/>
<span id='102'>day is hot, and the weather, and the wars, and the</span><br/>
<span id='103'>king, and the dukes: it is no time to discourse. The</span><br/>
<span id='104'>town is beseeched, and the trumpet call us to the</span><br/>
<span id='105'>breach; and we talk, and, be Chrish, do nothing:</span><br/>
<span id='106'>'tis shame for us all: so God sa' me, 'tis shame to</span><br/>
<span id='107'>stand still; it is shame, by my hand: and there is</span><br/>
<span id='108'>throats to be cut, and works to be done; and there</span><br/>
<span id='109'>ish nothing done, so Chrish sa' me, la!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>JAMY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>By the mess, ere theise eyes of mine take themselves</span><br/>
<span id='111'>to slomber, ay'll de gud service, or ay'll lig i'</span><br/>
<span id='112'>the grund for it; ay, or go to death; and ay'll pay</span><br/>
<span id='113'>'t as valourously as I may, that sall I suerly do,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>that is the breff and the long. Marry, I wad full</span><br/>
<span id='115'>fain hear some question 'tween you tway.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your</span><br/>
<span id='117'>correction, there is not many of your nation&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>MACMORRIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Of my nation! What ish my nation? Ish a villain,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>and a bastard, and a knave, and a rascal. What ish</span><br/>
<span id='120'>my nation? Who talks of my nation?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is</span><br/>
<span id='122'>meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think</span><br/>
<span id='123'>you do not use me with that affability as in</span><br/>
<span id='124'>discretion you ought to use me, look you: being as</span><br/>
<span id='125'>good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of</span><br/>
<span id='126'>war, and in the derivation of my birth, and in</span><br/>
<span id='127'>other particularities.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>MACMORRIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>I do not know you so good a man as myself: so</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>JAMY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>A! that's a foul fault.</span><br/>
<p><em>A parley sounded</em></p>

<span id='133'>Captain Macmorris, when there is more better</span><br/>
<span id='134'>opportunity to be required, look you, I will be so</span><br/>
<span id='135'>bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war;</span><br/>
<span id='136'>and there is an end.</span><br/>

<h1>Henry VI, Part 3</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene VI</h3>
<h4>London. The Tower.</h4>

<p><em>Enter KING HENRY VI and GLOUCESTER, with the Lieutenant, on the walls</em></p>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Ay, my good lord:&mdash;my lord, I should say rather;<br/>
<span id='3'>'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better:<br/>
<span id='4'>'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,<br/>
<span id='5'>And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.<br/>
<p><em>Exit Lieutenant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;<br/>
<span id='8'>So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece<br/>
<span id='9'>And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.<br/>
<span id='10'>What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;<br/>
<span id='12'>The thief doth fear each bush an officer.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>The bird that hath been limed in a bush,<br/>
<span id='14'>With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;<br/>
<span id='15'>And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,<br/>
<span id='16'>Have now the fatal object in my eye<br/>
<span id='17'>Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,<br/>
<span id='19'>That taught his son the office of a fowl!<br/>
<span id='20'>An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;<br/>
<span id='22'>Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;<br/>
<span id='23'>The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy<br/>
<span id='24'>Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea<br/>
<span id='25'>Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.<br/>
<span id='26'>Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!<br/>
<span id='27'>My breast can better brook thy dagger's point<br/>
<span id='28'>Than can my ears that tragic history.<br/>
<span id='29'>But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Think'st thou I am an executioner?<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:<br/>
<span id='32'>If murdering innocents be executing,<br/>
<span id='33'>Why, then thou art an executioner.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,<br/>
<span id='36'>Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.<br/>
<span id='37'>And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,<br/>
<span id='38'>Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,<br/>
<span id='39'>And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,<br/>
<span id='40'>And many an orphan's water-standing eye&mdash;<br/>
<span id='41'>Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,<br/>
<span id='42'>And orphans for their parents' timeless death&mdash;<br/>
<span id='43'>Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.<br/>
<span id='44'>The owl shriek'd at thy birth,&mdash;an evil sign;<br/>
<span id='45'>The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;<br/>
<span id='46'>Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;<br/>
<span id='47'>The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,<br/>
<span id='48'>And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.<br/>
<span id='49'>Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,<br/>
<span id='50'>And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,<br/>
<span id='51'>To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,<br/>
<span id='52'>Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.<br/>
<span id='53'>Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,<br/>
<span id='54'>To signify thou camest to bite the world:<br/>
<span id='55'>And, if the rest be true which I have heard,<br/>
<span id='56'>Thou camest&mdash;<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:<br/>
<p><em>Stabs him</em></p>
<span id='58'>For this amongst the rest, was I ordain'd.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.<br/>
<span id='60'>God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!<br/>
<p><em>Dies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster<br/>
<span id='62'>Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.<br/>
<span id='63'>See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!<br/>
<span id='64'>O, may such purple tears be alway shed<br/>
<span id='65'>From those that wish the downfall of our house!<br/>
<span id='66'>If any spark of life be yet remaining,<br/>
<span id='67'>Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:<br/>
<p><em>Stabs him again</em></p>
<span id='68'>I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.<br/>
<span id='69'>Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;<br/>
<span id='70'>For I have often heard my mother say<br/>
<span id='71'>I came into the world with my legs forward:<br/>
<span id='72'>Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,<br/>
<span id='73'>And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?<br/>
<span id='74'>The midwife wonder'd and the women cried<br/>
<span id='75'>'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'<br/>
<span id='76'>And so I was; which plainly signified<br/>
<span id='77'>That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.<br/>
<span id='78'>Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,<br/>
<span id='79'>Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.<br/>
<span id='80'>I have no brother, I am like no brother;<br/>
<span id='81'>And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,<br/>
<span id='82'>Be resident in men like one another<br/>
<span id='83'>And not in me: I am myself alone.<br/>
<span id='84'>Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:<br/>
<span id='85'>But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;<br/>
<span id='86'>For I will buzz abroad such prophecies<br/>
<span id='87'>That Edward shall be fearful of his life,<br/>
<span id='88'>And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.<br/>
<span id='89'>King Henry and the prince his son are gone:<br/>
<span id='90'>Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,<br/>
<span id='91'>Counting myself but bad till I be best.<br/>
<span id='92'>I'll throw thy body in another room<br/>
<span id='93'>And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.<br/>
<p><em>Exit, with the body</em></p>

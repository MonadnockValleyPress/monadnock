<h3>LXVII</h3>
<p>
Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,<br/>
And with his presence grace impiety,<br/>
That sin by him advantage should achieve,<br/>
And lace itself with his society? <br/>
Why should false painting imitate his cheek,<br/>
And steel dead seeming of his living hue?<br/>
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek<br/>
Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?<br/>
Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,<br/>
Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?<br/>
For she hath no exchequer now but his,<br/>
And, proud of many, lives upon his gains.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In days long since, before these last so bad.<br/>

<h1>Henry VI, Part 3</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Coventry.</h4>

<blockquote><em>Enter WARWICK, the Mayor of Coventry, two Messengers, and others upon the walls</em></blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?</span><br/>
<span id='2'>How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>How far off is our brother Montague?</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Where is the post that came from Montague?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SIR JOHN SOMERVILLE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>At Southam I did leave him with his forces,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And do expect him here some two hours hence.</span><br/>
<p><em>Drum heard</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.</span><br/>
<p><em>March: flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, and soldiers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>That we could hear no news of his repair?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And he shall pardon thee these outrages.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Call Warwick patron and be penitent?</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>I thought, at least, he would have said the king;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Or did he make the jest against his will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>I'll do thee service for so good a gift.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>What is the body when the head is off?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>The king was slily finger'd from the deck!</span><br/>
<span id='45'>You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And with the other fling it at thy face,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><em>Enter OXFORD, with drum and colours</em></blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>OXFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!</span><br/>
<p><em>He and his forces enter the city</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>The gates are open, let us enter too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>So other foes may set upon our backs.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Stand we in good array; for they no doubt</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Will issue out again and bid us battle:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>If not, the city being but of small defence,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MONTAGUE with drum and colours</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!</span><br/>
<p><em>He and his forces enter the city</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>The harder match'd, the greater victory:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SOMERSET, with drum and colours</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!</span><br/>
<p><em>He and his forces enter the city</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Have sold their lives unto the house of York;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CLARENCE, with drum and colours</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Of force enough to bid his brother battle;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>With whom an upright zeal to right prevails</span><br/>
<span id='79'>More than the nature of a brother's love!</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Father of Warwick, know you what this means?</span><br/>
<p><em>Taking his red rose out of his hat</em></p>
<span id='82'>Look here, I throw my infamy at thee</span><br/>
<span id='83'>I will not ruinate my father's house,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>To bend the fatal instruments of war</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Against his brother and his lawful king?</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>To keep that oath were more impiety</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>I am so sorry for my trespass made</span><br/>
<span id='93'>That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!</span><br/>
<span id='110'>I will away towards Barnet presently,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt King Edward and his company. March. Warwick and his company follow</em></p>

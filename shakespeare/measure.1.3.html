<h1>Measure for Measure</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</H3>
<h4>A monastery.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMAS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>No, holy father; throw away that thought;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Believe not that the dribbling dart of love</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose</span><br/>
<span id='5'>More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Of burning youth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>FRIAR THOMAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>                  May your grace speak of it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>My holy sir, none better knows than you</span><br/>
<span id='9'>How I have ever loved the life removed</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And held in idle price to haunt assemblies</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>A man of stricture and firm abstinence,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>My absolute power and place here in Vienna,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And so it is received. Now, pious sir,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>You will demand of me why I do this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>FRIAR THOMAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Gladly, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>We have strict statutes and most biting laws.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Only to stick it in their children's sight</span><br/>
<span id='27'>For terror, not to use, in time the rod</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And liberty plucks justice by the nose;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Goes all decorum.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>FRIAR THOMAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>                  It rested in your grace</span><br/>
<span id='34'>To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Than in Lord Angelo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>I do fear, too dreadful:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them</span><br/>
<span id='40'>For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>When evil deeds have their permissive pass</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>I have on Angelo imposed the office;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And yet my nature never in the fight</span><br/>
<span id='46'>To do in slander. And to behold his sway,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Supply me with the habit and instruct me</span><br/>
<span id='50'>How I may formally in person bear me</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Like a true friar. More reasons for this action</span><br/>
<span id='52'>At our more leisure shall I render you;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses</span><br/>
<span id='55'>That his blood flows, or that his appetite</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>If power change purpose, what our seemers be.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

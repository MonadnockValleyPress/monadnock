<h1>Cymbeline</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The same. A public place.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CLOTEN and two Lords</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the</span><br/>
<span id='2'>violence of action hath made you reek as a</span><br/>
<span id='3'>sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>[Aside]  No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be</span><br/>
<span id='8'>not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>[Aside]  His steel was in debt; it went o' the</span><br/>
<span id='10'>backside the town.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>The villain would not stand me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>[Aside]  No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but</span><br/>
<span id='14'>he added to your having; gave you some ground.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>[Aside]  As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>I would they had not come between us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>[Aside]  So would I, till you had measured how long</span><br/>
<span id='18'>a fool you were upon the ground.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>[Aside]  If it be a sin to make a true election, she</span><br/>
<span id='21'>is damned.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain</span><br/>
<span id='23'>go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen</span><br/>
<span id='24'>small reflection of her wit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>[Aside]  She shines not upon fools, lest the</span><br/>
<span id='26'>reflection should hurt her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some</span><br/>
<span id='28'>hurt done!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>[Aside]  I wish not so; unless it had been the fall</span><br/>
<span id='30'>of an ass, which is no great hurt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>You'll go with us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I'll attend your lordship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Nay, come, let's go together.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Well, my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

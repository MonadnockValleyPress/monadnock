<h1>Richard III</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the DUCHESS OF YORK, with the two children of CLARENCE</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Boy</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>No, boy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Boy</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Girl</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Why do you look on us, and shake your head,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And call us wretches, orphans, castaways</span><br/>
<span id='7'>If that our noble father be alive?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>I do lament the sickness of the king.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>As loath to lose him, not your father's death;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Boy</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The king my uncle is to blame for this:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>God will revenge it; whom I will importune</span><br/>
<span id='15'>With daily prayers all to that effect.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Girl</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>And so will I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Incapable and shallow innocents,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>You cannot guess who caused your father's death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Boy</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Devised impeachments to imprison him:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And when my uncle told me so, he wept,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Bade me rely on him as on my father,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And he would love me dearly as his child.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!</span><br/>
<span id='29'>He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Boy</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Ay, boy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Boy</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her ears; RIVERS, and DORSET after her</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>To chide my fortune, and torment myself?</span><br/>
<span id='36'>I'll join with black despair against my soul,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And to myself become an enemy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>What means this scene of rude impatience?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>To make an act of tragic violence:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?</span><br/>
<span id='43'>If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Or, like obedient subjects, follow him</span><br/>
<span id='46'>To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow</span><br/>
<span id='48'>As I had title in thy noble husband!</span><br/>
<span id='49'>I have bewept a worthy husband's death,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And lived by looking on his images:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>But now two mirrors of his princely semblance</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And I for comfort have but one false glass,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Thine being but a moiety of my grief,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Boy</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>How can we aid you with our kindred tears?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Girl</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Give me no help in lamentation;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>I am not barren to bring forth complaints</span><br/>
<span id='68'>All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Children</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Children</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>What stays had I but they? and they are gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Was never widow had so dear a loss!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Children</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Were never orphans had so dear a loss!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Was never mother had so dear a loss!</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Alas, I am the mother of these moans!</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>I for an Edward weep, so do not they:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And I will pamper it with lamentations.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DORSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased</span><br/>
<span id='90'>That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:</span><br/>
<span id='91'>In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>With dull unwilligness to repay a debt</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>For it requires the royal debt it lent you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>RIVERS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Of the young prince your son: send straight for him</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause</span><br/>
<span id='102'>To wail the dimming of our shining star;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>But none can cure their harms by wailing them.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;</span><br/>
<span id='105'>I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee</span><br/>
<span id='106'>I crave your blessing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>[Aside]  Amen; and make me die a good old man!</span><br/>
<span id='110'>That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing:</span><br/>
<span id='111'>I marvel why her grace did leave it out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Now cheer each other in each other's love</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Though we have spent our harvest of this king,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>We are to reap the harvest of his son.</span><br/>
<span id='117'>The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>RIVERS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Which would be so much the more dangerous</span><br/>
<span id='127'>By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Where every horse bears his commanding rein,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And may direct his course as please himself,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>In my opinion, ought to be prevented.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>I hope the king made peace with all of us</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And the compact is firm and true in me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>RIVERS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>And so in me; and so, I think, in all:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Yet, since it is but green, it should be put</span><br/>
<span id='136'>To no apparent likelihood of breach,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Which haply by much company might be urged:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>And so say I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Then be it so; and go we to determine</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Madam, and you, my mother, will you go</span><br/>
<span id='144'>To give your censures in this weighty business?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>With all our hearts.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>For God's sake, let not us two be behind;</span><br/>
<span id='148'>For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>As index to the story we late talk'd of,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>My other self, my counsel's consistory,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>I, like a child, will go by thy direction.</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

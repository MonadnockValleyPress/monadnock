<h1>Timon of Athens</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Scene I. A room in Lucullus' house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>FLAMINIUS waiting. Enter a Servant to him</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>FLAMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>I thank you, sir.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LUCULLUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Here's my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LUCULLUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>[Aside]  One of Lord Timon's men? a gift, I</span><br/>
<span id='5'>warrant. Why, this hits right; I dreamt of a silver</span><br/>
<span id='6'>basin and ewer to-night. Flaminius, honest</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Flaminius; you are very respectively welcome, sir.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Fill me some wine.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Servants</em></p>
<span id='9'>And how does that honourable, complete, free-hearted</span><br/>
<span id='10'>gentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful good lord</span><br/>
<span id='11'>and master?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FLAMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>His health is well sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LUCULLUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>I am right glad that his health is well, sir: and</span><br/>
<span id='14'>what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>FLAMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>'Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir; which, in my</span><br/>
<span id='16'>lord's behalf, I come to entreat your honour to</span><br/>
<span id='17'>supply; who, having great and instant occasion to</span><br/>
<span id='18'>use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to</span><br/>
<span id='19'>furnish him, nothing doubting your present</span><br/>
<span id='20'>assistance therein.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LUCULLUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>La, la, la, la! 'nothing doubting,' says he? Alas,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>good lord! a noble gentleman 'tis, if he would not</span><br/>
<span id='23'>keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha'</span><br/>
<span id='24'>dined with him, and told him on't, and come again to</span><br/>
<span id='25'>supper to him, of purpose to have him spend less,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning</span><br/>
<span id='27'>by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty</span><br/>
<span id='28'>is his: I ha' told him on't, but I could ne'er get</span><br/>
<span id='29'>him from't.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Servant, with wine</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Please your lordship, here is the wine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LUCULLUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here's to thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>FLAMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Your lordship speaks your pleasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LUCULLUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt</span><br/>
<span id='34'>spirit&mdash;give thee thy due&mdash;and one that knows what</span><br/>
<span id='35'>belongs to reason; and canst use the time well, if</span><br/>
<span id='36'>the time use thee well: good parts in thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>To Servant</em></p>
<span id='37'>Get you gone, sirrah.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Servant</em></p>
<span id='38'>Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord's a</span><br/>
<span id='39'>bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise; and thou</span><br/>
<span id='40'>knowest well enough, although thou comest to me,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>that this is no time to lend money, especially upon</span><br/>
<span id='42'>bare friendship, without security. Here's three</span><br/>
<span id='43'>solidares for thee: good boy, wink at me, and say</span><br/>
<span id='44'>thou sawest me not. Fare thee well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>FLAMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Is't possible the world should so much differ,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>To him that worships thee!</span><br/>
<p><em>Throwing the money back</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LUCULLUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Ha! now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>FLAMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>May these add to the number that may scald thee!</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Let moulten coin be thy damnation,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>I feel master's passion! this slave,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Unto his honour, has my lord's meat in him:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>When he is turn'd to poison?</span><br/>
<span id='58'>O, may diseases only work upon't!</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And, when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Which my lord paid for, be of any power</span><br/>
<span id='61'>To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

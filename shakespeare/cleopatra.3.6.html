<h1>Antony and Cleopatra</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene VI</h3>
<h4>Rome. Octavius Caesar's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And all the unlawful issue that their lust</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Since then hath made between them. Unto her</span><br/>
<span id='9'>He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Absolute queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>MECAENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>                  This in the public eye?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>I' the common show-place, where they exercise.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: she</span><br/>
<span id='18'>In the habiliments of the goddess Isis</span><br/>
<span id='19'>That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>As 'tis reported, so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MECAENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Let Rome be thus Inform'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>AGRIPPA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Who, queasy with his insolence</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Already, will their good thoughts call from him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>The people know it; and have now received</span><br/>
<span id='25'>His accusations.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>AGRIPPA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>                  Who does he accuse?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Caesar: and that, having in Sicily</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him</span><br/>
<span id='29'>His part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent me</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Some shipping unrestored: lastly, he frets</span><br/>
<span id='31'>That Lepidus of the triumvirate</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Should be deposed; and, being, that we detain</span><br/>
<span id='33'>All his revenue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>AGRIPPA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>                  Sir, this should be answer'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>That he his high authority abused,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Demand the like.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MECAENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>                  He'll never yield to that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Nor must not then be yielded to in this.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter OCTAVIA with her train</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>OCTAVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>That ever I should call thee castaway!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>OCTAVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Should have an army for an usher, and</span><br/>
<span id='50'>The neighs of horse to tell of her approach</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Raised by your populous troops: but you are come</span><br/>
<span id='56'>A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented</span><br/>
<span id='57'>The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Is often left unloved; we should have met you</span><br/>
<span id='59'>By sea and land; supplying every stage</span><br/>
<span id='60'>With an augmented greeting.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>OCTAVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Good my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did</span><br/>
<span id='63'>On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted</span><br/>
<span id='65'>My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd</span><br/>
<span id='66'>His pardon for return.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Which soon he granted,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>OCTAVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Do not say so, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>I have eyes upon him,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And his affairs come to me on the wind.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Where is he now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>OCTAVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>                  My lord, in Athens.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>No, my most wronged sister; Cleopatra</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Up to a whore; who now are levying</span><br/>
<span id='77'>The kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembled</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>With a more larger list of sceptres.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>OCTAVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Ay me, most wretched,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>That have my heart parted betwixt two friends</span><br/>
<span id='88'>That do afflict each other!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Welcome hither:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Be you not troubled with the time, which drives</span><br/>
<span id='94'>O'er your content these strong necessities;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>But let determined things to destiny</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Nothing more dear to me. You are abused</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>To do you justice, make them ministers</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And ever welcome to us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>AGRIPPA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Welcome, lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>MECAENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Welcome, dear madam.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Only the adulterous Antony, most large</span><br/>
<span id='106'>In his abominations, turns you off;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And gives his potent regiment to a trull,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>That noises it against us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>OCTAVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Is it so, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Most certain. Sister, welcome: pray you,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Titus Andronicus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Rome. Before the Palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter AARON</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>As when the golden sun salutes the morn,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And overlooks the highest-peering hills;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>So Tamora:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Hast prisoner held, fetter'd in amorous chains</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To wait upon this new-made empress.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Holloa! what storm is this?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, braving</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And manners, to intrude where I am graced;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And may, for aught thou know'st, affected be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And so in this, to bear me down with braves.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>'Tis not the difference of a year or two</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>I am as able and as fit as thou</span><br/>
<span id='34'>To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And that my sword upon thee shall approve,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>[Aside]  Clubs, clubs! these lovers will not keep</span><br/>
<span id='38'>the peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Till you know better how to handle it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?</span><br/>
<p><em>They draw</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>[Coming forward]  Why, how now, lords!</span><br/>
<span id='48'>So near the emperor's palace dare you draw,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And maintain such a quarrel openly?</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>I would not for a million of gold</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The cause were known to them it most concerns;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Nor would your noble mother for much more</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>For shame, put up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>                  Not I, till I have sheathed</span><br/>
<span id='57'>My rapier in his bosom and withal</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat</span><br/>
<span id='59'>That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>For that I am prepared and full resolved.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Foul-spoken coward, that thunder'st with thy tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Away, I say!</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>This petty brabble will undo us all.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous</span><br/>
<span id='67'>It is to jet upon a prince's right?</span><br/>
<span id='68'>What, is Lavinia then become so loose,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Or Bassianus so degenerate,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Without controlment, justice, or revenge?</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Young lords, beware! and should the empress know</span><br/>
<span id='73'>This discord's ground, the music would not please.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>I care not, I, knew she and all the world:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>I love Lavinia more than all the world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome</span><br/>
<span id='79'>How furious and impatient they be,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And cannot brook competitors in love?</span><br/>
<span id='81'>I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths</span><br/>
<span id='82'>By this device.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>                  Aaron, a thousand deaths</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>To achieve her! how?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Why makest thou it so strange?</span><br/>
<span id='87'>She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>She is a woman, therefore may be won;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>What, man! more water glideth by the mill</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Than wots the miller of; and easy it is</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>[Aside]  Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Then why should he despair that knows to court it</span><br/>
<span id='97'>With words, fair looks and liberality?</span><br/>
<span id='98'>What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Would serve your turns.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Ay, so the turn were served.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Aaron, thou hast hit it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Would you had hit it too!</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Then should not we be tired with this ado.</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools</span><br/>
<span id='107'>To square for this? would it offend you, then</span><br/>
<span id='108'>That both should speed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Faith, not me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>                  Nor me, so I were one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>'Tis policy and stratagem must do</span><br/>
<span id='113'>That you affect; and so must you resolve,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>That what you cannot as you would achieve,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>You must perforce accomplish as you may.</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>A speedier course than lingering languishment</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Must we pursue, and I have found the path.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>The forest walks are wide and spacious;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>And many unfrequented plots there are</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Fitted by kind for rape and villany:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Single you thither then this dainty doe,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>And strike her home by force, if not by words:</span><br/>
<span id='127'>This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit</span><br/>
<span id='129'>To villany and vengeance consecrate,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Will we acquaint with all that we intend;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And she shall file our engines with advice,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>That will not suffer you to square yourselves,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>But to your wishes' height advance you both.</span><br/>
<span id='134'>The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:</span><br/>
<span id='136'>The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;</span><br/>
<span id='137'>There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take</span><br/>
<span id='138'>your turns;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>And revel in Lavinia's treasury.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice,</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream</span><br/>
<span id='143'>To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits.</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Per Styga, per manes vehor.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

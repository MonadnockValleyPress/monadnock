<h1>Henry IV, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene V</h3>
<h4>Another chamber.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>KING HENRY IV lying on a bed: CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, and others in attendance</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Unless some dull and favourable hand</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Will whisper music to my weary spirit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Call for the music in the other room.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Set me the crown upon my pillow here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>His eye is hollow, and he changes much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Less noise, less noise!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PRINCE HENRY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Who saw the Duke of Clarence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>I am here, brother, full of heaviness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>How now! rain within doors, and none abroad!</span><br/>
<span id='11'>How doth the king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Exceeding ill.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>                  Heard he the good news yet?</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Tell it him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>He alter'd much upon the hearing it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>If he be sick with joy, he'll recover without physic.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Not so much noise, my lords: sweet prince,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>speak low;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>The king your father is disposed to sleep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Let us withdraw into the other room.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Will't please your grace to go along with us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>No; I will sit and watch here by the king.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY</em></p>
<span id='23'>Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Being so troublesome a bedfellow?</span><br/>
<span id='25'>O polish'd perturbation! golden care!</span><br/>
<span id='26'>That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide</span><br/>
<span id='27'>To many a watchful night! sleep with it now!</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet</span><br/>
<span id='29'>As he whose brow with homely biggen bound</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Snores out the watch of night. O majesty!</span><br/>
<span id='31'>When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Like a rich armour worn in heat of day,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>That scalds with safety. By his gates of breath</span><br/>
<span id='34'>There lies a downy feather which stirs not:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Did he suspire, that light and weightless down</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Perforce must move. My gracious lord! my father!</span><br/>
<span id='37'>This sleep is sound indeed, this is a sleep</span><br/>
<span id='38'>That from this golden rigol hath divorced</span><br/>
<span id='39'>So many English kings. Thy due from me</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>My due from thee is this imperial crown,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Which, as immediate as thy place and blood,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Derives itself to me. Lo, here it sits,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Which God shall guard: and put the world's whole strength</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Into one giant arm, it shall not force</span><br/>
<span id='48'>This lineal honour from me: this from thee</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Will I to mine leave, as 'tis left to me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter WARWICK, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and the rest</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Doth the king call?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>What would your majesty? How fares your grace?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>We left the prince my brother here, my liege,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Who undertook to sit and watch by you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>The Prince of Wales! Where is he? let me see him:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>He is not here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>This door is open; he is gone this way.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>He came not through the chamber where we stay'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Where is the crown? who took it from my pillow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>The prince hath ta'en it hence: go, seek him out.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Is he so hasty that he doth suppose</span><br/>
<span id='64'>My sleep my death?</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Find him, my Lord of Warwick; chide him hither.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit WARWICK</em></p>
<span id='66'>This part of his conjoins with my disease,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are!</span><br/>
<span id='68'>How quickly nature falls into revolt</span><br/>
<span id='69'>When gold becomes her object!</span><br/>
<span id='70'>For this the foolish over-careful fathers</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Have broke their sleep with thoughts, their brains with care,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Their bones with industry;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>For this they have engrossed and piled up</span><br/>
<span id='74'>The canker'd heaps of strange-achieved gold;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>For this they have been thoughtful to invest</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Their sons with arts and martial exercises:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>When, like the bee, culling from every flower</span><br/>
<span id='78'>The virtuous sweets,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Our thighs pack'd with wax, our mouths with honey,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>We bring it to the hive, and, like the bees,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Are murdered for our pains. This bitter taste</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Yield his engrossments to the ending father.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter WARWICK</em></p>
<span id='83'>Now, where is he that will not stay so long</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Till his friend sickness hath determined me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>My lord, I found the prince in the next room,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow</span><br/>
<span id='88'>That tyranny, which never quaff'd but blood,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Would, by beholding him, have wash'd his knife</span><br/>
<span id='90'>With gentle eye-drops. He is coming hither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>But wherefore did he take away the crown?</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter PRINCE HENRY</em></p>
<span id='92'>Lo, where he comes. Come hither to me, Harry.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Depart the chamber, leave us here alone.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt WARWICK and the rest</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>I never thought to hear you speak again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair</span><br/>
<span id='98'>That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Thou seek'st the greatness that will o'erwhelm thee.</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignity</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Is held from falling with so weak a wind</span><br/>
<span id='103'>That it will quickly drop: my day is dim.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Were thine without offence; and at my death</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Thou hast seal'd up my expectation:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And thou wilt have me die assured of it.</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>To stab at half an hour of my life.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear</span><br/>
<span id='115'>That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head:</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Only compound me with forgotten dust</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>For now a time is come to mock at form:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Harry the Fifth is crown'd: up, vanity!</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Down, royal state! all you sage counsellors, hence!</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And to the English court assemble now,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>From every region, apes of idleness!</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit</span><br/>
<span id='129'>The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Be happy, he will trouble you no more;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>England shall double gild his treble guilt,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>England shall give him office, honour, might;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>For the fifth Harry from curb'd licence plucks</span><br/>
<span id='134'>The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.</span><br/>
<span id='136'>O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!</span><br/>
<span id='137'>When that my care could not withhold thy riots,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?</span><br/>
<span id='139'>O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>The moist impediments unto my speech,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard</span><br/>
<span id='145'>The course of it so far. There is your crown;</span><br/>
<span id='146'>And He that wears the crown immortally</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Long guard it yours! If I affect it more</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Than as your honour and as your renown,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Let me no more from this obedience rise,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Which my most inward true and duteous spirit</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.</span><br/>
<span id='152'>God witness with me, when I here came in,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>And found no course of breath within your majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>O, let me in my present wildness die</span><br/>
<span id='156'>And never live to show the incredulous world</span><br/>
<span id='157'>The noble change that I have purposed!</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>I spake unto this crown as having sense,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Hath fed upon the body of my father;</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Preserving life in medicine potable;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>But thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Accusing it, I put it on my head,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>To try with it, as with an enemy</span><br/>
<span id='170'>That had before my face murder'd my father,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>The quarrel of a true inheritor.</span><br/>
<span id='172'>But if it did infect my blood with joy,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>If any rebel or vain spirit of mine</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Did with the least affection of a welcome</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Give entertainment to the might of it,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Let God for ever keep it from my head</span><br/>
<span id='178'>And make me as the poorest vassal is</span><br/>
<span id='179'>That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>O my son,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>God put it in thy mind to take it hence,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;</span><br/>
<span id='185'>And hear, I think, the very latest counsel</span><br/>
<span id='186'>That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways</span><br/>
<span id='188'>I met this crown; and I myself know well</span><br/>
<span id='189'>How troublesome it sat upon my head.</span><br/>
<span id='190'>To thee it shall descend with better quiet,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Better opinion, better confirmation;</span><br/>
<span id='192'>For all the soil of the achievement goes</span><br/>
<span id='193'>With me into the earth. It seem'd in me</span><br/>
<span id='194'>But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>And I had many living to upbraid</span><br/>
<span id='196'>My gain of it by their assistances;</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Thou see'st with peril I have answered;</span><br/>
<span id='200'>For all my reign hath been but as a scene</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Acting that argument: and now my death</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;</span><br/>
<span id='204'>So thou the garland wear'st successively.</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;</span><br/>
<span id='207'>And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;</span><br/>
<span id='209'>By whose fell working I was first advanced</span><br/>
<span id='210'>And by whose power I well might lodge a fear</span><br/>
<span id='211'>To be again displaced: which to avoid,</span><br/>
<span id='212'>I cut them off; and had a purpose now</span><br/>
<span id='213'>To lead out many to the Holy Land,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Lest rest and lying still might make them look</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>Be it thy course to busy giddy minds</span><br/>
<span id='217'>With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,</span><br/>
<span id='218'>May waste the memory of the former days.</span><br/>
<span id='219'>More would I, but my lungs are wasted so</span><br/>
<span id='220'>That strength of speech is utterly denied me.</span><br/>
<span id='221'>How I came by the crown, O God forgive;</span><br/>
<span id='222'>And grant it may with thee in true peace live!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='223'>My gracious liege,</span><br/>
<span id='224'>You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Then plain and right must my possession be:</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Which I with more than with a common pain</span><br/>
<span id='227'>'Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Lord John of LANCASTER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>

<span id='speech37'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>

<span id='230'>Thou bring'st me happiness and peace, son John;</span><br/>
<span id='231'>But health, alack, with youthful wings is flown</span><br/>
<span id='232'>From this bare wither'd trunk: upon thy sight</span><br/>

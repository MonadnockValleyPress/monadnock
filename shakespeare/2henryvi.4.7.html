<h1>Henry VI, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene VII</h3>
<h4>London. Smithfield.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Alarums. MATTHEW GOFFE is slain, and all the rest. Then enter CADE, with his company.</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>So, sirs: now go some and pull down the Savoy;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>others to the inns of court; down with them all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>I have a suit unto your lordship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Be it a lordship, thou shalt have it for that word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Only that the laws of England may come out of your mouth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HOLLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>[Aside]  Mass, 'twill be sore law, then; for he was</span><br/>
<span id='7'>thrust in the mouth with a spear, and 'tis not whole</span><br/>
<span id='8'>yet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SMITH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>[Aside]  Nay, John, it will be stinking law for his</span><br/>
<span id='10'>breath stinks with eating toasted cheese.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>I have thought upon it, it shall be so. Away, burn</span><br/>
<span id='12'>all the records of the realm: my mouth shall be</span><br/>
<span id='13'>the parliament of England.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HOLLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>[Aside]  Then we are like to have biting statutes,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>unless his teeth be pulled out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>And henceforward all things shall be in common.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>My lord, a prize, a prize! here's the Lord Say,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>which sold the towns in France; he that made us pay</span><br/>
<span id='19'>one and twenty fifteens, and one shilling to the</span><br/>
<span id='20'>pound, the last subsidy.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BEVIS, with Lord SAY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Well, he shall be beheaded for it ten times. Ah,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>thou say, thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord! now</span><br/>
<span id='23'>art thou within point-blank of our jurisdiction</span><br/>
<span id='24'>regal. What canst thou answer to my majesty for</span><br/>
<span id='25'>giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu, the</span><br/>
<span id='26'>dauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by these</span><br/>
<span id='27'>presence, even the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I</span><br/>
<span id='28'>am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such</span><br/>
<span id='29'>filth as thou art. Thou hast most traitorously</span><br/>
<span id='30'>corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a</span><br/>
<span id='31'>grammar school; and whereas, before, our forefathers</span><br/>
<span id='32'>had no other books but the score and the tally, thou</span><br/>
<span id='33'>hast caused printing to be used, and, contrary to</span><br/>
<span id='34'>the king, his crown and dignity, thou hast built a</span><br/>
<span id='35'>paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face that thou</span><br/>
<span id='36'>hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and</span><br/>
<span id='37'>a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian</span><br/>
<span id='38'>ear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed</span><br/>
<span id='39'>justices of peace, to call poor men before them</span><br/>
<span id='40'>about matters they were not able to answer.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Moreover, thou hast put them in prison; and because</span><br/>
<span id='42'>they could not read, thou hast hanged them; when,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>indeed, only for that cause they have been most</span><br/>
<span id='44'>worthy to live. Thou dost ride in a foot-cloth, dost thou not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>What of that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Marry, thou oughtest not to let thy horse wear a</span><br/>
<span id='47'>cloak, when honester men than thou go in their hose</span><br/>
<span id='48'>and doublets.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>And work in their shirt too; as myself, for example,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>that am a butcher.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>You men of Kent,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>What say you of Kent?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Nothing but this; 'tis 'bona terra, mala gens.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Away with him, away with him! he speaks Latin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Hear me but speak, and bear me where you will.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Kent, in the Commentaries Caesar writ,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Is term'd the civil'st place of this isle:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Sweet is the country, because full of riches;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>The people liberal, valiant, active, wealthy;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Which makes me hope you are not void of pity.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>I sold not Maine, I lost not Normandy,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Yet, to recover them, would lose my life.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Justice with favour have I always done;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Prayers and tears have moved me, gifts could never.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>When have I aught exacted at your hands,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>But to maintain the king, the realm and you?</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Because my book preferr'd me to the king,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Unless you be possess'd with devilish spirits,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>You cannot but forbear to murder me:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>This tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings</span><br/>
<span id='74'>For your behoof,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Tut, when struck'st thou one blow in the field?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struck</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Those that I never saw and struck them dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BEVIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>O monstrous coward! what, to come behind folks?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>SAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>These cheeks are pale for watching for your good.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Give him a box o' the ear and that will make 'em red again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>SAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Long sitting to determine poor men's causes</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Hath made me full of sickness and diseases.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Ye shall have a hempen caudle, then, and the help of hatchet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Why dost thou quiver, man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>SAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>The palsy, and not fear, provokes me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Nay, he nods at us, as who should say, I'll be even</span><br/>
<span id='87'>with you: I'll see if his head will stand steadier</span><br/>
<span id='88'>on a pole, or no. Take him away, and behead him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>SAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Tell me wherein have I offended most?</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Have I affected wealth or honour? speak.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Are my chests fill'd up with extorted gold?</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Whom have I injured, that ye seek my death?</span><br/>
<span id='94'>These hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>O, let me live!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>[Aside]  I feel remorse in myself with his words;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>but I'll bridle it: he shall die, an it be but for</span><br/>
<span id='99'>pleading so well for his life. Away with him! he</span><br/>
<span id='100'>has a familiar under his tongue; he speaks not o'</span><br/>
<span id='101'>God's name. Go, take him away, I say, and strike</span><br/>
<span id='102'>off his head presently; and then break into his</span><br/>
<span id='103'>son-in-law's house, Sir James Cromer, and strike off</span><br/>
<span id='104'>his head, and bring them both upon two poles hither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>ALL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>It shall be done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>SAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Ah, countrymen! if when you make your prayers,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>God should be so obdurate as yourselves,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>How would it fare with your departed souls?</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And therefore yet relent, and save my life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Away with him! and do as I command ye.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt some with Lord SAY</em></p>
<span id='111'>The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head</span><br/>
<span id='112'>on his shoulders, unless he pay me tribute; there</span><br/>
<span id='113'>shall not a maid be married, but she shall pay to me</span><br/>
<span id='114'>her maidenhead ere they have it: men shall hold of</span><br/>
<span id='115'>me in capite; and we charge and command that their</span><br/>
<span id='116'>wives be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>My lord, when shall we go to Cheapside and take up</span><br/>
<span id='118'>commodities upon our bills?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Marry, presently.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>ALL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>O, brave!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter one with the heads</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>But is not this braver? Let them kiss one another,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>for they loved well when they were alive. Now part</span><br/>
<span id='123'>them again, lest they consult about the giving up of</span><br/>
<span id='124'>some more towns in France. Soldiers, defer the</span><br/>
<span id='125'>spoil of the city until night: for with these borne</span><br/>
<span id='126'>before us, instead of maces, will we ride through</span><br/>
<span id='127'>the streets, and at every corner have them kiss. Away!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

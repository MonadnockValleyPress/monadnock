<h1>Othello</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene II</h3>
<h4>A room in the castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>You have seen nothing then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>But then I saw no harm, and then I heard</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Each syllable that breath made up between them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>What, did they never whisper?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Never, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Nor send you out o' the way?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Never.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Never, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>That's strange.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>If any wretch have put this in your head,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!</span><br/>
<span id='18'>For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>There's no man happy; the purest of their wives</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Is foul as slander.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Bid her come hither: go.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit EMILIA</em></p>
<span id='22'>She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd</span><br/>
<span id='23'>That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>A closet lock and key of villanous secrets</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>My lord, what is your will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Pray, chuck, come hither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>What is your pleasure?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Let me see your eyes;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Look in my face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>                  What horrible fancy's this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>[To EMILIA]  Some of your function, mistress;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Leave procreants alone and shut the door;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit EMILIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?</span><br/>
<span id='37'>I understand a fury in your words.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>But not the words.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Why, what art thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Your wife, my lord; your true</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And loyal wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>                  Come, swear it, damn thyself</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Swear thou art honest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Heaven doth truly know it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>O Desdemona! away! away! away!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?</span><br/>
<span id='52'>If haply you my father do suspect</span><br/>
<span id='53'>An instrument of this your calling back,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Lay not your blame on me: if you have lost him,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Why, I have lost him too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Had it pleased heaven</span><br/>
<span id='57'>To try me with affliction; had they rain'd</span><br/>
<span id='58'>All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>I should have found in some place of my soul</span><br/>
<span id='62'>A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me</span><br/>
<span id='63'>A fixed figure for the time of scorn</span><br/>
<span id='64'>To point his slow unmoving finger at!</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Where either I must live, or bear no life;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>The fountain from the which my current runs,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads</span><br/>
<span id='71'>To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Ay, there, look grim as hell!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet</span><br/>
<span id='78'>That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst</span><br/>
<span id='79'>ne'er been born!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Committed! O thou public commoner!</span><br/>
<span id='84'>I should make very forges of my cheeks,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>That would to cinders burn up modesty,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And will not hear it. What committed!</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Impudent strumpet!</span><br/>

<span id='92'>                  By heaven, you do me wrong.</span><br/>

<span id='93'>Are you not a strumpet?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>No, as I am a Christian:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>If to preserve this vessel for my lord</span><br/>
<span id='96'>From any other foul unlawful touch</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.</span><br/>

<span id='speech47'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>

<span id='235'>I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your</span><br/>
<span id='236'>suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,</span><br/>
<span id='237'>Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I</span><br/>
<span id='238'>have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean</span><br/>
<span id='239'>purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if</span><br/>
<span id='240'>thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,</span><br/>
<span id='241'>take me from this world with treachery and devise</span><br/>
<span id='242'>engines for my life.</span><br/>

<span id='speech94'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='243'>Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech95'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='244'>Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice</span><br/>
<span id='245'>to depute Cassio in Othello's place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech96'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='246'>Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona</span><br/>
<span id='247'>return again to Venice.</span><br/>

<span id='speech97'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='248'>O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with</span><br/>
<span id='249'>him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be</span><br/>
<span id='250'>lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be</span><br/>
<span id='251'>so determinate as the removing of Cassio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech98'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='252'>How do you mean, removing of him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech99'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='253'>Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;</span><br/>
<span id='254'>knocking out his brains.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech100'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='255'>And that you would have me to do?</span><br/>

<span id='speech101'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='256'>Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.</span><br/>
<span id='257'>He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I</span><br/>
<span id='258'>go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable</span><br/>
<span id='259'>fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which</span><br/>
<span id='260'>I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,</span><br/>
<span id='261'>you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near</span><br/>
<span id='262'>to second your attempt, and he shall fall between</span><br/>
<span id='263'>us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with</span><br/>
<span id='264'>me; I will show you such a necessity in his death</span><br/>
<span id='265'>that you shall think yourself bound to put it on</span><br/>
<span id='266'>him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows</span><br/>
<span id='267'>to waste: about it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech102'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>

<span id='268'>I will hear further reason for this.</span><br/>

<h1>Henry VIII</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>London. Queen Katharine's apartments.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter QUEEN KATHARINE and her Women, as at work</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Take thy lute, wench: my soul grows sad with troubles;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Sing, and disperse 'em, if thou canst: leave working.</span><br/>
<p><em>SONG</em></p>
<span id='3'>Orpheus with his lute made trees,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And the mountain tops that freeze,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Bow themselves when he did sing:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>To his music plants and flowers</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Ever sprung; as sun and showers</span><br/>
<span id='8'>There had made a lasting spring.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Every thing that heard him play,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Even the billows of the sea,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Hung their heads, and then lay by.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>In sweet music is such art,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Killing care and grief of heart</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Fall asleep, or hearing, die.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Gentleman</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>How now!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>An't please your grace, the two great cardinals</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Wait in the presence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Would they speak with me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>They will'd me say so, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Pray their graces</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To come near.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Gentleman</em></p>
<span id='22'>What can be their business</span><br/>
<span id='23'>With me, a poor weak woman, fall'n from favour?</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I do not like their coming. Now I think on't,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>They should be good men; their affairs as righteous:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>But all hoods make not monks.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Peace to your highness!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Your graces find me here part of a housewife,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>I would be all, against the worst may happen.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>May it please you noble madam, to withdraw</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Into your private chamber, we shall give you</span><br/>
<span id='33'>The full cause of our coming.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Speak it here:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>There's nothing I have done yet, o' my conscience,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Deserves a corner: would all other women</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!</span><br/>
<span id='38'>My lords, I care not, so much I am happy</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Above a number, if my actions</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Were tried by every tongue, every eye saw 'em,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Envy and base opinion set against 'em,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>I know my life so even. If your business</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina</span><br/>
<span id='46'>serenissima,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>O, good my lord, no Latin;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>I am not such a truant since my coming,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>As not to know the language I have lived in:</span><br/>
<span id='50'>A strange tongue makes my cause more strange,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>suspicious;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Pray, speak in English: here are some will thank you,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Believe me, she has had much wrong: lord cardinal,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>The willing'st sin I ever yet committed</span><br/>
<span id='56'>May be absolved in English.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Noble lady,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>I am sorry my integrity should breed,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And service to his majesty and you,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>We come not by the way of accusation,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Nor to betray you any way to sorrow,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>You have too much, good lady; but to know</span><br/>
<span id='65'>How you stand minded in the weighty difference</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Between the king and you; and to deliver,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Like free and honest men, our just opinions</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And comforts to your cause.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Most honour'd madam,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Forgetting, like a good man your late censure</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Both of his truth and him, which was too far,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>His service and his counsel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>[Aside]	To betray me.&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so!</span><br/>
<span id='79'>But how to make ye suddenly an answer,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>More near my life, I fear,&mdash;with my weak wit,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And to such men of gravity and learning,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>In truth, I know not. I was set at work</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Among my maids: full little, God knows, looking</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Either for such men or such business.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>For her sake that I have been,&mdash;for I feel</span><br/>
<span id='87'>The last fit of my greatness,&mdash;good your graces,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Let me have time and counsel for my cause:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Madam, you wrong the king's love with these fears:</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Your hopes and friends are infinite.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>In England</span><br/>
<span id='93'>But little for my profit: can you think, lords,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>That any Englishman dare give me counsel?</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Or be a known friend, 'gainst his highness' pleasure,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>They that must weigh out my afflictions,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>They that my trust must grow to, live not here:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>They are, as all my other comforts, far hence</span><br/>
<span id='101'>In mine own country, lords.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>I would your grace</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>How, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Put your main cause into the king's protection;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be much</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Both for your honour better and your cause;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>You'll part away disgraced.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>He tells you rightly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Ye tell me what ye wish for both,&mdash;my ruin:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge</span><br/>
<span id='114'>That no king can corrupt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Your rage mistakes us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?</span><br/>
<span id='120'>The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?</span><br/>
<span id='122'>I will not wish ye half my miseries;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>I have more charity: but say, I warn'd ye;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed, lest at once</span><br/>
<span id='125'>The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Madam, this is a mere distraction;</span><br/>
<span id='127'>You turn the good we offer into envy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And all such false professors! would you have me&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>If you have any justice, any pity;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Alas, has banish'd me his bed already,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And all the fellowship I hold now with him</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Is only my obedience. What can happen</span><br/>
<span id='137'>To me above this wretchedness? all your studies</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Make me a curse like this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Your fears are worse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Have I lived thus long&mdash;let me speak myself,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Since virtue finds no friends&mdash;a wife, a true one?</span><br/>
<span id='142'>A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Never yet branded with suspicion?</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Have I with all my full affections</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Still met the king? loved him next heaven?</span><br/>
<span id='146'>obey'd him?</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Almost forgot my prayers to content him?</span><br/>
<span id='149'>And am I thus rewarded? 'tis not well, lords.</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Bring me a constant woman to her husband,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>And to that woman, when she has done most,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>To give up willingly that noble title</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Your master wed me to: nothing but death</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Shall e'er divorce my dignities.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Pray, hear me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Would I had never trod this English earth,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.</span><br/>
<span id='163'>What will become of me now, wretched lady!</span><br/>
<span id='164'>I am the most unhappy woman living.</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes!</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>No friend, no hope; no kindred weep for me;</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Almost no grave allow'd me: like the lily,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>That once was mistress of the field and flourish'd,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>I'll hang my head and perish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>If your grace</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>You'ld feel more comfort: why should we, good lady,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Upon what cause, wrong you? alas, our places,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>The way of our profession is against it:</span><br/>
<span id='176'>We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em.</span><br/>
<span id='177'>For goodness' sake, consider what you do;</span><br/>
<span id='178'>How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Grow from the king's acquaintance, by this carriage.</span><br/>
<span id='180'>The hearts of princes kiss obedience,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits</span><br/>
<span id='182'>They swell, and grow as terrible as storms.</span><br/>
<span id='183'>I know you have a gentle, noble temper,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>A soul as even as a calm: pray, think us</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Those we profess, peace-makers, friends, and servants.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>Madam, you'll find it so. You wrong your virtues</span><br/>
<span id='187'>With these weak women's fears: a noble spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>As yours was put into you, ever casts</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The king loves you;</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Beware you lose it not: for us, if you please</span><br/>
<span id='191'>To trust us in your business, we are ready</span><br/>
<span id='192'>To use our utmost  studies in your service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>Do what ye will, my lords: and, pray, forgive me,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>If I have used myself unmannerly;</span><br/>
<span id='195'>You know I am a woman, lacking wit</span><br/>
<span id='196'>To make a seemly answer to such persons.</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Pray, do my service to his majesty:</span><br/>
<span id='198'>He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers</span><br/>
<span id='199'>While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>That little thought, when she set footing here,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>She should have bought her dignities so dear.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

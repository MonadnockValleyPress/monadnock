<h1>Henry VI, Part 3</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene II</h3>
<h4>A field of battle near Barnet.</h4>

<blockquote><em>Alarum and excursions. Enter KING EDWARD IV, bringing forth WARWICK wounded</em></blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;<br/>
<span id='2'>For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.<br/>
Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee,<br/>
<span id='4'>That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.<br/>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><em>Exit</em></blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,<br/>
<span id='6'>And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?<br/>
<span id='7'>Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,<br/>
<span id='8'>My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.<br/>
<span id='9'>That I must yield my body to the earth<br/>
And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.<br/>
<span id='11'>Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,<br/>
<span id='12'>Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,<br/>
<span id='13'>Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,<br/>
<span id='14'>Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree<br/>
<span id='15'>And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.<br/>
<span id='16'>These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,<br/>
<span id='17'>Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,<br/>
<span id='18'>To search the secret treasons of the world:<br/>
<span id='19'>The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,<br/>
<span id='20'>Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;<br/>
<span id='21'>For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?<br/>
<span id='22'>And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?<br/>
Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!<br/>
<span id='24'>My parks, my walks, my manors that I had.<br/>
<span id='25'>Even now forsake me, and of all my lands<br/>
<span id='26'>Is nothing left me but my body's length.<br/>
Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?<br/>
And, live we how we can, yet die we must.<br/>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><em>Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET</em></blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are.<br/>
<span id='30'>We might recover all our loss again;<br/>
<span id='31'>The queen from France hath brought a puissant power:<br/>
<span id='32'>Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly!<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,<br/>
<span id='34'>If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand.<br/>
<span id='35'>And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!<br/>
<span id='36'>Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst,<br/>
<span id='37'>Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood<br/>
<span id='38'>That glues my lips and will not let me speak.<br/>
<span id='39'>Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;<br/>
<span id='41'>And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,<br/>
<span id='42'>And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'<br/>
<span id='43'>And more he would have said, and more he spoke,<br/>
<span id='44'>Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,<br/>
<span id='45'>That mought not be distinguished; but at last<br/>
<span id='46'>I well might hear, delivered with a groan,<br/>
'O, farewell, Warwick!'<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;<br/>
<span id='49'>For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.<br/>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><em>Dies</em></blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>OXFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!<br/>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><em>Here they bear away his body. Exeunt</em></blockquote>

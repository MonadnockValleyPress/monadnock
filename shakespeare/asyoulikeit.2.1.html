<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>The Forest of Arden.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords, like foresters</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Hath not old custom made this life more sweet</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods</span><br/>
<span id='4'>More free from peril than the envious court?</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>The seasons' difference, as the icy fang</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say</span><br/>
<span id='10'>'This is no flattery: these are counsellors</span><br/>
<span id='11'>That feelingly persuade me what I am.'</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Sweet are the uses of adversity,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And this our life exempt from public haunt</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Sermons in stones and good in every thing.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I would not change it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>AMIENS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Happy is your grace,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>That can translate the stubbornness of fortune</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Into so quiet and so sweet a style.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Come, shall we go and kill us venison?</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Being native burghers of this desert city,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Should in their own confines with forked heads</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Have their round haunches gored.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Indeed, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Did steal behind him as he lay along</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Under an oak whose antique root peeps out</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>The wretched animal heaved forth such groans</span><br/>
<span id='39'>That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Almost to bursting, and the big round tears</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Coursed one another down his innocent nose</span><br/>
<span id='42'>In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Augmenting it with tears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>But what said Jaques?</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Did he not moralize this spectacle?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>O, yes, into a thousand similes.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>First, for his weeping into the needless stream;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament</span><br/>
<span id='51'>As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more</span><br/>
<span id='52'>To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part</span><br/>
<span id='55'>The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Full of the pasture, jumps along by him</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Thus most invectively he pierceth through</span><br/>
<span id='62'>The body of the country, city, court,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>To fright the animals and to kill them up</span><br/>
<span id='66'>In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>And did you leave him in this contemplation?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>We did, my lord, weeping and commenting</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Upon the sobbing deer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Show me the place:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>I love to cope him in these sullen fits,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>For then he's full of matter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>I'll bring you to him straight.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

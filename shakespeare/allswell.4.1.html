<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Without the Florentine camp.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other Soldiers in ambush</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.</span><br/>
<span id='2'>When you sally upon him, speak what terrible</span><br/>
<span id='3'>language you will: though you understand it not</span><br/>
<span id='4'>yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to</span><br/>
<span id='5'>understand him, unless some one among us whom we</span><br/>
<span id='6'>must produce for an interpreter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Good captain, let me be the interpreter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>No, sir, I warrant you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>First Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>E'en such as you speak to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>He must think us some band of strangers i' the</span><br/>
<span id='13'>adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of</span><br/>
<span id='14'>all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every</span><br/>
<span id='15'>one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we</span><br/>
<span id='16'>speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to</span><br/>
<span id='17'>know straight our purpose: choughs' language,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>and then to return and swear the lies he forges.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PAROLLES</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be</span><br/>
<span id='23'>time enough to go home. What shall I say I have</span><br/>
<span id='24'>done? It must be a very plausive invention that</span><br/>
<span id='25'>carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces</span><br/>
<span id='26'>have of late knocked too often at my door. I find</span><br/>
<span id='27'>my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the</span><br/>
<span id='28'>fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not</span><br/>
<span id='29'>daring the reports of my tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue</span><br/>
<span id='31'>was guilty of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>What the devil should move me to undertake the</span><br/>
<span id='33'>recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the</span><br/>
<span id='34'>impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I</span><br/>
<span id='35'>must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in</span><br/>
<span id='36'>exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they</span><br/>
<span id='37'>will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great</span><br/>
<span id='38'>ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the</span><br/>
<span id='39'>instance? Tongue, I must put you into a</span><br/>
<span id='40'>butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Is it possible he should know what he is, and be</span><br/>
<span id='43'>that he is?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>I would the cutting of my garments would serve the</span><br/>
<span id='45'>turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>We cannot afford you so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in</span><br/>
<span id='48'>stratagem.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>'Twould not do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Hardly serve.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>How deep?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Thirty fathom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear</span><br/>
<span id='57'>I recovered it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>You shall hear one anon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>A drum now of the enemy's,&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>Alarum within</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>O, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.</span><br/>
<p><em>They seize and blindfold him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>First Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Boskos thromuldo boskos.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>I know you are the Muskos' regiment:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And I shall lose my life for want of language;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Italian, or French, let him speak to me; I'll</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Discover that which shall undo the Florentine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>First Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak</span><br/>
<span id='70'>thy tongue. Kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thy</span><br/>
<span id='71'>faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>O!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>First Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Oscorbidulchos volivorco.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>First Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>The general is content to spare thee yet;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on</span><br/>
<span id='77'>To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Something to save thy life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>O, let me live!</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak that</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Which you will wonder at.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>First Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>But wilt thou faithfully?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>If I do not, damn me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>First Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Acordo linta.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Come on; thou art granted space.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit, with PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Till we do hear from them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Second Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Captain, I will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>A' will betray us all unto ourselves:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Inform on that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Second Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>                  So I will, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

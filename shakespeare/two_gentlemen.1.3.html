<h1>Two Gentlemen of Verona</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The same. Antonio's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PANTHINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Why, what of him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PANTHINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>                  He wonder'd that your lordship</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>While other men, of slender reputation,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Some to discover islands far away;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Some to the studious universities.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>For any or for all these exercises,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>He said that Proteus your son was meet,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And did request me to importune you</span><br/>
<span id='15'>To let him spend his time no more at home,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Which would be great impeachment to his age,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>In having known no travel in his youth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Nor need'st thou much importune me to that</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Whereon this month I have been hammering.</span><br/>
<span id='20'>I have consider'd well his loss of time</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And how he cannot be a perfect man,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Experience is by industry achieved</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And perfected by the swift course of time.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PANTHINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>I think your lordship is not ignorant</span><br/>
<span id='27'>How his companion, youthful Valentine,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Attends the emperor in his royal court.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>I know it well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PANTHINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And be in eye of every exercise</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>The execution of it shall make known.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Even with the speediest expedition</span><br/>
<span id='39'>I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PANTHINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>With other gentlemen of good esteem,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Are journeying to salute the emperor</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And to commend their service to his will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Good company; with them shall Proteus go:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And, in good time! now will we break with him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PROTEUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>To seal our happiness with their consents!</span><br/>
<span id='51'>O heavenly Julia!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>How now! what letter are you reading there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Of commendations sent from Valentine,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Lend me the letter; let me see what news.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>There is no news, my lord, but that he writes</span><br/>
<span id='58'>How happily he lives, how well beloved</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And daily graced by the emperor;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>And how stand you affected to his wish?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>As one relying on your lordship's will</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And not depending on his friendly wish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>My will is something sorted with his wish.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>For what I will, I will, and there an end.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time</span><br/>
<span id='68'>With Valentinus in the emperor's court:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>What maintenance he from his friends receives,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>To-morrow be in readiness to go:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Please you, deliberate a day or two.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd</span><br/>
<span id='78'>To hasten on his expedition.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Lest he should take exceptions to my love;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And with the vantage of mine own excuse</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Hath he excepted most against my love.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>O, how this spring of love resembleth</span><br/>
<span id='86'>The uncertain glory of an April day,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And by and by a cloud takes all away!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter PANTHINO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PANTHINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Sir Proteus, your father calls for you:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>He is in haste; therefore, I pray you to go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

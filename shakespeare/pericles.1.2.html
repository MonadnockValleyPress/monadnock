<blockquote>
<span id='1'>[To Lords without]  Let none disturb us.&mdash;Why should</span><br/>
<span id='2'>this change of thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Be my so used a guest as not an hour,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>That have their first conception by mis-dread,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Have after-nourishment and life by care;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And what was first but fear what might be done,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Grows elder now and cares it be not done.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And so with me: the great Antiochus,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Since he's so great can make his will his act,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Nor boots it me to say I honour him.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>If he suspect I may dishonour him:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And what may make him blush in being known,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>He'll stop the course by which it might be known;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And with the ostent of war will look so huge,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Amazement shall drive courage from the state;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Which care of them, not pity of myself,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Who am no more but as the tops of trees,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And punish that before that he would punish.</span><br/>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>

<span id='35'>Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!</span><br/>

<span id='36'>And keep your mind, till you return to us,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Peaceful and comfortable!</span><br/>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>They do abuse the king that flatter him:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>The thing which is flatter'd, but a spark,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>He flatters you, makes war upon your life.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>I cannot be much lower than my knees.</span><br/>

<span id='49'>All leave us else; but let your cares o'erlook</span><br/>

<p><em>Exeunt Lords</em></p>
<span id='52'>Helicanus, thou</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Hast moved us: what seest thou in our looks?</span><br/>

<span id='54'>An angry brow, dread lord.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='55'>If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?</span><br/>

<span id='58'>They have their nourishment?</span><br/>

<span id='61'>[Kneeling]</span><br/>

<span id='64'>Rise, prithee, rise.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Sit down: thou art no flatterer:</span><br/>

<span id='67'>That kings should let their ears hear their</span><br/>
<span id='68'>faults hid!</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant,</span><br/>

<span id='72'>To bear with patience</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>That minister'st a potion unto me</span><br/>
<span id='76'>That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>From whence an issue I might propagate,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>The rest&mdash;hark in thine ear&mdash;as black as incest:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Seem'd not to strike, but smooth: but thou</span><br/>
<span id='86'>know'st this,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Under the covering of a careful night,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>That I should open to the listening air</span><br/>
<span id='96'>How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>When all, for mine, if I may call offence,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Which love to all, of which thyself art one,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Who now reprovest me for it,&mdash;</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts</span><br/>
<span id='107'>How I might stop this tempest ere it came;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And finding little comfort to relieve them,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>I thought it princely charity to grieve them.</span><br/>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>

<span id='110'>Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Who either by public war or private treason</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Will take away your life.</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Till that his rage and anger be forgot,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Your rule direct to any; if to me.</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.</span><br/>

<span id='124'>Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tarsus</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Intend my travel, where I'll hear from thee;</span><br/>
<span id='126'>And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.</span><br/>
<span id='127'>The care I had and have of subjects' good</span><br/>
<span id='128'>On thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>That time of both this truth shall ne'er convince,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Thou show'dst a subject's shine, I a true prince.</span><br/>

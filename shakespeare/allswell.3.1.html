<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Florence. The Duke's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Flourish. Enter the DUKE of Florence attended; the two Frenchmen, with a troop of soldiers.</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>So that from point to point now have you heard</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The fundamental reasons of this war,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Whose great decision hath much blood let forth</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And more thirsts after.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Holy seems the quarrel</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Upon your grace's part; black and fearful</span><br/>
<span id='7'>On the opposer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Therefore we marvel much our cousin France</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Would in so just a business shut his bosom</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Against our borrowing prayers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Good my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The reasons of our state I cannot yield,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>But like a common and an outward man,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>That the great figure of a council frames</span><br/>
<span id='15'>By self-unable motion: therefore dare not</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Say what I think of it, since I have found</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Myself in my incertain grounds to fail</span><br/>
<span id='18'>As often as I guess'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Be it his pleasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>But I am sure the younger of our nature,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>That surfeit on their ease, will day by day</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Come here for physic.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DUKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Welcome shall they be;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And all the honours that can fly from us</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Shall on them settle. You know your places well;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>When better fall, for your avails they fell:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>To-morrow to the field.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish. Exeunt</em></p>

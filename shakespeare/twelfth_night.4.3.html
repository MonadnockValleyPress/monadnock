<h1>Twelfth Night</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene III</H3>
<h4>Olivia's garden.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter SEBASTIAN</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>This is the air; that is the glorious sun;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I could not find him at the Elephant:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>That he did range the town to seek me out.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>His counsel now might do me golden service;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>For though my soul disputes well with my sense,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>That this may be some error, but no madness,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune</span><br/>
<span id='12'>So far exceed all instance, all discourse,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>That I am ready to distrust mine eyes</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And wrangle with my reason that persuades me</span><br/>
<span id='15'>To any other trust but that I am mad</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Or else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>She could not sway her house, command her followers,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Take and give back affairs and their dispatch</span><br/>
<span id='19'>With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing</span><br/>
<span id='20'>As I perceive she does: there's something in't</span><br/>
<span id='21'>That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter OLIVIA and Priest</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Now go with me and with this holy man</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Into the chantry by: there, before him,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And underneath that consecrated roof,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Plight me the full assurance of your faith;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>That my most jealous and too doubtful soul</span><br/>
<span id='28'>May live at peace. He shall conceal it</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>What time we will our celebration keep</span><br/>
<span id='31'>According to my birth. What do you say?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I'll follow this good man, and go with you;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>That they may fairly note this act of mine!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

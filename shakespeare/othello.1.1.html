<h1>Othello</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Venice. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter RODERIGO and IAGO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly</span><br/>
<span id='2'>That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</span><br/>
<span id='3'>As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>'Sblood, but you will not hear me:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Evades them, with a bombast circumstance</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And, in conclusion,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>'I have already chose my officer.'</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And what was he?</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>That never set a squadron in the field,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Nor the division of a battle knows</span><br/>
<span id='23'>More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Wherein the toged consuls can propose</span><br/>
<span id='25'>As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</span><br/>
<span id='28'>At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd</span><br/>
<span id='30'>By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And I&mdash;God bless the mark!&mdash;his Moorship's ancient.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Preferment goes by letter and affection,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And not by old gradation, where each second</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Whether I in any just term am affined</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To love the Moor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>I would not follow him then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>O, sir, content you;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>I follow him to serve my turn upon him:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Do well thrive by them and when they have lined</span><br/>
<span id='54'>their coats</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>In following him, I follow but myself;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>But seeming so, for my peculiar end:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>For when my outward action doth demonstrate</span><br/>
<span id='63'>The native act and figure of my heart</span><br/>
<span id='64'>In compliment extern, 'tis not long after</span><br/>
<span id='65'>But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</span><br/>
<span id='66'>For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>What a full fortune does the thicklips owe</span><br/>
<span id='68'>If he can carry't thus!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Call up her father,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>As it may lose some colour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell</span><br/>
<span id='78'>As when, by night and negligence, the fire</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Is spied in populous cities.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Thieves! thieves!</span><br/>
<p><em>BRABANTIO appears above, at a window</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>What is the reason of this terrible summons?</span><br/>
<span id='85'>What is the matter there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Signior, is all your family within?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Are your doors lock'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Why, wherefore ask you this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on</span><br/>
<span id='90'>your gown;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Even now, now, very now, an old black ram</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Arise, I say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>                  What, have you lost your wits?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Not I	what are you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>My name is Roderigo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>The worser welcome:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:</span><br/>
<span id='103'>In honest plainness thou hast heard me say</span><br/>
<span id='104'>My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Being full of supper and distempering draughts,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come</span><br/>
<span id='107'>To start my quiet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Sir, sir, sir,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>                  But thou must needs be sure</span><br/>
<span id='110'>My spirit and my place have in them power</span><br/>
<span id='111'>To make this bitter to thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Patience, good sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>My house is not a grange.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Most grave Brabantio,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>In simple and pure soul I come to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not</span><br/>
<span id='118'>serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to</span><br/>
<span id='119'>do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll</span><br/>
<span id='120'>have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have</span><br/>
<span id='122'>coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>What profane wretch art thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter</span><br/>
<span id='125'>and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Thou art a villain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>You are&mdash;a senator.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Transported, with no worse nor better guard</span><br/>
<span id='134'>But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='136'>If this be known to you and your allowance,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;</span><br/>
<span id='138'>But if you know not this, my manners tell me</span><br/>
<span id='139'>We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</span><br/>
<span id='140'>That, from the sense of all civility,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>I say again, hath made a gross revolt;</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes</span><br/>
<span id='145'>In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:</span><br/>
<span id='147'>If she be in her chamber or your house,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Let loose on me the justice of the state</span><br/>
<span id='149'>For thus deluding you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Strike on the tinder, ho!</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Give me a taper! call up all my people!</span><br/>
<span id='152'>This accident is not unlike my dream:</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Belief of it oppresses me already.</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Light, I say! light!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit above</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>Farewell; for I must leave you:</span><br/>
<span id='156'>It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>To be produced&mdash;as, if I stay, I shall&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>However this may gall him with some cheque,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd</span><br/>
<span id='161'>With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Another of his fathom they have none,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>To lead their business: in which regard,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Yet, for necessity of present life,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>I must show out a flag and sign of love,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;</span><br/>
<span id='170'>And there will I be with him. So, farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>It is too true an evil: gone she is;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And what's to come of my despised time</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!</span><br/>
<span id='175'>With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!</span><br/>
<span id='176'>How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Truly, I think they are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds</span><br/>
<span id='182'>By what you see them act. Is there not charms</span><br/>
<span id='183'>By which the property of youth and maidhood</span><br/>
<span id='184'>May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Of some such thing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>Yes, sir, I have indeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Some one way, some another. Do you know</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>I think I can discover him, if you please,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>To get good guard and go along with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;</span><br/>
<span id='193'>I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!</span><br/>
<span id='194'>And raise some special officers of night.</span><br/>
<span id='195'>On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

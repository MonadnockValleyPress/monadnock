<h1>Antony and Cleopatra</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Rome. Octavius Caesar's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter, LEPIDUS, and their Train</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Our great competitor: from Alexandria</span><br/>
<span id='4'>This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes</span><br/>
<span id='5'>The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy</span><br/>
<span id='7'>More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there</span><br/>
<span id='9'>A man who is the abstract of all faults</span><br/>
<span id='10'>That all men follow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>I must not think there are</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Evils enow to darken all his goodness:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Than what he chooses.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet</span><br/>
<span id='22'>With knaves that smell of sweat: say this</span><br/>
<span id='23'>becomes him,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>As his composure must be rare indeed</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Whom these things cannot blemish,&mdash;yet must Antony</span><br/>
<span id='26'>No way excuse his soils, when we do bear</span><br/>
<span id='27'>So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd</span><br/>
<span id='28'>His vacancy with his voluptuousness,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Call on him for't: but to confound such time,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud</span><br/>
<span id='32'>As his own state and ours,&mdash;'tis to be chid</span><br/>
<span id='33'>As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And so rebel to judgment.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Here's more news.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report</span><br/>
<span id='39'>How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And it appears he is beloved of those</span><br/>
<span id='41'>That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports</span><br/>
<span id='42'>The discontents repair, and men's reports</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Give him much wrong'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>I should have known no less.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>It hath been taught us from the primal state,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>That he which is was wish'd until he were;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>To rot itself with motion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Caesar, I bring thee word,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound</span><br/>
<span id='55'>With keels of every kind: many hot inroads</span><br/>
<span id='56'>They make in Italy; the borders maritime</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Than could his war resisted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Antony,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Though daintily brought up, with patience more</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink</span><br/>
<span id='68'>The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign</span><br/>
<span id='70'>The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps</span><br/>
<span id='73'>It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Which some did die to look on: and all this&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>It wounds thine honour that I speak it now&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek</span><br/>
<span id='77'>So much as lank'd not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>'Tis pity of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Let his shames quickly</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Assemble we immediate council: Pompey</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Thrives in our idleness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>To-morrow, Caesar,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Both what by sea and land I can be able</span><br/>
<span id='87'>To front this present time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Till which encounter,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>It is my business too. Farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>To let me be partaker.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Doubt not, sir;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>I knew it for my bond.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

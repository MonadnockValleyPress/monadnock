<em>Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY, FANG and his Boy with her, and SNARE following.</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Master Fang, have you entered the action?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>FANG</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>It is entered.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Where's your yeoman? Is't a lusty yeoman? will a'</span><br/>
<span id='4'>stand to 't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>FANG</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Sirrah, where's Snare?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>O Lord, ay! good Master Snare.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SNARE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Here, here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>FANG</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Yea, good Master Snare; I have entered him and all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SNARE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>It may chance cost some of us our lives, for he will stab.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Alas the day! take heed of him; he stabbed me in</span><br/>
<span id='12'>mine own house, and that most beastly: in good</span><br/>
<span id='13'>faith, he cares not what mischief he does. If his</span><br/>
<span id='14'>weapon be out: he will foin like any devil; he will</span><br/>
<span id='15'>spare neither man, woman, nor child.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>FANG</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>No, nor I neither: I'll be at your elbow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>FANG</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>An I but fist him once; an a' come but within my vice,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>I am undone by his going; I warrant you, he's an</span><br/>
<span id='20'>infinitive thing upon my score. Good Master Fang,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>hold him sure: good Master Snare, let him not</span><br/>
<span id='22'>'scape. A' comes continuantly to Pie-corner&mdash;saving</span><br/>
<span id='23'>your manhoods&mdash;to buy a saddle; and he is indited to</span><br/>
<span id='24'>dinner to the Lubber's-head in Lumbert street, to</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Master Smooth's the silkman: I pray ye, since my</span><br/>
<span id='26'>exion is entered and my case so openly known to the</span><br/>
<span id='27'>world, let him be brought in to his answer. A</span><br/>
<span id='28'>hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to</span><br/>
<span id='29'>bear: and I have borne, and borne, and borne, and</span><br/>
<span id='30'>have been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbed</span><br/>
<span id='31'>off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame</span><br/>
<span id='32'>to be thought on. There is no honesty in such</span><br/>
<span id='33'>dealing; unless a woman should be made an ass and a</span><br/>
<span id='34'>beast, to bear every knave's wrong. Yonder he</span><br/>
<span id='35'>comes; and that errant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>with him. Do your offices, do your offices: Master</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Fang and Master Snare, do me, do me, do me your offices.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter FALSTAFF, Page, and BARDOLPH</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>How now! whose mare's dead? what's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>FANG</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Sir John, I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Away, varlets! Draw, Bardolph: cut me off the</span><br/>
<span id='41'>villain's head: throw the quean in the channel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Throw me in the channel! I'll throw thee in the</span><br/>
<span id='43'>channel. Wilt thou? wilt thou? thou bastardly</span><br/>
<span id='44'>rogue! Murder, murder! Ah, thou honeysuckle</span><br/>
<span id='45'>villain! wilt thou kill God's officers and the</span><br/>
<span id='46'>king's? Ah, thou honey-seed rogue! thou art a</span><br/>
<span id='47'>honey-seed, a man-queller, and a woman-queller.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Keep them off, Bardolph.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>FANG</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>A rescue! a rescue!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Good people, bring a rescue or two. Thou wo't, wo't</span><br/>
<span id='51'>thou? Thou wo't, wo't ta? do, do, thou rogue! do,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>thou hemp-seed!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Away, you scullion! you rampallion! You</span><br/>
<span id='54'>fustilarian! I'll tickle your catastrophe.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the Lord Chief-Justice, and his men</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>What is the matter? keep the peace here, ho!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Good my lord, be good to me. I beseech you, stand to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>How now, Sir John! what are you brawling here?</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Doth this become your place, your time and business?</span><br/>
<span id='59'>You should have been well on your way to York.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Stand from him, fellow: wherefore hang'st upon him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>O most worshipful lord, an't please your grace, I am</span><br/>
<span id='62'>a poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested at my suit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>For what sum?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of</span><br/>
<span id='67'>his: but I will have some of it out again, or I</span><br/>
<span id='68'>will ride thee o' nights like the mare.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>I think I am as like to ride the mare, if I have</span><br/>
<span id='70'>any vantage of ground to get up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>How comes this, Sir John? Fie! what man of good</span><br/>
<span id='72'>temper would endure this tempest of exclamation?</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so</span><br/>
<span id='74'>rough a course to come by her own?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>What is the gross sum that I owe thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the</span><br/>
<span id='77'>money too. Thou didst swear to me upon a</span><br/>
<span id='78'>parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, upon</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the prince broke</span><br/>
<span id='81'>thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Windsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I was</span><br/>
<span id='83'>washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady</span><br/>
<span id='84'>thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Keech, the butcher's wife, come in then and call me</span><br/>
<span id='86'>gossip Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess of</span><br/>
<span id='87'>vinegar; telling us she had a good dish of prawns;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>whereby thou didst desire to eat some; whereby I</span><br/>
<span id='89'>told thee they were ill for a green wound? And</span><br/>
<span id='90'>didst thou not, when she was gone down stairs,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>desire me to be no more so familiarity with such</span><br/>
<span id='92'>poor people; saying that ere long they should call</span><br/>
<span id='93'>me madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid me</span><br/>
<span id='94'>fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy</span><br/>
<span id='95'>book-oath: deny it, if thou canst.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>My lord, this is a poor mad soul; and she says up</span><br/>
<span id='97'>and down the town that the eldest son is like you:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>she hath been in good case, and the truth is,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>poverty hath distracted her. But for these foolish</span><br/>
<span id='100'>officers, I beseech you I may have redress against them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your</span><br/>
<span id='102'>manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It</span><br/>
<span id='103'>is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words</span><br/>
<span id='104'>that come with such more than impudent sauciness</span><br/>
<span id='105'>from you, can thrust me from a level consideration:</span><br/>
<span id='106'>you have, as it appears to me, practised upon the</span><br/>
<span id='107'>easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her</span><br/>
<span id='108'>serve your uses both in purse and in person.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Yea, in truth, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her, and</span><br/>
<span id='111'>unpay the villany you have done her: the one you</span><br/>
<span id='112'>may do with sterling money, and the other with</span><br/>
<span id='113'>current repentance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without</span><br/>
<span id='115'>reply. You call honourable boldness impudent</span><br/>
<span id='116'>sauciness: if a man will make courtesy and say</span><br/>
<span id='117'>nothing, he is virtuous: no, my lord, my humble</span><br/>
<span id='118'>duty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I say</span><br/>
<span id='119'>to you, I do desire deliverance from these officers,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>being upon hasty employment in the king's affairs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>You speak as having power to do wrong: but answer</span><br/>
<span id='122'>in the effect of your reputation, and satisfy this</span><br/>
<span id='123'>poor woman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Come hither, hostess.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GOWER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Now, Master Gower, what news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>GOWER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>The king, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Are near at hand: the rest the paper tells.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>As I am a gentleman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Faith, you said so before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>As I am a gentleman. Come, no more words of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be fain</span><br/>
<span id='132'>to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my</span><br/>
<span id='133'>dining-chambers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Glasses, glasses is the only drinking: and for thy</span><br/>
<span id='135'>walls, a pretty slight drollery, or the story of</span><br/>
<span id='136'>the Prodigal, or the German hunting in water-work,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>is worth a thousand of these bed-hangings and these</span><br/>
<span id='138'>fly-bitten tapestries. Let it be ten pound, if thou</span><br/>
<span id='139'>canst. Come, an 'twere not for thy humours, there's</span><br/>
<span id='140'>not a better wench in England. Go, wash thy face,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>and draw the action. Come, thou must not be in</span><br/>
<span id='142'>this humour with me; dost not know me? come, come, I</span><br/>
<span id='143'>know thou wast set on to this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Pray thee, Sir John, let it be but twenty nobles: i'</span><br/>
<span id='145'>faith, I am loath to pawn my plate, so God save me,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>la!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Let it alone; I'll make other shift: you'll be a</span><br/>
<span id='148'>fool still.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Well, you shall have it, though I pawn my gown. I</span><br/>
<span id='150'>hope you'll come to supper. You'll pay me all together?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Will I live?</span><br/>
<p><em>To BARDOLPH</em></p>
<span id='152'>Go, with her, with her; hook on, hook on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>

<span id='154'>No more words; let's have her.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt MISTRESS QUICKLY, BARDOLPH, Officers and Boy</em></p>

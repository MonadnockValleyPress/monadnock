<h1>Titus Andronicus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Rome. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Judges, Senators and Tribunes, with MARTIUS  and QUINTUS, bound, passing on to the place of execution; TITUS going before, pleading</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!</span><br/>
<span id='2'>For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent</span><br/>
<span id='3'>In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And for these bitter tears, which now you see</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Be pitiful to my condemned sons,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>For two and twenty sons I never wept,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Because they died in honour's lofty bed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Lieth down; the Judges,  &amp;c., pass by him, and Exeunt</em></p>
<span id='12'>For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write</span><br/>
<span id='13'>My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>That shall distil from these two ancient urns,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Than youthful April shall with all his showers:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LUCIUS, with his sword drawn</em></p>
<span id='23'>O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men!</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And let me say, that never wept before,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>My tears are now prevailing orators.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>O noble father, you lament in vain:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And you recount your sorrows to a stone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Why, tis no matter, man; if they did hear,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>They would not mark me, or if they did mark,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>They would not pity me, yet plead I must;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Who, though they cannot answer my distress,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>For that they will not intercept my tale:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>When I do weep, they humbly at my feet</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And, were they but attired in grave weeds,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Rome could afford no tribune like to these.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>A stone is soft as wax,&mdash;tribunes more hard than stones;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>A stone is silent, and offendeth not,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.</span><br/>
<p><em>Rises</em></p>
<span id='47'>But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>To rescue my two brothers from their death:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>For which attempt the judges have pronounced</span><br/>
<span id='50'>My everlasting doom of banishment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>O happy man! they have befriended thee.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive</span><br/>
<span id='53'>That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey</span><br/>
<span id='55'>But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>From these devourers to be banished!</span><br/>
<span id='57'>But who comes with our brother Marcus here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MARCUS and LAVINIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Will it consume me? let me see it, then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>This was thy daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Why, Marcus, so she is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Ay me, this object kills me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?</span><br/>
<span id='68'>What fool hath added water to the sea,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?</span><br/>
<span id='70'>My grief was at the height before thou camest,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>In bootless prayer have they been held up,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And they have served me to effectless use:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Now all the service I require of them</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Is that the one will help to cut the other.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>O, that delightful engine of her thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='83'>That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>O, thus I found her, straying in the park,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer</span><br/>
<span id='90'>That hath received some unrecuring wound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>It was my deer; and he that wounded her</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>For now I stand as one upon a rock</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Environed with a wilderness of sea,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Expecting ever when some envious surge</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>This way to death my wretched sons are gone;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Here stands my other son, a banished man,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And here my brother, weeping at my woes.</span><br/>
<span id='101'>But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>It would have madded me: what shall I do</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Now I behold thy lively body so?</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Thy husband he is dead: and for his death</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!</span><br/>
<span id='111'>When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Perchance because she knows them innocent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks</span><br/>
<span id='125'>How they are stain'd, as meadows, yet not dry,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>With miry slime left on them by a flood?</span><br/>
<span id='127'>And in the fountain shall we gaze so long</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Pass the remainder of our hateful days?</span><br/>
<span id='133'>What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Plot some deuce of further misery,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>To make us wonder'd at in time to come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your grief,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Ah, Marcus, Marcus! brother, well I wot</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say</span><br/>
<span id='145'>That to her brother which I said to thee:</span><br/>
<span id='146'>His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.</span><br/>
<span id='148'>O, what a sympathy of woe is this,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter AARON</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Sends thee this word,&mdash;that, if thou love thy sons,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Or any one of you, chop off your hand,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>And send it to the king: he for the same</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Will send thee hither both thy sons alive;</span><br/>
<span id='156'>And that shall be the ransom for their fault.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Did ever raven sing so like a lark,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?</span><br/>
<span id='160'>With all my heart, I'll send the emperor my hand:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>That hath thrown down so many enemies,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:</span><br/>
<span id='165'>My youth can better spare my blood than you;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'> Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?</span><br/>
<span id='170'>O, none of both but are of high desert:</span><br/>
<span id='171'>My hand hath been but idle; let it serve</span><br/>
<span id='172'>To ransom my two nephews from their death;</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Then have I kept it to a worthy end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>For fear they die before their pardon come.</span><br/>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>My hand shall go.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='178'>Sirs, strive no more: such wither'd herbs as these</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.</span><br/>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Let me redeem my brothers both from death.</span><br/>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>And, for our father's sake and mother's care,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Now let me show a brother's love to thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>Agree between you; I will spare my hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>Then I'll go fetch an axe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>But I will use the axe.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS</em></p>

<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Come hither, Aaron; I'll deceive them both:</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>[Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>And never, whilst I live, deceive men so:</span><br/>
<span id='191'>But I'll deceive you in another sort,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>And that you'll say, ere half an hour pass.</span><br/>
<p><em>Cuts off TITUS's hand</em></p>

<span id='197'>More hath it merited; that let it have.</span><br/>
<span id='198'>As for my sons, say I account of them</span><br/>
<span id='199'>As jewels purchased at an easy price;</span><br/>

<span id='205'>Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.</span><br/>

<span id='speech47'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>If there were reason for these miseries,</span><br/>
<span id='222'>Then into limits could I bind my woes:</span><br/>
<span id='223'>When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?</span><br/>
<span id='224'>If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Threatening the welkin with his big-swoln face?</span><br/>
<span id='226'>And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?</span><br/>
<span id='227'>I am the sea; hark, how her sighs do blow!</span><br/>
<span id='228'>She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:</span><br/>
<span id='229'>Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;</span><br/>
<span id='230'>Then must my earth with her continual tears</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;</span><br/>
<span id='232'>For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,</span><br/>
<span id='233'>But like a drunkard must I vomit them.</span><br/>

<span id='261'>Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs:</span><br/>
<span id='262'>Rend off thy silver hair, thy other hand</span><br/>
<span id='263'>Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight</span><br/>
<span id='264'>The closing up of our most wretched eyes;</span><br/>
<span id='265'>Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?</span><br/>

<span id='268'>Why, I have not another tear to shed:</span><br/>
<span id='269'>Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,</span><br/>
<span id='270'>And would usurp upon my watery eyes</span><br/>
<span id='271'>And make them blind with tributary tears:</span><br/>
<span id='272'>Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?</span><br/>
<span id='273'>For these two heads do seem to speak to me,</span><br/>
<span id='274'>And threat me I shall never come to bliss</span><br/>
<span id='275'>Till all these mischiefs be return'd again</span><br/>
<span id='276'>Even in their throats that have committed them.</span><br/>
<span id='277'>Come, let me see what task I have to do.</span><br/>
<span id='278'>You heavy people, circle me about,</span><br/>
<span id='279'>That I may turn me to each one of you,</span><br/>
<span id='280'>And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.</span><br/>
<span id='281'>The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head;</span><br/>
<span id='282'>And in this hand the other I will bear.</span><br/>
<span id='283'>Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd: these arms!</span><br/>
<span id='284'>Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.</span><br/>
<span id='285'>As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight;</span><br/>
<span id='286'>Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay:</span><br/>
<span id='287'>Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there:</span><br/>
<span id='288'>And, if you love me, as I think you do,</span><br/>
<span id='289'>Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.</span><br/>

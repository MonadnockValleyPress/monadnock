<h3>Act III, Prologue</h3>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Chorus</em>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Chorus</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies</span><br/>
<span id='2'>In motion of no less celerity</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen</span><br/>
<span id='4'>The well-appointed king at Hampton pier</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet</span><br/>
<span id='6'>With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Play with your fancies, and in them behold</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think</span><br/>
<span id='14'>You stand upon the ravage and behold</span><br/>
<span id='15'>A city on the inconstant billows dancing;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>For so appears this fleet majestical,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And leave your England, as dead midnight still,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd</span><br/>
<span id='23'>With one appearing hair, that will not follow</span><br/>
<span id='24'>These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Behold the ordnance on their carriages,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Tells Harry that the king doth offer him</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner</span><br/>
<span id='33'>With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,</span><br/>
<p><em>Alarum, and chambers go off</em></p>
<span id='34'>And down goes all before them. Still be kind,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And eke out our performance with your mind.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<h1>Measure for Measure</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>A hall in Angelo's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ANGELO, ESCALUS, and a Justice, Provost, Officers, and other Attendants, behind</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>We must not make a scarecrow of the law,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And let it keep one shape, till custom make it</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Their perch and not their terror.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Ay, but yet</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Whom I would save, had a most noble father!</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Let but your honour know,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>That, in the working of your own affections,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Or that the resolute acting of your blood</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Whether you had not sometime in your life</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Err'd in this point which now you censure him,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And pull'd the law upon you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Another thing to fall. I not deny,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>That justice seizes: what know the laws</span><br/>
<span id='24'>That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Because we see it; but what we do not see</span><br/>
<span id='27'>We tread upon, and never think of it.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>You may not so extenuate his offence</span><br/>
<span id='29'>For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>When I, that censure him, do so offend,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Be it as your wisdom will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Where is the provost?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Here, if it like your honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>See that Claudio</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Provost</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>[Aside]  Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And some condemned for a fault alone.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ELBOW, and Officers with FROTH and POMPEY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Come, bring them away: if these be good people in</span><br/>
<span id='45'>a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in</span><br/>
<span id='46'>common houses, I know no law: bring them away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>If it please your honour, I am the poor duke's</span><br/>
<span id='49'>constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon</span><br/>
<span id='50'>justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good</span><br/>
<span id='51'>honour two notorious benefactors.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are</span><br/>
<span id='53'>they not malefactors?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>If it please your honour, I know not well what they</span><br/>
<span id='55'>are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure</span><br/>
<span id='56'>of; and void of all profanation in the world that</span><br/>
<span id='57'>good Christians ought to have.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>This comes off well; here's a wise officer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your</span><br/>
<span id='60'>name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>What are you, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that</span><br/>
<span id='64'>serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they</span><br/>
<span id='65'>say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she</span><br/>
<span id='66'>professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>How know you that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>How? thy wife?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Dost thou detest her therefore?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as</span><br/>
<span id='73'>she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>How dost thou know that, constable?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman</span><br/>
<span id='77'>cardinally given, might have been accused in</span><br/>
<span id='78'>fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>By the woman's means?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she</span><br/>
<span id='81'>spit in his face, so she defied him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable</span><br/>
<span id='84'>man; prove it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Do you hear how he misplaces?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very</span><br/>
<span id='89'>distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a</span><br/>
<span id='90'>dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen</span><br/>
<span id='91'>such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very</span><br/>
<span id='92'>good dishes,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in</span><br/>
<span id='95'>the right: but to the point. As I say, this</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and</span><br/>
<span id='97'>being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for</span><br/>
<span id='98'>prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the</span><br/>
<span id='100'>rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very</span><br/>
<span id='101'>honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could</span><br/>
<span id='102'>not give you three-pence again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>FROTH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>No, indeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>FROTH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Ay, so I did indeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be</span><br/>
<span id='108'>remembered, that such a one and such a one were past</span><br/>
<span id='109'>cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very</span><br/>
<span id='110'>good diet, as I told you,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>FROTH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>All this is true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Why, very well, then,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What</span><br/>
<span id='114'>was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to</span><br/>
<span id='115'>complain of? Come me to what was done to her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>No, sir, nor I mean it not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's</span><br/>
<span id='119'>leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth</span><br/>
<span id='120'>here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose</span><br/>
<span id='121'>father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Master Froth?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>FROTH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>All-hallond eve.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in</span><br/>
<span id='126'>the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight</span><br/>
<span id='127'>to sit, have you not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>FROTH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>This will last out a night in Russia,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.</span><br/>
<span id='132'>And leave you to the hearing of the cause;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit ANGELO</em></p>
<span id='135'>Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>I beseech your honour, ask me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a</span><br/>
<span id='142'>good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Ay, sir, very well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Well, I do so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Doth your honour see any harm in his face?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Why, no.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst</span><br/>
<span id='149'>thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the</span><br/>
<span id='150'>worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the</span><br/>
<span id='151'>constable's wife any harm? I would know that of</span><br/>
<span id='152'>your honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>First, an it like you, the house is a respected</span><br/>
<span id='155'>house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his</span><br/>
<span id='156'>mistress is a respected woman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>

<span id='157'>By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected</span><br/>

<span id='160'>time has yet to come that she was ever respected</span><br/>
<span id='161'>with man, woman, or child.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>

<span id='163'>Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is</span><br/>
<span id='164'>this true?</span><br/>

<span id='speech68'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married</span><br/>
<span id='167'>to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she</span><br/>
<span id='168'>with me, let not your worship think me the poor</span><br/>
<span id='169'>duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or</span><br/>
<span id='170'>I'll have mine action of battery on thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your</span><br/>

<span id='speech71'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>

<span id='175'>Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him</span><br/>
<span id='176'>that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him</span><br/>

<span id='speech91'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>

<span id='214'>If the law would allow it, sir.</span><br/>

<span id='speech93'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>

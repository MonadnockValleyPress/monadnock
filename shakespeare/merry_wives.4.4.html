<h1>The Merry Wives of Windsor</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>A room in Ford's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and SIR HUGH EVANS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SIR HUGH EVANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>'Tis one of the best discretions of a 'oman as ever</span><br/>
<span id='2'>I did look upon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>And did he send you both these letters at an instant?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Within a quarter of an hour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>I rather will suspect the sun with cold</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Than thee with wantonness: now doth thy honour stand</span><br/>
<span id='8'>In him that was of late an heretic,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>As firm as faith.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>'Tis well, 'tis well; no more:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Be not as extreme in submission</span><br/>
<span id='12'>As in offence.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>But let our plot go forward: let our wives</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Yet once again, to make us public sport,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>There is no better way than that they spoke of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>How? to send him word they'll meet him in the park</span><br/>
<span id='19'>at midnight? Fie, fie! he'll never come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SIR HUGH EVANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has</span><br/>
<span id='21'>been grievously peaten as an old 'oman: methinks</span><br/>
<span id='22'>there should be terrors in him that he should not</span><br/>
<span id='23'>come; methinks his flesh is punished, he shall have</span><br/>
<span id='24'>no desires.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>So think I too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And let us two devise to bring him thither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain</span><br/>
<span id='34'>In a most hideous and dreadful manner:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know</span><br/>
<span id='36'>The superstitious idle-headed eld</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Received and did deliver to our age</span><br/>
<span id='38'>This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Why, yet there want not many that do fear</span><br/>
<span id='40'>In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>But what of this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>                  Marry, this is our device;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And in this shape when you have brought him thither,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>What shall be done with him? what is your plot?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Nan Page my daughter and my little son</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And three or four more of their growth we'll dress</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once</span><br/>
<span id='55'>With some diffused song: upon their sight,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>We two in great amazedness will fly:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Then let them all encircle him about</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>In their so sacred paths he dares to tread</span><br/>
<span id='61'>In shape profane.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>                  And till he tell the truth,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And burn him with their tapers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>The truth being known,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>We'll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And mock him home to Windsor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>The children must</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Be practised well to this, or they'll ne'er do't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SIR HUGH EVANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>I will teach the children their behaviors; and I</span><br/>
<span id='71'>will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the</span><br/>
<span id='72'>knight with my taber.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>That will be excellent. I'll go and buy them vizards.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Finely attired in a robe of white.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>That silk will I go buy.</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='77'>And in that time</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away</span><br/>
<span id='79'>And marry her at Eton. Go send to Falstaff straight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook</span><br/>
<span id='81'>He'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Fear not you that. Go get us properties</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And tricking for our fairies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>SIR HUGH EVANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Let us about it: it is admirable pleasures and fery</span><br/>
<span id='85'>honest knaveries.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt PAGE, FORD, and SIR HUGH EVANS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Go, Mistress Ford,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit MISTRESS FORD</em></p>
<span id='88'>I'll to the doctor: he hath my good will,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And he my husband best of all affects.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>The doctor is well money'd, and his friends</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

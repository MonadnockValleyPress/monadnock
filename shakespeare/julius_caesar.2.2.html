<h1>Julius Caesar</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Caesar's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Thunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR, in his night-gown</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Servant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>My lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Go bid the priests do present sacrifice</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And bring me their opinions of success.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>I will, my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter CALPURNIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CALPURNIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?</span><br/>
<span id='9'>You shall not stir out of your house to-day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The face of Caesar, they are vanished.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CALPURNIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Yet now they fright me. There is one within,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Besides the things that we have heard and seen,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>A lioness hath whelped in the streets;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>The noise of battle hurtled in the air,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And I do fear them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>What can be avoided</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Are to the world in general as to Caesar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CALPURNIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>When beggars die, there are no comets seen;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Cowards die many times before their deaths;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>The valiant never taste of death but once.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>It seems to me most strange that men should fear;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Seeing that death, a necessary end,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Will come when it will come.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Servant</em></p>
<span id='39'>What say the augurers?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>They would not have you to stir forth to-day.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>They could not find a heart within the beast.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>The gods do this in shame of cowardice:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Caesar should be a beast without a heart,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>If he should stay at home to-day for fear.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well</span><br/>
<span id='47'>That Caesar is more dangerous than he:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>We are two lions litter'd in one day,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And I the elder and more terrible:</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And Caesar shall go forth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CALPURNIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Alas, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear</span><br/>
<span id='54'>That keeps you in the house, and not your own.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And he shall say you are not well to-day:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Mark Antony shall say I am not well,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DECIUS BRUTUS</em></p>
<span id='60'>Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DECIUS BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>I come to fetch you to the senate-house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>And you are come in very happy time,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>To bear my greeting to the senators</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And tell them that I will not come to-day:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CALPURNIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Say he is sick.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>                  Shall Caesar send a lie?</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DECIUS BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>The cause is in my will: I will not come;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>That is enough to satisfy the senate.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>But for your private satisfaction,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Because I love you, I will let you know:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And evils imminent; and on her knee</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DECIUS BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>This dream is all amiss interpreted;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>It was a vision fair and fortunate:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>In which so many smiling Romans bathed,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Reviving blood, and that great men shall press</span><br/>
<span id='93'>For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>And this way have you well expounded it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DECIUS BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>I have, when you have heard what I can say:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And know it now: the senate have concluded</span><br/>
<span id='98'>To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>If you shall send them word you will not come,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Apt to be render'd, for some one to say</span><br/>
<span id='102'>'Break up the senate till another time,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'</span><br/>
<span id='104'>If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper</span><br/>
<span id='105'>'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love</span><br/>
<span id='107'>To our proceeding bids me tell you this;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And reason to my love is liable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!</span><br/>
<span id='110'>I am ashamed I did yield to them.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Give me my robe, for I will go.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA, TREBONIUS, and CINNA</em></p>
<span id='112'>And look where Publius is come to fetch me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PUBLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Good morrow, Caesar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Welcome, Publius.</span><br/>
<span id='115'>What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy</span><br/>
<span id='118'>As that same ague which hath made you lean.</span><br/>
<span id='119'>What is 't o'clock?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>I thank you for your pains and courtesy.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ANTONY</em></p>
<span id='122'>See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>So to most noble Caesar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Bid them prepare within:</span><br/>
<span id='126'>I am to blame to be thus waited for.</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!</span><br/>
<span id='128'>I have an hour's talk in store for you;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Remember that you call on me to-day:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Be near me, that I may remember you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>TREBONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Caesar, I will:</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='132'>and so near will I be,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>That your best friends shall wish I had been further.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And we, like friends, will straightway go together.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>[Aside]  That every like is not the same, O Caesar,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Love's Labours Lost</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>The same.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the PRINCESS, and her train, a Forester, BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Was that the king, that spurred his horse so hard</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Against the steep uprising of the hill?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>I know not; but I think it was not he.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Whoe'er a' was, a' show'd a mounting mind.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>On Saturday we will return to France.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush</span><br/>
<span id='8'>That we must stand and play the murderer in?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Forester</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Forester</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>What, what? first praise me and again say no?</span><br/>
<span id='15'>O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Forester</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Yes, madam, fair.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>                  Nay, never paint me now:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Fair payment for foul words is more than due.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Forester</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!</span><br/>
<span id='23'>O heresy in fair, fit for these days!</span><br/>
<span id='24'>A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And shooting well is then accounted ill.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>If wounding, then it was to show my skill,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And out of question so it is sometimes,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>We bend to that the working of the heart;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>As I for praise alone now seek to spill</span><br/>
<span id='36'>The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Only for praise sake, when they strive to be</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Lords o'er their lords?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Only for praise: and praise we may afford</span><br/>
<span id='41'>To any lady that subdues a lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Here comes a member of the commonwealth.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter COSTARD</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>COSTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>COSTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Which is the greatest lady, the highest?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>The thickest and the tallest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>COSTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>The thickest and the tallest! it is so; truth is truth.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Are not you the chief woman? you are the thickest here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>What's your will, sir? what's your will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>COSTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>O, thy letter, thy letter! he's a good friend of mine:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Break up this capon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>I am bound to serve.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>This letter is mistook, it importeth none here;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>It is writ to Jaquenetta.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>We will read it, I swear.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Break the neck of the wax, and every one give ear.</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that</span><br/>
<span id='63'>thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful</span><br/>
<span id='64'>than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have</span><br/>
<span id='65'>commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The</span><br/>
<span id='66'>magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set</span><br/>
<span id='67'>eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Veni, vidi, vici; which to annothanize in the</span><br/>
<span id='70'>vulgar,&mdash;O base and obscure vulgar!&mdash;videlicet, He</span><br/>
<span id='71'>came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he</span><br/>
<span id='73'>come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to</span><br/>
<span id='74'>whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the</span><br/>
<span id='75'>beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The</span><br/>
<span id='76'>conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>The captive is enriched: on whose side? the</span><br/>
<span id='78'>beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose</span><br/>
<span id='79'>side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in</span><br/>
<span id='80'>both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:</span><br/>
<span id='81'>thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce</span><br/>
<span id='83'>thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I</span><br/>
<span id='84'>will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every</span><br/>
<span id='88'>part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar</span><br/>
<span id='91'>'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Submissive fall his princely feet before,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And he from forage will incline to play:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Food for his rage, repasture for his den.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?</span><br/>
<span id='97'>What vane? what weathercock? did you ever hear better?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>I am much deceived but I remember the style.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport</span><br/>
<span id='102'>To the prince and his bookmates.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Thou fellow, a word:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Who gave thee this letter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>COSTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>I told you; my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>To whom shouldst thou give it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>COSTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>From my lord to my lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>From which lord to which lady?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>COSTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>From my lord Biron, a good master of mine,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>To a lady of France that he call'd Rosaline.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away.</span><br/>
<p><em>To ROSALINE</em></p>
<span id='112'>Here, sweet, put up this: 'twill be thine another day.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt PRINCESS and train</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Who is the suitor? who is the suitor?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Shall I teach you to know?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Ay, my continent of beauty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Why, she that bears the bow.</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Finely put off!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Finely put on!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Well, then, I am the shooter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>And who is your deer?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Finely put on, indeed!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MARIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes</span><br/>
<span id='126'>at the brow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>But she herself is hit lower: have I hit her now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was</span><br/>
<span id='129'>a man when King Pepin of France was a little boy, as</span><br/>
<span id='130'>touching the hit it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a</span><br/>
<span id='132'>woman when Queen Guinover of Britain was a little</span><br/>
<span id='133'>wench, as touching the hit it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>          Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Thou canst not hit it, my good man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>          An I cannot, cannot, cannot,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>An I cannot, another can.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ROSALINE and KATHARINE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>COSTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>By my troth, most pleasant: how both did fit it!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>MARIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>A mark marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>MARIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Wide o' the bow hand! i' faith, your hand is out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>COSTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Indeed, a' must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the clout.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>COSTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>MARIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>COSTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>She's too hard for you at pricks, sir: challenge her to bowl.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>I fear too much rubbing. Good night, my good owl.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt BOYET and MARIA</em></p>

<span id='speech61'><strong>COSTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>By my soul, a swain! a most simple clown!</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!</span><br/>
<span id='151'>O' my troth, most sweet jests! most incony</span><br/>
<span id='152'>vulgar wit!</span><br/>
<span id='153'>When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it</span><br/>
<span id='154'>were, so fit.</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Armado o' th' one side,&mdash;O, a most dainty man!</span><br/>
<span id='156'>To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!</span><br/>
<span id='157'>To see him kiss his hand! and how most sweetly a'</span><br/>
<span id='158'>will swear!</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And his page o' t' other side, that handful of wit!</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Ah, heavens, it is a most pathetical nit!</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Sola, sola!</span><br/>

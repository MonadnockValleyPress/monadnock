<h1>Macbeth</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene VI</h3>
<h4>Forres. The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LENNOX and another Lord</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LENNOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Which can interpret further: only, I say,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Things have been strangely borne. The</span><br/>
<span id='4'>gracious Duncan</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Who cannot want the thought how monstrous</span><br/>
<span id='10'>It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To kill their gracious father? damned fact!</span><br/>
<span id='12'>How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight</span><br/>
<span id='13'>In pious rage the two delinquents tear,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive</span><br/>
<span id='17'>To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>He has borne all things well: and I do think</span><br/>
<span id='19'>That had he Duncan's sons under his key&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>As, an't please heaven, he shall not&mdash;they</span><br/>
<span id='21'>should find</span><br/>
<span id='22'>What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd</span><br/>
<span id='24'>His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Where he bestows himself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>The son of Duncan,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Lives in the English court, and is received</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Of the most pious Edward with such grace</span><br/>
<span id='31'>That the malevolence of fortune nothing</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid</span><br/>
<span id='34'>To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>That, by the help of these&mdash;with Him above</span><br/>
<span id='36'>To ratify the work&mdash;we may again</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Do faithful homage and receive free honours:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>All which we pine for now: and this report</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Hath so exasperate the king that he</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Prepares for some attempt of war.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LENNOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Sent he to Macduff?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'</span><br/>
<span id='45'>The cloudy messenger turns me his back,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time</span><br/>
<span id='47'>That clogs me with this answer.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LENNOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>And that well might</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance</span><br/>
<span id='50'>His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Fly to the court of England and unfold</span><br/>
<span id='52'>His message ere he come, that a swift blessing</span><br/>
<span id='53'>May soon return to this our suffering country</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Under a hand accursed!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>I'll send my prayers with him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

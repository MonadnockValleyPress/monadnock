<blockquote>
<em>Enter LORENZO and JESSICA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And they did make no noise, in such a night</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Where Cressid lay that night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>JESSICA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>In such a night</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And saw the lion's shadow ere himself</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And ran dismay'd away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>In such a night</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Stood Dido with a willow in her hand</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love</span><br/>
<span id='14'>To come again to Carthage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>JESSICA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>In such a night</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs</span><br/>
<span id='17'>That did renew old AEson.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>In such a night</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And with an unthrift love did run from Venice</span><br/>
<span id='21'>As far as Belmont.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>JESSICA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>                  In such a night</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Stealing her soul with many vows of faith</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And ne'er a true one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>In such a night</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Slander her love, and he forgave it her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>JESSICA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>I would out-night you, did no body come;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter STEPHANO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Who comes so fast in silence of the night?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>STEPHANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>A friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>STEPHANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Stephano is my name; and I bring word</span><br/>
<span id='35'>My mistress will before the break of day</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about</span><br/>
<span id='37'>By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays</span><br/>
<span id='38'>For happy wedlock hours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Who comes with her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>STEPHANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>None but a holy hermit and her maid.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>I pray you, is my master yet return'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>He is not, nor we have not heard from him.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And ceremoniously let us prepare</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Some welcome for the mistress of the house.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LAUNCELOT</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Who calls?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Leave hollaing, man: here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Sola! where? where?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LAUNCELOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Tell him there's a post come from my master, with</span><br/>
<span id='54'>his horn full of good news: my master will be here</span><br/>
<span id='55'>ere morning.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And yet no matter: why should we go in?</span><br/>
<span id='58'>My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Within the house, your mistress is at hand;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And bring your music forth into the air.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Stephano</em></p>
<span id='61'>How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Here will we sit and let the sounds of music</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Become the touches of sweet harmony.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st</span><br/>
<span id='68'>But in his motion like an angel sings,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Such harmony is in immortal souls;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>But whilst this muddy vesture of decay</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Musicians</em></p>
<span id='73'>Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!</span><br/>
<span id='74'>With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And draw her home with music.</span><br/>
<p><em>Music</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>JESSICA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>I am never merry when I hear sweet music.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>The reason is, your spirits are attentive:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>For do but note a wild and wanton herd,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Which is the hot condition of their blood;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Or any air of music touch their ears,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze</span><br/>
<span id='86'>By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>But music for the time doth change his nature.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>The man that hath no music in himself,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>The motions of his spirit are dull as night</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And his affections dark as Erebus:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PORTIA and NERISSA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>That light we see is burning in my hall.</span><br/>
<span id='97'>How far that little candle throws his beams!</span><br/>
<span id='98'>So shines a good deed in a naughty world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>NERISSA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>So doth the greater glory dim the less:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>A substitute shines brightly as a king</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Unto the king be by, and then his state</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Empties itself, as doth an inland brook</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Into the main of waters. Music! hark!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>NERISSA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>It is your music, madam, of the house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Nothing is good, I see, without respect:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>NERISSA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>When neither is attended, and I think</span><br/>
<span id='111'>The nightingale, if she should sing by day,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>When every goose is cackling, would be thought</span><br/>
<span id='113'>No better a musician than the wren.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>How many things by season season'd are</span><br/>
<span id='115'>To their right praise and true perfection!</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And would not be awaked.</span><br/>
<p><em>Music ceases</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>That is the voice,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Or I am much deceived, of Portia.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>By the bad voice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>                  Dear lady, welcome home.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>We have been praying for our husbands' healths,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Are they return'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>                  Madam, they are not yet;</span><br/>
<span id='127'>But there is come a messenger before,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>To signify their coming.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Go in, Nerissa;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Give order to my servants that they take</span><br/>
<span id='131'>No note at all of our being absent hence;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.</span><br/>
<p><em>A tucket sounds</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>This night methinks is but the daylight sick;</span><br/>
<span id='136'>It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Such as the day is when the sun is hid.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and their followers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>We should hold day with the Antipodes,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>If you would walk in absence of the sun.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Let me give light, but let me not be light;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>And never be Bassanio so for me:</span><br/>
<span id='143'>But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.</span><br/>
<span id='145'>This is the man, this is Antonio,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>To whom I am so infinitely bound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>You should in all sense be much bound to him.</span><br/>
<span id='148'>For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>No more than I am well acquitted of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Sir, you are very welcome to our house:</span><br/>
<span id='151'>It must appear in other ways than words,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>[To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;</span><br/>
<span id='154'>In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring</span><br/>
<span id='159'>That she did give me, whose posy was</span><br/>
<span id='160'>For all the world like cutler's poetry</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Upon  a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>NERISSA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>What talk you of the posy or the value?</span><br/>
<span id='163'>You swore to me, when I did give it you,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>That you would wear it till your hour of death</span><br/>
<span id='165'>And that it should lie with you in your grave:</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>You should have been respective and have kept it.</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>He will, an if he live to be a man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>NERISSA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Ay, if a woman live to be a man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:</span><br/>
<span id='176'>I could not for my heart deny it him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>You were to blame, I must be plain with you,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:</span><br/>
<span id='179'>A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger</span><br/>
<span id='180'>And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.</span><br/>
<span id='181'>I gave my love a ring and made him swear</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Never to part with it; and here he stands;</span><br/>
<span id='183'>I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth</span><br/>
<span id='185'>That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:</span><br/>
<span id='187'>An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>[Aside]  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off</span><br/>
<span id='189'>And swear I lost the ring defending it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;</span><br/>
<span id='194'>And neither man nor master would take aught</span><br/>
<span id='195'>But the two rings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>What ring gave you my lord?</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Not that, I hope, which you received of me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>If I could add a lie unto a fault,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>I would deny it; but you see my finger</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>Even so void is your false heart of truth.</span><br/>
<span id='202'>By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Until I see the ring.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>NERISSA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>Nor I in yours</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Till I again see mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>Sweet Portia,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>If you did know to whom I gave the ring,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>If you did know for whom I gave the ring</span><br/>
<span id='209'>And would conceive for what I gave the ring</span><br/>
<span id='210'>And how unwillingly I left the ring,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>When nought would be accepted but the ring,</span><br/>
<span id='212'>You would abate the strength of your displeasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='213'>If you had known the virtue of the ring,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Or your own honour to contain the ring,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>You would not then have parted with the ring.</span><br/>
<span id='217'>What man is there so much unreasonable,</span><br/>
<span id='218'>If you had pleased to have defended it</span><br/>
<span id='219'>With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty</span><br/>
<span id='220'>To urge the thing held as a ceremony?</span><br/>
<span id='221'>Nerissa teaches me what to believe:</span><br/>
<span id='222'>I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='223'>No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,</span><br/>
<span id='224'>No woman had it, but a civil doctor,</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me</span><br/>
<span id='226'>And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him</span><br/>
<span id='227'>And suffer'd him to go displeased away;</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Even he that did uphold the very life</span><br/>
<span id='229'>Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?</span><br/>
<span id='230'>I was enforced to send it after him;</span><br/>
<span id='231'>I was beset with shame and courtesy;</span><br/>
<span id='232'>My honour would not let ingratitude</span><br/>
<span id='233'>So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;</span><br/>
<span id='234'>For, by these blessed candles of the night,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd</span><br/>
<span id='236'>The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='237'>Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:</span><br/>
<span id='238'>Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,</span><br/>
<span id='239'>And that which you did swear to keep for me,</span><br/>
<span id='240'>I will become as liberal as you;</span><br/>
<span id='241'>I'll not deny him any thing I have,</span><br/>
<span id='242'>No, not my body nor my husband's bed:</span><br/>
<span id='243'>Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:</span><br/>
<span id='244'>Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:</span><br/>
<span id='245'>If you do not, if I be left alone,</span><br/>
<span id='246'>Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,</span><br/>
<span id='247'>I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>NERISSA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='248'>And I his clerk; therefore be well advised</span><br/>
<span id='249'>How you do leave me to mine own protection.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='250'>Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;</span><br/>
<span id='251'>For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='254'>Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;</span><br/>
<span id='255'>And, in the hearing of these many friends,</span><br/>
<span id='256'>I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='257'>Wherein I see myself&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='260'>In each eye, one: swear by your double self,</span><br/>
<span id='261'>And there's an oath of credit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='262'>Nay, but hear me:</span><br/>
<span id='263'>Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear</span><br/>
<span id='264'>I never more will break an oath with thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='265'>I once did lend my body for his wealth;</span><br/>
<span id='266'>Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,</span><br/>
<span id='267'>Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,</span><br/>
<span id='268'>My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord</span><br/>
<span id='269'>Will never more break faith advisedly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='270'>Then you shall be his surety. Give him this</span><br/>
<span id='271'>And bid him keep it better than the other.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='272'>Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='273'>By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='274'>I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;</span><br/>
<span id='275'>For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>NERISSA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='276'>And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;</span><br/>
<span id='277'>For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,</span><br/>
<span id='278'>In lieu of this last night did lie with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='279'>Why, this is like the mending of highways</span><br/>
<span id='280'>In summer, where the ways are fair enough:</span><br/>
<span id='281'>What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='282'>Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:</span><br/>
<span id='283'>Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;</span><br/>
<span id='284'>It comes from Padua, from Bellario:</span><br/>
<span id='285'>There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,</span><br/>
<span id='286'>Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here</span><br/>
<span id='287'>Shall witness I set forth as soon as you</span><br/>
<span id='288'>And even but now return'd; I have not yet</span><br/>
<span id='289'>Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;</span><br/>
<span id='290'>And I have better news in store for you</span><br/>
<span id='291'>Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;</span><br/>
<span id='292'>There you shall find three of your argosies</span><br/>
<span id='293'>Are richly come to harbour suddenly:</span><br/>
<span id='294'>You shall not know by what strange accident</span><br/>
<span id='295'>I chanced on this letter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='296'>I am dumb.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='297'>Were you the doctor and I knew you not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='298'>Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>NERISSA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='299'>Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,</span><br/>
<span id='300'>Unless he live until he be a man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='301'>Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:</span><br/>
<span id='302'>When I am absent, then lie with my wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='303'>Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;</span><br/>
<span id='304'>For here I read for certain that my ships</span><br/>
<span id='305'>Are safely come to road.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='306'>How now, Lorenzo!</span><br/>
<span id='307'>My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>NERISSA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='308'>Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.</span><br/>
<span id='309'>There do I give to you and Jessica,</span><br/>
<span id='310'>From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,</span><br/>
<span id='311'>After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='312'>Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way</span><br/>
<span id='313'>Of starved people.</span><br/>

<span id='speech89'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='314'>                  It is almost morning,</span><br/>
<span id='315'>And yet I am sure you are not satisfied</span><br/>
<span id='316'>Of these events at full. Let us go in;</span><br/>
<span id='317'>And charge us there upon inter'gatories,</span><br/>
<span id='318'>And we will answer all things faithfully.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech90'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='319'>Let it be so: the first inter'gatory</span><br/>
<span id='320'>That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,</span><br/>
<span id='321'>Whether till the next night she had rather stay,</span><br/>
<span id='322'>Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:</span><br/>
<span id='323'>But were the day come, I should wish it dark,</span><br/>
<span id='324'>That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.</span><br/>
<span id='325'>Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing</span><br/>
<span id='326'>So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.</span><br/>

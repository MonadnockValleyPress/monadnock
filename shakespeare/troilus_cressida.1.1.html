<h1>Troilus and Cressida</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</H3>
<h4>Troy. Before Priam's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Why should I war without the walls of Troy,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>That find such cruel battle here within?</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Each Trojan that is master of his heart,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Will this gear ne'er be mended?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>But I am weaker than a woman's tear,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Less valiant than the virgin in the night</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And skilless as unpractised infancy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will</span><br/>
<span id='15'>have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Have I not tarried?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry</span><br/>
<span id='18'>the bolting.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Have I not tarried?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Still have I tarried.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word</span><br/>
<span id='23'>'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the</span><br/>
<span id='24'>heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must</span><br/>
<span id='25'>stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>At Priam's royal table do I sit;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw</span><br/>
<span id='32'>her look, or any woman else.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>I was about to tell thee:&mdash;when my heart,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>well, go to&mdash;there were no more comparison between</span><br/>
<span id='42'>the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I</span><br/>
<span id='43'>would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would</span><br/>
<span id='44'>somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I</span><br/>
<span id='45'>will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Reply not in how many fathoms deep</span><br/>
<span id='49'>They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad</span><br/>
<span id='50'>In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>In whose comparison all whites are ink,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure</span><br/>
<span id='56'>The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me</span><br/>
<span id='61'>The knife that made it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I speak no more than truth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Thou dost not speak so much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be</span><br/>
<span id='66'>not, she has the mends in her own hands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of</span><br/>
<span id='69'>her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and</span><br/>
<span id='70'>between, but small thanks for my labour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair</span><br/>
<span id='73'>as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as</span><br/>
<span id='74'>fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care</span><br/>
<span id='75'>I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Say I she is not fair?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to</span><br/>
<span id='78'>stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so</span><br/>
<span id='79'>I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Pandarus,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Not I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Sweet Pandarus,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I</span><br/>
<span id='85'>found it, and there an end.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit PANDARUS. An alarum</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>When with your blood you daily paint her thus.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>I cannot fight upon this argument;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>It is too starved a subject for my sword.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>But Pandarus,&mdash;O gods, how do you plague me!</span><br/>
<span id='92'>I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Between our Ilium and where she resides,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.</span><br/>
<p><em>Alarum. Enter AENEAS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>AENEAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>For womanish it is to be from thence.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>AENEAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>That Paris is returned home and hurt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>By whom, AEneas?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>AENEAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>                  Troilus, by Menelaus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.</span><br/>
<p><em>Alarum</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>AENEAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'</span><br/>
<span id='113'>But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>AENEAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>In all swift haste.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Come, go we then together.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

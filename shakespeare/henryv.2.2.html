<h1>Henry V</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Southampton. A council-chamber.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter EXETER, BEDFORD, and WESTMORELAND</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>'Fore God, his grace is bold, to trust these traitors.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>They shall be apprehended by and by.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>How smooth and even they do bear themselves!</span><br/>
<span id='4'>As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Crowned with faith and constant loyalty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>The king hath note of all that they intend,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>By interception which they dream not of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell</span><br/>
<span id='11'>His sovereign's life to death and treachery.</span><br/>
<p><em>Trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY V, SCROOP, CAMBRIDGE, GREY, and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Think you not that the powers we bear with us</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Will cut their passage through the force of France,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Doing the execution and the act</span><br/>
<span id='18'>For which we have in head assembled them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SCROOP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>I doubt not that; since we are well persuaded</span><br/>
<span id='21'>We carry not a heart with us from hence</span><br/>
<span id='22'>That grows not in a fair consent with ours,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Success and conquest to attend on us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CAMBRIDGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Never was monarch better fear'd and loved</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Than is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subject</span><br/>
<span id='27'>That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Under the sweet shade of your government.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>True: those that were your father's enemies</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you</span><br/>
<span id='31'>With hearts create of duty and of zeal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And shall forget the office of our hand,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Sooner than quittance of desert and merit</span><br/>
<span id='35'>According to the weight and worthiness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SCROOP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>So service shall with steeled sinews toil,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And labour shall refresh itself with hope,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>To do your grace incessant services.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Enlarge the man committed yesterday,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>That rail'd against our person: we consider</span><br/>
<span id='42'>It was excess of wine that set him on;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And on his more advice we pardon him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SCROOP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>That's mercy, but too much security:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>O, let us yet be merciful.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CAMBRIDGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>So may your highness, and yet punish too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Sir,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>You show great mercy, if you give him life,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>After the taste of much correction.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Alas, your too much love and care of me</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!</span><br/>
<span id='54'>If little faults, proceeding on distemper,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye</span><br/>
<span id='56'>When capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd and digested,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear care</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And tender preservation of our person,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Would have him punished. And now to our French causes:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Who are the late commissioners?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CAMBRIDGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I one, my lord:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SCROOP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>So did you me, my liege.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>And I, my royal sovereign.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Read them; and know, I know your worthiness.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>We will aboard to night. Why, how now, gentlemen!</span><br/>
<span id='72'>What see you in those papers that you lose</span><br/>
<span id='73'>So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there</span><br/>
<span id='75'>That hath so cowarded and chased your blood</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Out of appearance?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CAMBRIDGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>                  I do confess my fault;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And do submit me to your highness' mercy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>GREY</strong></span>

<span id='speech25'><strong>SCROOP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>To which we all appeal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>The mercy that was quick in us but late,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>See you, my princes, and my noble peers,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>You know how apt our love was to accord</span><br/>
<span id='88'>To furnish him with all appertinents</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Belonging to his honour; and this man</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And sworn unto the practises of France,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>To kill us here in Hampton: to the which</span><br/>
<span id='93'>This knight, no less for bounty bound to us</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>May it be possible, that foreign hire</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Could out of thee extract one spark of evil</span><br/>
<span id='103'>That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>That, though the truth of it stands off as gross</span><br/>
<span id='105'>As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Treason and murder ever kept together,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Working so grossly in a natural cause,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>That admiration did not whoop at them:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And whatsoever cunning fiend it was</span><br/>
<span id='113'>That wrought upon thee so preposterously</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:</span><br/>
<span id='115'>All other devils that suggest by treasons</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Do botch and bungle up damnation</span><br/>
<span id='117'>With patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'd</span><br/>
<span id='118'>From glistering semblances of piety;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.</span><br/>
<span id='122'>If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>He might return to vasty Tartar back,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And tell the legions 'I can never win</span><br/>
<span id='126'>A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'</span><br/>
<span id='127'>O, how hast thou with jealousy infected</span><br/>
<span id='128'>The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Not working with the eye without the ear,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>And but in purged judgment trusting neither?</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:</span><br/>
<span id='139'>And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>To mark the full-fraught man and best indued</span><br/>
<span id='141'>With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;</span><br/>
<span id='142'>For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Another fall of man. Their faults are open:</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Arrest them to the answer of the law;</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And God acquit them of their practises!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>   I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Richard Earl of Cambridge.</span><br/>
<span id='148'>I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.</span><br/>
<span id='150'>I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>SCROOP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Our purposes God justly hath discover'd;</span><br/>
<span id='153'>And I repent my fault more than my death;</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Which I beseech your highness to forgive,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Although my body pay the price of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CAMBRIDGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>For me, the gold of France did not seduce;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Although I did admit it as a motive</span><br/>
<span id='158'>The sooner to effect what I intended:</span><br/>
<span id='159'>But God be thanked for prevention;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Beseeching God and you to pardon me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Never did faithful subject more rejoice</span><br/>
<span id='163'>At the discovery of most dangerous treason</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself.</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Prevented from a damned enterprise:</span><br/>
<span id='166'>My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.</span><br/>
<span id='168'>You have conspired against our royal person,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Received the golden earnest of our death;</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>His princes and his peers to servitude,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>His subjects to oppression and contempt</span><br/>
<span id='174'>And his whole kingdom into desolation.</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Touching our person seek we no revenge;</span><br/>
<span id='176'>But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws</span><br/>
<span id='178'>We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Poor miserable wretches, to your death:</span><br/>
<span id='180'>The taste whereof, God of his mercy give</span><br/>
<span id='181'>You patience to endure, and true repentance</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt CAMBRIDGE, SCROOP and GREY, guarded</em></p>
<span id='183'>Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Shall be to you, as us, like glorious.</span><br/>
<span id='185'>We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Since God so graciously hath brought to light</span><br/>
<span id='187'>This dangerous treason lurking in our way</span><br/>
<span id='188'>To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now</span><br/>
<span id='189'>But every rub is smoothed on our way.</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Our puissance into the hand of God,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Putting it straight in expedition.</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:</span><br/>
<span id='194'>No king of England, if not king of France.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Henry VIII</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>The palace yard.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Noise and tumult within. Enter Porter and his Man</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Porter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>You'll leave your noise anon, ye rascals: do you</span><br/>
<span id='2'>take the court for Paris-garden? ye rude slaves,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>leave your gaping.</span><br/>
<p><em>Within</em></p>
<span id='4'>Good master porter, I belong to the larder.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Porter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Belong to the gallows, and be hanged, ye rogue! is</span><br/>
<span id='6'>this a place to roar in? Fetch me a dozen crab-tree</span><br/>
<span id='7'>staves, and strong ones: these are but switches to</span><br/>
<span id='8'>'em. I'll scratch your heads: you must be seeing</span><br/>
<span id='9'>christenings? do you look for ale and cakes here,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>you rude rascals?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Man</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Pray, sir, be patient: 'tis as much impossible&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Unless we sweep 'em from the door with cannons&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>To scatter 'em, as 'tis to make 'em sleep</span><br/>
<span id='14'>On May-day morning; which will never be:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>We may as well push against Powle's, as stir em.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Porter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>How got they in, and be hang'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Man</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Alas, I know not; how gets the tide in?</span><br/>
<span id='18'>As much as one sound cudgel of four foot&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>You see the poor remainder&mdash;could distribute,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>I made no spare, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Porter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>You did nothing, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Man</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To mow 'em down before me: but if I spared any</span><br/>
<span id='24'>That had a head to hit, either young or old,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Let me ne'er hope to see a chine again</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And that I would not for a cow, God save her!</span><br/>
<p><em>Within</em></p>
<span id='28'>Do you hear, master porter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Porter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>I shall be with you presently, good master puppy.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Keep the door close, sirrah.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Man</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>What would you have me do?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Porter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>What should you do, but knock 'em down by the</span><br/>
<span id='33'>dozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? or have</span><br/>
<span id='34'>we some strange Indian with the great tool come to</span><br/>
<span id='35'>court, the women so besiege us? Bless me, what a</span><br/>
<span id='36'>fry of fornication is at door! On my Christian</span><br/>
<span id='37'>conscience, this one christening will beget a</span><br/>
<span id='38'>thousand; here will be father, godfather, and all together.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Man</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>The spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is a</span><br/>
<span id='40'>fellow somewhat near the door, he should be a</span><br/>
<span id='41'>brazier by his face, for, o' my conscience, twenty</span><br/>
<span id='42'>of the dog-days now reign in's nose; all that stand</span><br/>
<span id='43'>about him are under the line, they need no other</span><br/>
<span id='44'>penance: that fire-drake did I hit three times on</span><br/>
<span id='45'>the head, and three times was his nose discharged</span><br/>
<span id='46'>against me; he stands there, like a mortar-piece, to</span><br/>
<span id='47'>blow us. There was a haberdasher's wife of small</span><br/>
<span id='48'>wit near him, that railed upon me till her pinked</span><br/>
<span id='49'>porringer fell off her head, for kindling such a</span><br/>
<span id='50'>combustion in the state. I missed the meteor once,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>and hit that woman; who cried out 'Clubs!' when I</span><br/>
<span id='52'>might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to</span><br/>
<span id='53'>her succor, which were the hope o' the Strand, where</span><br/>
<span id='54'>she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my</span><br/>
<span id='55'>place: at length they came to the broom-staff to</span><br/>
<span id='56'>me; I defied 'em still: when suddenly a file of</span><br/>
<span id='57'>boys behind 'em, loose shot, delivered such a shower</span><br/>
<span id='58'>of pebbles, that I was fain to draw mine honour in,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>and let 'em win the work: the devil was amongst</span><br/>
<span id='60'>'em, I think, surely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Porter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>and fight for bitten apples; that no audience, but</span><br/>
<span id='63'>the tribulation of Tower-hill, or the limbs of</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Limehouse, their dear brothers, are able to endure.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>I have some of 'em in Limbo Patrum, and there they</span><br/>
<span id='66'>are like to dance these three days; besides the</span><br/>
<span id='67'>running banquet of two beadles that is to come.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Chamberlain</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Mercy o' me, what a multitude are here!</span><br/>
<span id='69'>They grow still too; from all parts they are coming,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>These lazy knaves? Ye have made a fine hand, fellows:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>There's a trim rabble let in: are all these</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Your faithful friends o' the suburbs? We shall have</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>When they pass back from the christening.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Porter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>An't please</span><br/>
<span id='77'>your honour,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>We are but men; and what so many may do,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Not being torn a-pieces, we have done:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>An army cannot rule 'em.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>As I live,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>If the king blame me for't, I'll lay ye all</span><br/>
<span id='83'>By the heels, and suddenly; and on your heads</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Clap round fines for neglect: ye are lazy knaves;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>They're come already from the christening:</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Go, break among the press, and find a way out</span><br/>
<span id='89'>To let the troop pass fairly; or I'll find</span><br/>
<span id='90'>A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Porter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Make way there for the princess.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Man</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>You great fellow,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Stand close up, or I'll make your head ache.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Porter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>You i' the camlet, get up o' the rail;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>I'll peck you o'er the pales else.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

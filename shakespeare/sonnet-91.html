<h3>XCI</h3>
<p>
Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,<br/>
Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,<br/>
Some in their garments though new-fangled ill;<br/>
Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;<br/>
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,<br/>
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:<br/>
But these particulars are not my measure,<br/>
All these I better in one general best.<br/>
Thy love is better than high birth to me,<br/>
Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,<br/>
Of more delight than hawks and horses be;<br/>
And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this away, and me most wretched make.<br/>

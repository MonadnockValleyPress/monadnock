<h1>King Lear</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>A hall in the same.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KENT, disguised</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>If but as well I other accents borrow,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>That can my speech defuse, my good intent</span><br/>
<span id='3'>May carry through itself to that full issue</span><br/>
<span id='4'>For which I razed my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>So may it come, thy master, whom thou lovest,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Shall find thee full of labours.</span><br/>
<p><em>Horns within. Enter KING LEAR, Knights, and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit an Attendant</em></p>
<span id='9'>How now! what art thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>A man, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>What dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve</span><br/>
<span id='13'>him truly that will put me in trust: to love him</span><br/>
<span id='14'>that is honest; to converse with him that is wise,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>and says little; to fear judgment; to fight when I</span><br/>
<span id='16'>cannot choose; and to eat no fish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>What art thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a</span><br/>
<span id='20'>king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Who wouldst thou serve?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>You.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Dost thou know me, fellow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>No, sir; but you have that in your countenance</span><br/>
<span id='26'>which I would fain call master.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>What's that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Authority.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>What services canst thou do?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious</span><br/>
<span id='31'>tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message</span><br/>
<span id='32'>bluntly: that which ordinary men are fit for, I am</span><br/>
<span id='33'>qualified in; and the best of me is diligence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>How old art thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor</span><br/>
<span id='36'>so old to dote on her for any thing: I have years</span><br/>
<span id='37'>on my back forty eight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Follow me; thou shalt serve me: if I like thee no</span><br/>
<span id='39'>worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Dinner, ho, dinner! Where's my knave? my fool?</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Go you, and call my fool hither.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit an Attendant</em></p>
<p><em>Enter OSWALD</em></p>
<span id='42'>You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>So please you,&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit a Knight</em></p>
<span id='45'>Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's asleep.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Knight</em></p>
<span id='46'>How now! where's that mongrel?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Knight</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Why came not the slave back to me when I called him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Knight</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would</span><br/>
<span id='50'>not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>He would not!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Knight</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>My lord, I know not what the matter is; but, to my</span><br/>
<span id='53'>judgment, your highness is not entertained with that</span><br/>
<span id='54'>ceremonious affection as you were wont; there's a</span><br/>
<span id='55'>great abatement of kindness appears as well in the</span><br/>
<span id='56'>general dependants as in the duke himself also and</span><br/>
<span id='57'>your daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Ha! sayest thou so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Knight</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>for my duty cannot be silent when I think your</span><br/>
<span id='61'>highness wronged.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I</span><br/>
<span id='63'>have perceived a most faint neglect of late; which I</span><br/>
<span id='64'>have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity</span><br/>
<span id='65'>than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>I will look further into't. But where's my fool? I</span><br/>
<span id='67'>have not seen him this two days.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Knight</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the</span><br/>
<span id='69'>fool hath much pined away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you, and</span><br/>
<span id='71'>tell my daughter I would speak with her.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit an Attendant</em></p>
<span id='72'>Go you, call hither my fool.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit an Attendant</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter OSWALD</em></p>
<span id='73'>O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>My lady's father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>'My lady's father'! my lord's knave: your</span><br/>
<span id='77'>whoreson dog! you slave! you cur!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?</span><br/>
<p><em>Striking him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>I'll not be struck, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Nor tripped neither, you base football player.</span><br/>
<p><em>Tripping up his heels</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>I thank thee, fellow; thou servest me, and I'll</span><br/>
<span id='83'>love thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>away, away! if you will measure your lubber's</span><br/>
<span id='86'>length again, tarry: but away! go to; have you</span><br/>
<span id='87'>wisdom? so.</span><br/>
<p><em>Pushes OSWALD out</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there's</span><br/>
<span id='89'>earnest of thy service.</span><br/>
<p><em>Giving KENT money</em></p>
<p><em>Enter Fool</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Let me hire him too: here's my coxcomb.</span><br/>
<p><em>Offering KENT his cap</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>How now, my pretty knave! how dost thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Why, fool?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Why, for taking one's part that's out of favour:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>thou'lt catch cold shortly: there, take my coxcomb:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>why, this fellow has banished two on's daughters,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>and did the third a blessing against his will; if</span><br/>
<span id='99'>thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>How now, nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Why, my boy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs</span><br/>
<span id='103'>myself. There's mine; beg another of thy daughters.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Take heed, sirrah; the whip.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped</span><br/>
<span id='106'>out, when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>A pestilent gall to me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Mark it, nuncle:</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Have more than thou showest,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Speak less than thou knowest,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Lend less than thou owest,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Ride more than thou goest,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Learn more than thou trowest,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Set less than thou throwest;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Leave thy drink and thy whore,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>And keep in-a-door,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And thou shalt have more</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Than two tens to a score.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>This is nothing, fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer; you</span><br/>
<span id='123'>gave me nothing for't. Can you make no use of</span><br/>
<span id='124'>nothing, nuncle?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>[To KENT]  Prithee, tell him, so much the rent of</span><br/>
<span id='127'>his land comes to: he will not believe a fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>A bitter fool!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a</span><br/>
<span id='130'>bitter fool and a sweet fool?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>No, lad; teach me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>That lord that counsell'd thee</span><br/>
<span id='133'>To give away thy land,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Come place him here by me,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Do thou for him stand:</span><br/>
<span id='136'>The sweet and bitter fool</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Will presently appear;</span><br/>
<span id='138'>The one in motley here,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>The other found out there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Dost thou call me fool, boy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>All thy other titles thou hast given away; that</span><br/>
<span id='142'>thou wast born with.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>This is not altogether fool, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>No, faith, lords and great men will not let me; if</span><br/>
<span id='145'>I had a monopoly out, they would have part on't:</span><br/>
<span id='146'>and ladies too, they will not let me have all fool</span><br/>
<span id='147'>to myself; they'll be snatching. Give me an egg,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>nuncle, and I'll give thee two crowns.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>What two crowns shall they be?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Why, after I have cut the egg i' the middle, and eat</span><br/>
<span id='151'>up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou</span><br/>
<span id='152'>clovest thy crown i' the middle, and gavest away</span><br/>
<span id='153'>both parts, thou borest thy ass on thy back o'er</span><br/>
<span id='154'>the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak</span><br/>
<span id='156'>like myself in this, let him be whipped that first</span><br/>
<span id='157'>finds it so.</span><br/>
<p><em>Singing</em></p>
<span id='158'>Fools had ne'er less wit in a year;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>For wise men are grown foppish,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>They know not how their wits to wear,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Their manners are so apish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy</span><br/>
<span id='164'>daughters thy mothers: for when thou gavest them</span><br/>
<span id='165'>the rod, and put'st down thine own breeches,</span><br/>
<p><em>Singing</em></p>
<span id='166'>Then they for sudden joy did weep,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>And I for sorrow sung,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>That such a king should play bo-peep,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>And go the fools among.</span><br/><br/>
<span id='170'>Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach</span><br/>
<span id='171'>thy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:</span><br/>
<span id='174'>they'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt</span><br/>
<span id='175'>have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I am</span><br/>
<span id='176'>whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any</span><br/>
<span id='177'>kind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not be</span><br/>
<span id='178'>thee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>and left nothing i' the middle: here comes one o'</span><br/>
<span id='180'>the parings.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GONERIL</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>How now, daughter! what makes that frontlet on?</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to</span><br/>
<span id='184'>care for her frowning; now thou art an O without a</span><br/>
<span id='185'>figure: I am better than thou art now; I am a fool,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>thou art nothing.</span><br/>
<p><em>To GONERIL</em></p>
<span id='187'>Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue; so your face</span><br/>
<span id='188'>bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>He that keeps nor crust nor crum,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Weary of all, shall want some.</span><br/>
<p><em>Pointing to KING LEAR</em></p>
<span id='191'>That's a shealed peascod.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>But other of your insolent retinue</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth</span><br/>
<span id='195'>In rank and not-to-be endured riots. Sir,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>I had thought, by making this well known unto you,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>By what yourself too late have spoke and done.</span><br/>
<span id='199'>That you protect this course, and put it on</span><br/>
<span id='200'>By your allowance; which if you should, the fault</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Might in their working do you that offence,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Which else were shame, that then necessity</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Will call discreet proceeding.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>For, you trow, nuncle,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>That it's had it head bit off by it young.</span><br/>
<span id='209'>So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>Are you our daughter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='211'>Come, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='212'>I would you would make use of that good wisdom,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away</span><br/>
<span id='214'>These dispositions, that of late transform you</span><br/>
<span id='215'>From what you rightly are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>Fool</strong></span>

<span id='220'>Either his notion weakens, his discernings</span><br/>
<span id='221'>Are lethargied&mdash;Ha! waking? 'tis not so.</span><br/>
<span id='222'>Who is it that can tell me who I am?</span><br/>

<span id='speech81'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='223'>Lear's shadow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='224'>I would learn that; for, by the</span><br/>
<span id='225'>marks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason,</span><br/>
<span id='226'>I should be false persuaded I had daughters.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='227'>Which they will make an obedient father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='228'>Your name, fair gentlewoman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='229'>This admiration, sir, is much o' the savour</span><br/>
<span id='230'>Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you</span><br/>
<span id='231'>To understand my purposes aright:</span><br/>
<span id='232'>As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.</span><br/>
<span id='233'>Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;</span><br/>
<span id='234'>Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>That this our court, infected with their manners,</span><br/>
<span id='236'>Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust</span><br/>
<span id='237'>Make it more like a tavern or a brothel</span><br/>

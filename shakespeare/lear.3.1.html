<h1>King Lear</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>A heath.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Storm still. Enter KENT and a Gentleman, meeting</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Who's there, besides foul weather?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>One minded like the weather, most unquietly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>I know you. Where's the king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Contending with the fretful element:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn</span><br/>
<span id='11'>The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The lion and the belly-pinched wolf</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And bids what will take all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>But who is with him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>None but the fool; who labours to out-jest</span><br/>
<span id='18'>His heart-struck injuries.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Sir, I do know you;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And dare, upon the warrant of my note,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Although as yet the face of it be cover'd</span><br/>
<span id='23'>With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Who have&mdash;as who have not, that their great stars</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Throned and set high?&mdash;servants, who seem no less,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Which are to France the spies and speculations</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Or the hard rein which both of them have borne</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Against the old kind king; or something deeper,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>But, true it is, from France there comes a power</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Wise in our negligence, have secret feet</span><br/>
<span id='35'>In some of our best ports, and are at point</span><br/>
<span id='36'>To show their open banner. Now to you:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>If on my credit you dare build so far</span><br/>
<span id='38'>To make your speed to Dover, you shall find</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Some that will thank you, making just report</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow</span><br/>
<span id='41'>The king hath cause to plain.</span><br/>
<span id='42'>I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer</span><br/>
<span id='44'>This office to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>I will talk further with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>No, do not.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>For confirmation that I am much more</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take</span><br/>
<span id='49'>What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>As fear not but you shall,&mdash;show her this ring;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And she will tell you who your fellow is</span><br/>
<span id='52'>That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!</span><br/>
<span id='53'>I will go seek the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Give me your hand: have you no more to say?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>That, when we have found the king,&mdash;in which your pain</span><br/>
<span id='57'>That way, I'll this,&mdash;he that first lights on him</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Holla the other.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt severally</em></p>

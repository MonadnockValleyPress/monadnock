<h1>Henry VI, Part 3</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Edward's camp, near Warwick.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter three Watchmen, to guard KING EDWARD IV's tent</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Come on, my masters, each man take his stand:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The king by this is set him down to sleep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>What, will he not to bed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Never to lie and take his natural rest</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>To-morrow then belike shall be the day,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>If Warwick be so near as men report.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Third Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>But say, I pray, what nobleman is that</span><br/>
<span id='10'>That with the king here resteth in his tent?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>First Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Third Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>O, is it so? But why commands the king</span><br/>
<span id='13'>That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>While he himself keeps in the cold field?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Second Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Third Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Ay, but give me worship and quietness;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>I like it better than a dangerous honour.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>First Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Second Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>But to defend his person from night-foes?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter WARWICK, CLARENCE, OXFORD, SOMERSET, and French soldiers, silent all</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Courage, my masters! honour now or never!</span><br/>
<span id='25'>But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>First Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Who goes there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Second Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Stay, or thou diest!</span><br/>
<p><em>WARWICK and the rest cry all, 'Warwick! Warwick!'  and set upon the Guard, who fly, crying, 'Arm! arm!' WARWICK and the rest following them</em></p>
<p><em>The drum playing and trumpet sounding, reenter  WARWICK, SOMERSET, and the rest, bringing KING  EDWARD IV out in his gown, sitting in a chair. RICHARD and HASTINGS fly over the stage</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>What are they that fly there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>        The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Thou call'dst me king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Ay, but the case is alter'd:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>When you disgraced me in my embassade,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Then I degraded you from being king,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And come now to create you Duke of York.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>That know not how to use ambassadors,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Nor how to be contented with one wife,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Nor how to study for the people's welfare,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Of thee thyself and all thy complices,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Edward will always bear himself as king:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:</span><br/>
<p><em>Takes off his crown</em></p>
<span id='50'>But Henry now shall wear the English crown,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>My Lord of Somerset, at my request,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>I'll follow you, and tell what answer</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York.</span><br/>
<p><em>They lead him out forcibly</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>What fates impose, that men must needs abide;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>It boots not to resist both wind and tide.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit, guarded</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>OXFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>What now remains, my lords, for us to do</span><br/>
<span id='62'>But march to London with our soldiers?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>To free King Henry from imprisonment</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And see him seated in the regal throne.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

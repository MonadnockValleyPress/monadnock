<h1>King John</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>A room in a castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter HUBERT and Executioners</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Within the arras: when I strike my foot</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And bind the boy which you shall find with me</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence, and watch.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Executioner</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to't.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Executioners</em></p>
<span id='8'>Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ARTHUR</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Good morrow, Hubert.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Good morrow, little prince.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>As little prince, having so great a title</span><br/>
<span id='12'>To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Indeed, I have been merrier.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Mercy on me!</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Methinks no body should be sad but I:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Yet, I remember, when I was in France,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Only for wantonness. By my christendom,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>So I were out of prison and kept sheep,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>I should be as merry as the day is long;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And so I would be here, but that I doubt</span><br/>
<span id='22'>My uncle practises more harm to me:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>He is afraid of me and I of him:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?</span><br/>
<span id='25'>No, indeed, is't not; and I would to heaven</span><br/>
<span id='26'>I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>[Aside]  If I talk to him, with his innocent prate</span><br/>
<span id='28'>He will awake my mercy which lies dead:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Are you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>In sooth, I would you were a little sick,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>That I might sit all night and watch with you:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>I warrant I love you more than you do me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>[Aside]  His words do take possession of my bosom.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Read here, young Arthur.</span><br/>
<p><em>Showing a paper</em></p>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='36'>How now, foolish rheum!</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Turning dispiteous torture out of door!</span><br/>
<span id='38'>I must be brief, lest resolution drop</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Young boy, I must.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>                  And will you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>And I will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I knit my handercher about your brows,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The best I had, a princess wrought it me,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And I did never ask it you again;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And with my hand at midnight held your head,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And like the watchful minutes to the hour,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Saying, 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?'</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Many a poor man's son would have lien still</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>But you at your sick service had a prince.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Nay, you may think my love was crafty love</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And call it cunning: do, an if you will:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?</span><br/>
<span id='62'>These eyes that never did nor never shall</span><br/>
<span id='63'>So much as frown on you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>I have sworn to do it;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And with hot irons must I burn them out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!</span><br/>
<span id='67'>The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And quench his fiery indignation</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Even in the matter of mine innocence;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Nay, after that, consume away in rust</span><br/>
<span id='72'>But for containing fire to harm mine eye.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?</span><br/>
<span id='74'>An if an angel should have come to me</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>I would not have believed him,&mdash;no tongue but Hubert's.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Come forth.</span><br/>
<p><em>Stamps</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter Executioners, with a cord, irons,  & c</em></p>
<span id='78'>Do as I bid you do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>O, save me, Hubert, save me! my eyes are out</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Alas, what need you be so boisterous-rough?</span><br/>
<span id='83'>I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Nor look upon the iron angerly:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Whatever torment you do put me to.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Go, stand within; let me alone with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>First Executioner</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>I am best pleased to be from such a deed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Executioners</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Alas, I then have chid away my friend!</span><br/>
<span id='94'>He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Let him come back, that his compassion may</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Give life to yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Come, boy, prepare yourself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Is there no remedy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>None, but to lose your eyes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Any annoyance in that precious sense!</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Though to no use but still to look on you!</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold</span><br/>
<span id='113'>And would not harm me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>I can heat it, boy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with grief,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Being create for comfort, to be used</span><br/>
<span id='117'>In undeserved extremes: see else yourself;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>There is no malice in this burning coal;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out</span><br/>
<span id='120'>And strew'd repentent ashes on his head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>But with my breath I can revive it, boy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>An if you do, you will but make it blush</span><br/>
<span id='123'>And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.</span><br/>
<span id='127'>All things that you should use to do me wrong</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Deny their office: only you do lack</span><br/>
<span id='129'>That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye</span><br/>
<span id='132'>For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>With this same very iron to burn them out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>O, now you look like Hubert! all this while</span><br/>
<span id='136'>You were disguised.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Peace; no more. Adieu.</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Your uncle must not know but you are dead;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:</span><br/>
<span id='140'>And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Will not offend thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Silence; no more: go closely in with me:</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Much danger do I undergo for thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

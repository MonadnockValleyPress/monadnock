<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>London. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Corporal NYM and Lieutenant BARDOLPH</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Well met, Corporal Nym.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>For my part, I care not: I say little; but when</span><br/>
<span id='5'>time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that</span><br/>
<span id='6'>shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will</span><br/>
<span id='7'>wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one; but</span><br/>
<span id='8'>what though? it will toast cheese, and it will</span><br/>
<span id='9'>endure cold as another man's sword will: and</span><br/>
<span id='10'>there's an end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and</span><br/>
<span id='12'>we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it</span><br/>
<span id='13'>be so, good Corporal Nym.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the</span><br/>
<span id='15'>certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I</span><br/>
<span id='16'>will do as I may: that is my rest, that is the</span><br/>
<span id='17'>rendezvous of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong; for you</span><br/>
<span id='20'>were troth-plight to her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men may</span><br/>
<span id='22'>sleep, and they may have their throats about them at</span><br/>
<span id='23'>that time; and some say knives have edges. It must</span><br/>
<span id='24'>be as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet</span><br/>
<span id='25'>she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I</span><br/>
<span id='26'>cannot tell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PISTOL and Hostess</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good</span><br/>
<span id='28'>corporal, be patient here. How now, mine host Pistol!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Base tike, call'st thou me host? Now, by this hand,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>I swear, I scorn the term; Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Hostess</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and</span><br/>
<span id='32'>board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live</span><br/>
<span id='33'>honestly by the prick of their needles, but it will</span><br/>
<span id='34'>be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.</span><br/>
<p><em>NYM and PISTOL draw</em></p>
<span id='35'>O well a day, Lady, if he be not drawn now! we</span><br/>
<span id='36'>shall see wilful adultery and murder committed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Good lieutenant! good corporal! offer nothing here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Pish!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Pish for thee, Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of Iceland!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Hostess</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put up your sword.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Will you shog off? I would have you solus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>'Solus,' egregious dog? O viper vile!</span><br/>
<span id='43'>The 'solus' in thy most mervailous face;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>The 'solus' in thy teeth, and in thy throat,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I do retort the 'solus' in thy bowels;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And flashing fire will follow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have an</span><br/>
<span id='51'>humour to knock you indifferently well. If you grow</span><br/>
<span id='52'>foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my</span><br/>
<span id='53'>rapier, as I may, in fair terms: if you would walk</span><br/>
<span id='54'>off, I would prick your guts a little, in good</span><br/>
<span id='55'>terms, as I may: and that's the humour of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>O braggart vile and damned furious wight!</span><br/>
<span id='57'>The grave doth gape, and doting death is near;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Therefore exhale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the</span><br/>
<span id='60'>first stroke, I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.</span><br/>
<p><em>Draws</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>An oath of mickle might; and fury shall abate.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Thy spirits are most tall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>I will cut thy throat, one time or other, in fair</span><br/>
<span id='65'>terms: that is the humour of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>'Couple a gorge!'</span><br/>
<span id='67'>That is the word. I thee defy again.</span><br/>
<span id='68'>O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?</span><br/>
<span id='69'>No; to the spital go,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And from the powdering tub of infamy</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>I have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly</span><br/>
<span id='74'>For the only she; and&mdash;pauca, there's enough. Go to.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the Boy</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Boy</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master, and</span><br/>
<span id='76'>you, hostess: he is very sick, and would to bed.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets, and</span><br/>
<span id='78'>do the office of a warming-pan. Faith, he's very ill.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Away, you rogue!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Hostess</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of</span><br/>
<span id='81'>these days. The king has killed his heart. Good</span><br/>
<span id='82'>husband, come home presently.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Hostess and Boy</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to</span><br/>
<span id='84'>France together: why the devil should we keep</span><br/>
<span id='85'>knives to cut one another's throats?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Let floods o'erswell, and fiends for food howl on!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Base is the slave that pays.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>That now I will have: that's the humour of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>As manhood shall compound: push home.</span><br/>
<p><em>They draw</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>By this sword, he that makes the first thrust, I'll</span><br/>
<span id='92'>kill him; by this sword, I will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be friends:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>an thou wilt not, why, then, be enemies with me too.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Prithee, put up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at betting?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>A noble shalt thou have, and present pay;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And liquor likewise will I give to thee,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And friendship shall combine, and brotherhood:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>I'll live by Nym, and Nym shall live by me;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Is not this just? for I shall sutler be</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Unto the camp, and profits will accrue.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Give me thy hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>I shall have my noble?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>In cash most justly paid.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Well, then, that's the humour of't.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Hostess</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Hostess</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>As ever you came of women, come in quickly to Sir</span><br/>
<span id='109'>John. Ah, poor heart! he is so shaked of a burning</span><br/>
<span id='110'>quotidian tertian, that it is most lamentable to</span><br/>
<span id='111'>behold. Sweet men, come to him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>The king hath run bad humours on the knight; that's</span><br/>
<span id='113'>the even of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Nym, thou hast spoke the right;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>His heart is fracted and corroborate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>NYM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>The king is a good king: but it must be as it may;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>he passes some humours and careers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Let us condole the knight; for, lambkins we will live.</span><br/>

<h1>Henry VIII</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The Council-Chamber.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Chancellor; places himself at the upper end  of the table on the left hand; a seat being left  void above him, as for CRANMER's seat. SUFFOLK,  NORFOLK, SURREY, Chamberlain, GARDINER, seat  themselves in order on each side. CROMWELL at lower end, as secretary. Keeper at the door</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Chancellor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Speak to the business, master-secretary:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Why are we met in council?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CROMWELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Please your honours,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>The chief cause concerns his grace of Canterbury.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Has he had knowledge of it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CROMWELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Yes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Who waits there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Keeper</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Without, my noble lords?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Yes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Keeper</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>My lord archbishop;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Chancellor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Let him come in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Keeper</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>                  Your grace may enter now.</span><br/>
<p><em>CRANMER enters and approaches the council-table</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Chancellor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>My good lord archbishop, I'm very sorry</span><br/>
<span id='15'>To sit here at this present, and behold</span><br/>
<span id='16'>That chair stand empty: but we all are men,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>In our own natures frail, and capable</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Of our flesh; few are angels: out of which frailty</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Toward the king first, then his laws, in filling</span><br/>
<span id='22'>The whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>For so we are inform'd, with new opinions,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Which reformation must be sudden too,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>But stop their mouths with stubborn bits, and spur 'em,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Out of our easiness and childish pity</span><br/>
<span id='32'>To one man's honour, this contagious sickness,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Farewell all physic: and what follows then?</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Commotions, uproars, with a general taint</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Of the whole state: as, of late days, our neighbours,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>The upper Germany, can dearly witness,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Yet freshly pitied in our memories.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>My good lords, hitherto, in all the progress</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And with no little study, that my teaching</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And the strong course of my authority</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Might go one way, and safely; and the end</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Was ever, to do well: nor is there living,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>I speak it with a single heart, my lords,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>A man that more detests, more stirs against,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Both in his private conscience and his place,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Defacers of a public peace, than I do.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Pray heaven, the king may never find a heart</span><br/>
<span id='49'>With less allegiance in it! Men that make</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Envy and crooked malice nourishment</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>That, in this case of justice, my accusers,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And freely urge against me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Nay, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>That cannot be: you are a counsellor,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And, by that virtue, no man dare accuse you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>My lord, because we have business of more moment,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>We will be short with you. 'Tis his highness' pleasure,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And our consent, for better trial of you,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>From hence you be committed to the Tower;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Where, being but a private man again,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>More than, I fear, you are provided for.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>You are always my good friend; if your will pass,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>You are so merciful: I see your end;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>'Tis my undoing: love and meekness, lord,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Become a churchman better than ambition:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Win straying souls with modesty again,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>I make as little doubt, as you do conscience</span><br/>
<span id='75'>In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>But reverence to your calling makes me modest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>My lord, my lord, you are a sectary,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>That's the plain truth: your painted gloss discovers,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>To men that understand you, words and weakness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CROMWELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>My Lord of Winchester, you are a little,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>However faulty, yet should find respect</span><br/>
<span id='83'>For what they have been: 'tis a cruelty</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To load a falling man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Good master secretary,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Of all this table, say so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CROMWELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Why, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Do not I know you for a favourer</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Of this new sect? ye are not sound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CROMWELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Not sound?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Not sound, I say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CROMWELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>                  Would you were half so honest!</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>I shall remember this bold language.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CROMWELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Do.</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Remember your bold life too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Chancellor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>This is too much;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Forbear, for shame, my lords.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>I have done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CROMWELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>And I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Chancellor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>I take it, by all voices, that forthwith</span><br/>
<span id='104'>You be convey'd to the Tower a prisoner;</span><br/>
<span id='105'>There to remain till the king's further pleasure</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Be known unto us: are you all agreed, lords?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>We are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>      Is there no other way of mercy,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>But I must needs to the Tower, my lords?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>What other</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Would you expect? you are strangely troublesome.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Let some o' the guard be ready there.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Guard</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>For me?</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Must I go like a traitor thither?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Receive him,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And see him safe i' the Tower.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Stay, good my lords,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>By virtue of that ring, I take my cause</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Out of the gripes of cruel men, and give it</span><br/>
<span id='121'>To a most noble judge, the king my master.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>This is the king's ring.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>SURREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>'Tis no counterfeit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>'Tis the right ring, by heaven: I told ye all,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>When ye first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>'Twould fall upon ourselves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Do you think, my lords,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>The king will suffer but the little finger</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Of this man to be vex'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Chancellor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>'Tis now too certain:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>How much more is his life in value with him?</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Would I were fairly out on't!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CROMWELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>My mind gave me,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>In seeking tales and informations</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Against this man, whose honesty the devil</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And his disciples only envy at,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Ye blew the fire that burns ye: now have at ye!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter KING, frowning on them; takes his seat</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven</span><br/>
<span id='139'>In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince;</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Not only good and wise, but most religious:</span><br/>
<span id='141'>One that, in all obedience, makes the church</span><br/>
<span id='142'>The chief aim of his honour; and, to strengthen</span><br/>
<span id='143'>That holy duty, out of dear respect,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>His royal self in judgment comes to hear</span><br/>
<span id='145'>The cause betwixt her and this great offender.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>You were ever good at sudden commendations,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Bishop of Winchester. But know, I come not</span><br/>
<span id='148'>To hear such flattery now, and in my presence;</span><br/>
<span id='149'>They are too thin and bare to hide offences.</span><br/>
<span id='150'>To me you cannot reach, you play the spaniel,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>But, whatsoe'er thou takest me for, I'm sure</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.</span><br/>
<p><em>To CRANMER</em></p>
<span id='154'>Good man, sit down. Now let me see the proudest</span><br/>
<span id='155'>He, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee:</span><br/>
<span id='156'>By all that's holy, he had better starve</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Than but once think this place becomes thee not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>SURREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>May it please your grace,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>No, sir, it does not please me.</span><br/>
<span id='160'>I had thought I had had men of some understanding</span><br/>
<span id='161'>And wisdom of my council; but I find none.</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>This good man,&mdash;few of you deserve that title,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='164'>This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy</span><br/>
<span id='165'>At chamber&mdash;door? and one as great as you are?</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Power as he was a counsellor to try him,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Not as a groom: there's some of ye, I see,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>More out of malice than integrity,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Which ye shall never have while I live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Chancellor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>Thus far,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>My most dread sovereign, may it like your grace</span><br/>
<span id='175'>To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Concerning his imprisonment, was rather,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>If there be faith in men, meant for his trial,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>And fair purgation to the world, than malice,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>I'm sure, in me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Well, well, my lords, respect him;</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Take him, and use him well, he's worthy of it.</span><br/>
<span id='182'>I will say thus much for him, if a prince</span><br/>
<span id='183'>May be beholding to a subject, I</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Am, for his love and service, so to him.</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Make me no more ado, but all embrace him:</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Canterbury,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>I have a suit which you must not deny me;</span><br/>
<span id='189'>That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>You must be godfather, and answer for her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>The greatest monarch now alive may glory</span><br/>
<span id='192'>In such an honour: how may I deserve it</span><br/>
<span id='193'>That am a poor and humble subject to you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>Come, come, my lord, you'ld spare your spoons: you</span><br/>
<span id='195'>shall have two noble partners with you; the old</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Duchess of Norfolk, and Lady Marquess Dorset: will</span><br/>
<span id='197'>these please you?</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Embrace and love this man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>With a true heart</span><br/>
<span id='201'>And brother-love I do it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>And let heaven</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Witness, how dear I hold this confirmation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart:</span><br/>
<span id='205'>The common voice, I see, is verified</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Of thee, which says thus, 'Do my Lord of Canterbury</span><br/>
<span id='207'>A shrewd turn, and he is your friend for ever.'</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long</span><br/>
<span id='209'>To have this young one made a Christian.</span><br/>
<span id='210'>As I have made ye one, lords, one remain;</span><br/>
<span id='211'>So I grow stronger, you more honour gain.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>London. The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV sick, QUEEN  ELIZABETH, DORSET, RIVERS, HASTINGS, BUCKINGHAM, GREY, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>You peers, continue this united league:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>I every day expect an embassage</span><br/>
<span id='4'>From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>RIVERS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Take heed you dally not before your king;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Lest he that is the supreme King of kings</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Confound your hidden falsehood, and award</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Either of you to be the other's end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>RIVERS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>You have been factious one against the other,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And what you do, do it unfeignedly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Here, Hastings; I will never more remember</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DORSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>This interchange of love, I here protest,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Upon my part shall be unviolable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>And so swear I, my lord</span><br/>
<p><em>They embrace</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league</span><br/>
<span id='30'>With thy embracements to my wife's allies,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And make me happy in your unity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate</span><br/>
<span id='33'>On you or yours,</span><br/>
<p><em>To the Queen</em></p>
<span id='34'>but with all duteous love</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me</span><br/>
<span id='36'>With hate in those where I expect most love!</span><br/>
<span id='37'>When I have most need to employ a friend,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And most assured that he is a friend</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>When I am cold in zeal to yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>To make the perfect period of this peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GLOUCESTER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And, princely peers, a happy time of day!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Brother, we done deeds of charity;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Amongst this princely heap, if any here,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Hold me a foe;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>If I unwittingly, or in my rage,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Have aught committed that is hardly borne</span><br/>
<span id='59'>By any in this presence, I desire</span><br/>
<span id='60'>To reconcile me to his friendly peace:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>'Tis death to me to be at enmity;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>I hate it, and desire all good men's love.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Which I will purchase with my duteous service;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>If ever any grudge were lodged between us;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>That without desert have frown'd on me;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>I do not know that Englishman alive</span><br/>
<span id='71'>With whom my soul is any jot at odds</span><br/>
<span id='72'>More than the infant that is born to-night</span><br/>
<span id='73'>I thank my God for my humility.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>I would to God all strifes were well compounded.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty</span><br/>
<span id='77'>To take our brother Clarence to your grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this</span><br/>
<span id='79'>To be so bouted in this royal presence?</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?</span><br/>
<p><em>They all start</em></p>
<span id='81'>You do him injury to scorn his corse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>RIVERS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>All seeing heaven, what a world is this!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DORSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence</span><br/>
<span id='86'>But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>But he, poor soul, by your first order died,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And that a winged Mercury did bear:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>That came too lag to see him buried.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And yet go current from suspicion!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DERBY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DERBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DERBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>I will not rise, unless your highness grant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DERBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And shall the same give pardon to a slave?</span><br/>
<span id='105'>My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And yet his punishment was cruel death.</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Who told me how the poor soul did forsake</span><br/>
<span id='111'>The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury</span><br/>
<span id='113'>When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Who told me, when we both lay in the field</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Even in his own garments, and gave himself,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?</span><br/>
<span id='119'>All this from my remembrance brutish wrath</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Had so much grace to put it in my mind.</span><br/>
<span id='122'>But when your carters or your waiting-vassals</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced</span><br/>
<span id='124'>The precious image of our dear Redeemer,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;</span><br/>
<span id='126'>And I unjustly too, must grant it you</span><br/>
<span id='127'>But for my brother not a man would speak,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself</span><br/>
<span id='129'>For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Have been beholding to him in his life;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Yet none of you would once plead for his life.</span><br/>
<span id='132'>O God, I fear thy justice will take hold</span><br/>
<span id='133'>On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Oh, poor Clarence!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt some with KING EDWARD IV and QUEEN MARGARET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not</span><br/>
<span id='137'>How that the guilty kindred of the queen</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?</span><br/>
<span id='139'>O, they did urge it still unto the king!</span><br/>
<span id='140'>God will revenge it. But come, let us in,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>To comfort Edward with our company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>We wait upon your grace.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

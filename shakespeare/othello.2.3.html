<h1>Othello</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene III</h3>
<h4>A hall in the castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Not to outsport discretion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Iago hath direction what to do;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Will I look to't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>                  Iago is most honest.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Let me have speech with you.</span><br/>
<p><em>To DESDEMONA</em></p>
<span id='10'>Come, my dear love,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Good night.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants</em></p>
<p><em>Enter IAGO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the</span><br/>
<span id='16'>clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love</span><br/>
<span id='17'>of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and</span><br/>
<span id='19'>she is sport for Jove.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>She's a most exquisite lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>And, I'll warrant her, fun of game.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of</span><br/>
<span id='24'>provocation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>She is indeed perfection.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I</span><br/>
<span id='29'>have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace</span><br/>
<span id='30'>of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to</span><br/>
<span id='31'>the health of black Othello.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and</span><br/>
<span id='33'>unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish</span><br/>
<span id='34'>courtesy would invent some other custom of</span><br/>
<span id='35'>entertainment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for</span><br/>
<span id='37'>you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was</span><br/>
<span id='39'>craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation</span><br/>
<span id='40'>it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>and dare not task my weakness with any more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants</span><br/>
<span id='43'>desire it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Where are they?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>I'll do't; but it dislikes me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>If I can fasten but one cup upon him,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>With that which he hath drunk to-night already,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>He'll be as full of quarrel and offence</span><br/>
<span id='50'>As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>To Desdemona hath to-night caroused</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>That hold their honours in a wary distance,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>The very elements of this warlike isle,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Am I to put our Cassio in some action</span><br/>
<span id='60'>That may offend the isle.&mdash;But here they come:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>If consequence do but approve my dream,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen; servants following with wine</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>MONTANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am</span><br/>
<span id='65'>a soldier.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Some wine, ho!</span><br/>
<p><em>Sings</em></p>
<span id='67'>And let me the canakin clink, clink;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And let me the canakin clink</span><br/>
<span id='69'>A soldier's a man;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>A life's but a span;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Why, then, let a soldier drink.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Some wine, boys!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>'Fore God, an excellent song.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are</span><br/>
<span id='75'>most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and</span><br/>
<span id='76'>your swag-bellied Hollander&mdash;Drink, ho!&mdash;are nothing</span><br/>
<span id='77'>to your English.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead</span><br/>
<span id='80'>drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he</span><br/>
<span id='81'>gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle</span><br/>
<span id='82'>can be filled.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>To the health of our general!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MONTANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>O sweet England!</span><br/>
<span id='86'>King Stephen was a worthy peer,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>His breeches cost him but a crown;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>He held them sixpence all too dear,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>With that he call'd the tailor lown.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>He was a wight of high renown,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And thou art but of low degree:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>'Tis pride that pulls the country down;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Then take thine auld cloak about thee.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Some wine, ho!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Will you hear't again?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that</span><br/>
<span id='98'>does those things. Well, God's above all; and there</span><br/>
<span id='99'>be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>It's true, good lieutenant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>For mine own part,&mdash;no offence to the general, nor</span><br/>
<span id='102'>any man of quality,&mdash;I hope to be saved.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>And so do I too, lieutenant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the</span><br/>
<span id='105'>lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's</span><br/>
<span id='106'>have no more of this; let's to our affairs.&mdash;Forgive</span><br/>
<span id='107'>us our sins!&mdash;Gentlemen, let's look to our business.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my</span><br/>
<span id='109'>ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and</span><br/>
<span id='111'>speak well enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Excellent well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MONTANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>You see this fellow that is gone before;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And give direction: and do but see his vice;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>I fear the trust Othello puts him in.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>On some odd time of his infirmity,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Will shake this island.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>MONTANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>But is he often thus?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>He'll watch the horologe a double set,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>If drink rock not his cradle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MONTANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>It were well</span><br/>
<span id='128'>The general were put in mind of it.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And looks not on his evils: is not this true?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter RODERIGO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>[Aside to him]  How now, Roderigo!</span><br/>
<span id='133'>I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit RODERIGO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MONTANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Should hazard such a place as his own second</span><br/>
<span id='136'>With one of an ingraft infirmity:</span><br/>
<span id='137'>It were an honest action to say</span><br/>
<span id='138'>So to the Moor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>                  Not I, for this fair island:</span><br/>
<span id='140'>I do love Cassio well; and would do much</span><br/>
<span id='141'>To cure him of this evil&mdash;But, hark! what noise?</span><br/>
<p><em>Cry within: 'Help! help!'</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGO</em></p>

<span id='143'>What's the matter, lieutenant?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>

<span id='144'>A knave teach me my duty!</span><br/>
<span id='145'>I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='146'>Beat me!</span><br/>

<span id='149'>I pray you, sir, hold your hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>

<span id='151'>Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Drunk!</span><br/>
<p><em>They fight</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>[Aside to RODERIGO]  Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit RODERIGO</em></p>

<span id='159'>Who's that which rings the bell?&mdash;Diablo, ho!</span><br/>
<span id='160'>The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!</span><br/>
<span id='161'>You will be shamed for ever.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter OTHELLO and Attendants</em></p>

<span id='162'>What is the matter here?</span><br/>

<span id='speech63'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?</span><br/>
<span id='171'>For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:</span><br/>
<span id='172'>He that stirs next to carve for his own rage</span><br/>

<span id='176'>Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.</span><br/>

<span id='222'>Touch me not so near:</span><br/>
<span id='223'>I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth</span><br/>
<span id='224'>Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.</span><br/>
<span id='227'>Montano and myself being in speech,</span><br/>
<span id='228'>There comes a fellow crying out for help:</span><br/>
<span id='229'>And Cassio following him with determined sword,</span><br/>
<span id='230'>To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:</span><br/>
<span id='232'>Myself the crying fellow did pursue,</span><br/>
<span id='233'>Lest by his clamour&mdash;as it so fell out&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='234'>The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather</span><br/>
<span id='236'>For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,</span><br/>
<span id='237'>And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night</span><br/>
<span id='238'>I ne'er might say before. When I came back&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='239'>For this was brief&mdash;I found them close together,</span><br/>
<span id='240'>At blow and thrust; even as again they were</span><br/>
<span id='241'>When you yourself did part them.</span><br/>
<span id='242'>More of this matter cannot I report:</span><br/>

<span id='244'>Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,</span><br/>
<span id='245'>As men in rage strike those that wish them best,</span><br/>
<span id='246'>Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received</span><br/>
<span id='247'>From him that fled some strange indignity,</span><br/>
<span id='248'>Which patience could not pass.</span><br/>

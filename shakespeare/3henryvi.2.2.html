<h1>Henry VI, Part 3</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Before York.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET,  PRINCE EDWARD, CLIFFORD, and NORTHUMBERLAND, with drum and trumpets</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy</span><br/>
<span id='3'>That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>To see this sight, it irks my very soul.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>My gracious liege, this too much lenity</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And harmful pity must be laid aside.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Not to the beast that would usurp their den.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Not his that spoils her young before her face.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Not he that sets his foot upon her back.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>He, but a duke, would have his son a king,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And raise his issue, like a loving sire;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Didst yield consent to disinherit him,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Which argued thee a most unloving father.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Unreasonable creatures feed their young;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Yet, in protection of their tender ones,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Who hath not seen them, even with those wings</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Offer their own lives in their young's defence?</span><br/>
<span id='33'>For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Were it not pity that this goodly boy</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And long hereafter say unto his child,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got</span><br/>
<span id='38'>My careless father fondly gave away'?</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And let his manly face, which promiseth</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart</span><br/>
<span id='42'>To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Inferring arguments of mighty force.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear</span><br/>
<span id='46'>That things ill-got had ever bad success?</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And happy always was it for that son</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?</span><br/>
<span id='49'>I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And would my father had left me no more!</span><br/>
<span id='51'>For all the rest is held at such a rate</span><br/>
<span id='52'>As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Than in possession and jot of pleasure.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know</span><br/>
<span id='55'>How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And this soft courage makes your followers faint.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>You promised knighthood to our forward son:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Edward, kneel down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PRINCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>My gracious father, by your kingly leave,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And in that quarrel use it to the death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Royal commanders, be in readiness:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>For with a band of thirty thousand men</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And in the towns, as they do march along,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>I would your highness would depart the field:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>The queen hath best success when you are absent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Be it with resolution then to fight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>My royal father, cheer these noble lords</span><br/>
<span id='79'>And hearten those that fight in your defence:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'</span><br/>
<p><em>March. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, WARWICK, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, and Soldiers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>EDWARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And set thy diadem upon my head;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>EDWARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>I am his king, and he should bow his knee;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>I was adopted heir by his consent:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Have caused him, by new act of parliament,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>To blot out me, and put his own son in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>And reason too:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Who should succeed the father but the son?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Or any he the proudest of thy sort.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?</span><br/>
<span id='103'>When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Your legs did better service than your hands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>You said so much before, and yet you fled.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain</span><br/>
<span id='111'>The execution of my big-swoln heart</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>I am a king, and privileged to speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:</span><br/>
<span id='124'>By him that made us all, I am resolved</span><br/>
<span id='125'>that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>EDWARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?</span><br/>
<span id='127'>A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>For York in justice puts his armour on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>If that be right which Warwick says is right,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>There is no wrong, but every thing is right.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;</span><br/>
<span id='134'>For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;</span><br/>
<span id='136'>But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Whose father bears the title of a king,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>As if a channel should be call'd the sea,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>EDWARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>To make this shameless callet know herself.</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Although thy husband may be Menelaus;</span><br/>
<span id='148'>And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd</span><br/>
<span id='149'>By that false woman, as this king by thee.</span><br/>
<span id='150'>His father revell'd in the heart of France,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>And had he match'd according to his state,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>He might have kept that glory to this day;</span><br/>
<span id='154'>But when he took a beggar to his bed,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.</span><br/>
<span id='159'>For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;</span><br/>
<span id='161'>And we, in pity of the gentle king,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Had slipp'd our claim until another age.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>GEORGE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>And that thy summer bred us no increase,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>We set the axe to thy usurping root;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>EDWARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>And, in this resolution, I defy thee;</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Not willing any longer conference,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!</span><br/>
<span id='174'>And either victory, or else a grave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>Stay, Edward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>EDWARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:</span><br/>
<span id='177'>These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene V</h3>
<h4>Scene V. Capulet's orchard.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>It was the nightingale, and not the lark,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>It was the lark, the herald of the morn,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>I must be gone and live, or stay and die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>It is some meteor that the sun exhales,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And light thee on thy way to Mantua:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I am content, so thou wilt have it so.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat</span><br/>
<span id='22'>The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>I have more care to stay than will to go:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!</span><br/>
<span id='27'>It is the lark that sings so out of tune,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Some say the lark makes sweet division;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>This doth not so, for she divideth us:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>O, now I would they had changed voices too!</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Nurse, to the chamber</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Madam!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Nurse?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>The day is broke; be wary, look about.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Then, window, let day in, and let life out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.</span><br/>
<p><em>He goeth down</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!</span><br/>
<span id='44'>I must hear from thee every day in the hour,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>For in a minute there are many days:</span><br/>
<span id='46'>O, by this count I shall be much in years</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Ere I again behold my Romeo!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Farewell!</span><br/>
<span id='49'>I will omit no opportunity</span><br/>
<span id='50'>That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve</span><br/>
<span id='53'>For sweet discourses in our time to come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>O God, I have an ill-divining soul!</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>But send him back.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>[Within]         Ho, daughter! are you up?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Is she not down so late, or up so early?</span><br/>
<span id='68'>What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LADY CAPULET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Why, how now, Juliet!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Madam, I am not well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?</span><br/>
<span id='72'>What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?</span><br/>
<span id='73'>An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>But much of grief shows still some want of wit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Which you weep for.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Feeling so the loss,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>What villain madam?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>That same villain, Romeo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>[Aside]  Villain and he be many miles asunder.&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>That is, because the traitor murderer lives.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Indeed, I never shall be satisfied</span><br/>
<span id='98'>With Romeo, till I behold him&mdash;dead&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Madam, if you could find out but a man</span><br/>
<span id='101'>To bear a poison, I would temper it;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors</span><br/>
<span id='104'>To hear him named, and cannot come to him.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>To wreak the love I bore my cousin</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Upon his body that slaughter'd him!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>And joy comes well in such a needy time:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>What are they, I beseech your ladyship?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Madam, in happy time, what day is that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>The gallant, young and noble gentleman,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>He shall not make me there a joyful bride.</span><br/>
<span id='122'>I wonder at this haste; that I must wed</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.</span><br/>
<span id='124'>I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And see how he will take it at your hands.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CAPULET and Nurse</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>But for the sunset of my brother's son</span><br/>
<span id='132'>It rains downright.</span><br/>
<span id='133'>How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Evermore showering? In one little body</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;</span><br/>
<span id='136'>For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Without a sudden calm, will overset</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Have you deliver'd to her our decree?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.</span><br/>
<span id='144'>I would the fool were married to her grave!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.</span><br/>
<span id='146'>How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought</span><br/>
<span id='149'>So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Proud can I never be of what I hate;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?</span><br/>
<span id='154'>'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'</span><br/>
<span id='155'>And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!</span><br/>
<span id='161'>You tallow-face!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>                  Fie, fie! what, are you mad?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Good father, I beseech you on my knees,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Hear me with patience but to speak a word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!</span><br/>
<span id='166'>I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Or never after look me in the face:</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest</span><br/>
<span id='170'>That God had lent us but this only child;</span><br/>
<span id='171'>But now I see this one is one too much,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And that we have a curse in having her:</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Out on her, hilding!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>God in heaven bless her!</span><br/>
<span id='175'>You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>I speak no treason.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>O, God ye god-den.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>May not one speak?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>                  Peace, you mumbling fool!</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;</span><br/>
<span id='183'>For here we need it not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>You are too hot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>God's bread! it makes me mad:</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Alone, in company, still my care hath been</span><br/>
<span id='188'>To have her match'd: and having now provided</span><br/>
<span id='189'>A gentleman of noble parentage,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;</span><br/>
<span id='193'>And then to have a wretched puling fool,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'</span><br/>
<span id='197'>But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Graze where you will you shall not house with me:</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:</span><br/>
<span id='201'>An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;</span><br/>
<span id='202'>And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in</span><br/>
<span id='203'>the streets,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<span id='speech58'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>

<span id='209'>O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Delay this marriage for a month, a week;</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed</span><br/>

<span id='218'>Unless that husband send it me from heaven</span><br/>
<span id='219'>By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.</span><br/>
<span id='220'>Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems</span><br/>

<span id='225'>Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,</span><br/>
<span id='226'>That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;</span><br/>
<span id='227'>Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,</span><br/>
<span id='229'>I think it best you married with the county.</span><br/>
<span id='230'>O, he's a lovely gentleman!</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,</span><br/>
<span id='232'>Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye</span><br/>
<span id='233'>As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,</span><br/>
<span id='234'>I think you are happy in this second match,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>For it excels your first: or if it did not,</span><br/>
<span id='236'>Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,</span><br/>
<span id='237'>As living here and you no use of him.</span><br/>

<span id='242'>What?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='243'>Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.</span><br/>
<span id='244'>Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,</span><br/>
<span id='245'>Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,</span><br/>
<span id='246'>To make confession and to be absolved.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='248'>Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!</span><br/>

<span id='250'>Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue</span><br/>
<span id='251'>Which she hath praised him with above compare</span><br/>

<h1>Richard II</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>London. King Richard II's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other Nobles and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Which then our leisure would not let us hear,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>I have, my liege.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Or worthily, as a good subject should,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>On some known ground of treachery in him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>As near as I could sift him on that argument,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>On some apparent danger seen in him</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Then call them to our presence; face to face,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear</span><br/>
<span id='17'>The accuser and the accused freely speak:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Many years of happy days befal</span><br/>
<span id='21'>My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>THOMAS MOWBRAY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Each day still better other's happiness;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Add an immortal title to your crown!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>As well appeareth by the cause you come;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Namely to appeal each other of high treason.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>First, heaven be the record to my speech!</span><br/>
<span id='31'>In the devotion of a subject's love,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Tendering the precious safety of my prince,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And free from other misbegotten hate,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Come I appellant to this princely presence.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And mark my greeting well; for what I speak</span><br/>
<span id='37'>My body shall make good upon this earth,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Too good to be so and too bad to live,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Once more, the more to aggravate the note,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>THOMAS MOWBRAY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Yet can I not of such tame patience boast</span><br/>
<span id='53'>As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me</span><br/>
<span id='55'>From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Which else would post until it had return'd</span><br/>
<span id='57'>These terms of treason doubled down his throat.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Setting aside his high blood's royalty,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And let him be no kinsman to my liege,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>I do defy him, and I spit at him;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Which to maintain I would allow him odds,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And meet him, were I tied to run afoot</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Or any other ground inhabitable,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Mean time let this defend my loyalty,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And lay aside my high blood's royalty,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>If guilty dread have left thee so much strength</span><br/>
<span id='74'>As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>By that and all the rites of knighthood else,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>THOMAS MOWBRAY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>I take it up; and by that sword I swear</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I'll answer thee in any fair degree,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And when I mount, alive may I not light,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>If I be traitor or unjustly fight!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?</span><br/>
<span id='85'>It must be great that can inherit us</span><br/>
<span id='86'>So much as of a thought of ill in him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles</span><br/>
<span id='89'>In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Like a false traitor and injurious villain.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Besides I say and will in battle prove,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge</span><br/>
<span id='94'>That ever was survey'd by English eye,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>That all the treasons for these eighteen years</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Complotted and contrived in this land</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Further I say and further will maintain</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Upon his bad life to make all this good,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>And consequently, like a traitor coward,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>To me for justice and rough chastisement;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And, by the glorious worth of my descent,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>How high a pitch his resolution soars!</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>THOMAS MOWBRAY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>O, let my sovereign turn away his face</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And bid his ears a little while be deaf,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Till I have told this slander of his blood,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>How God and good men hate so foul a liar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>As he is but my father's brother's son,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize</span><br/>
<span id='121'>The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>THOMAS MOWBRAY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;</span><br/>
<span id='128'>The other part reserved I by consent,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>For that my sovereign liege was in my debt</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Upon remainder of a dear account,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>I slew him not; but to my own disgrace</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Neglected my sworn duty in that case.</span><br/>
<span id='135'>For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>The honourable father to my foe</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Once did I lay an ambush for your life,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul</span><br/>
<span id='139'>But ere I last received the sacrament</span><br/>
<span id='140'>I did confess it, and exactly begg'd</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.</span><br/>
<span id='142'>This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>It issues from the rancour of a villain,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>A recreant and most degenerate traitor</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Which in myself I boldly will defend;</span><br/>
<span id='146'>And interchangeably hurl down my gage</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Upon this overweening traitor's foot,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>To prove myself a loyal gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.</span><br/>
<span id='150'>In haste whereof, most heartily I pray</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Your highness to assign our trial day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Let's purge this choler without letting blood:</span><br/>
<span id='154'>This we prescribe, though no physician;</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Deep malice makes too deep incision;</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Good uncle, let this end where it begun;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>To be a make-peace shall become my age:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>And, Norfolk, throw down his.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>When, Harry, when?</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Obedience bids I should not bid again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>THOMAS MOWBRAY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.</span><br/>
<span id='167'>My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:</span><br/>
<span id='168'>The one my duty owes; but my fair name,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Despite of death that lives upon my grave,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.</span><br/>
<span id='171'>I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Which breathed this poison.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>Rage must be withstood:</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>THOMAS MOWBRAY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.</span><br/>
<span id='178'>And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>The purest treasure mortal times afford</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Is spotless reputation: that away,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.</span><br/>
<span id='182'>A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Take honour from me, and my life is done:</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;</span><br/>
<span id='187'>In that I live and for that will I die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear</span><br/>
<span id='195'>The slavish motive of recanting fear,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit JOHN OF GAUNT</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>We were not born to sue, but to command;</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Which since we cannot do to make you friends,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:</span><br/>
<span id='202'>There shall your swords and lances arbitrate</span><br/>
<span id='203'>The swelling difference of your settled hate:</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Since we can not atone you, we shall see</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Justice design the victor's chivalry.</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Lord marshal, command our officers at arms</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Be ready to direct these home alarms.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

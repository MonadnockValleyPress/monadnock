<blockquote>
<span id='1'>'But for mine own part, my lord, I could be well</span><br/>
<span id='2'>contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear</span><br/>
<span id='3'>your house.' He could be contented: why is he not,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>then? In respect of the love he bears our house:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than</span><br/>
<span id='6'>he loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The</span><br/>
<span id='7'>purpose you undertake is dangerous;'&mdash;why, that's</span><br/>
<span id='8'>certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to</span><br/>
<span id='9'>drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this</span><br/>
<span id='10'>nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The</span><br/>
<span id='11'>purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you</span><br/>
<span id='12'>have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and</span><br/>
<span id='13'>your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so</span><br/>
<span id='14'>great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so? I say</span><br/>
<span id='15'>unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and</span><br/>
<span id='16'>you lie.  What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our</span><br/>
<span id='18'>friends true and constant: a good plot, good</span><br/>
<span id='19'>friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is</span><br/>
<span id='21'>this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot and the</span><br/>
<span id='22'>general course of action. 'Zounds, an I were now by</span><br/>
<span id='23'>this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Edmund Mortimer, My lord of York and Owen Glendower?</span><br/>
<span id='26'>is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all</span><br/>
<span id='27'>their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the</span><br/>
<span id='28'>next month? and are they not some of them set</span><br/>
<span id='29'>forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an</span><br/>
<span id='30'>infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity</span><br/>
<span id='31'>of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay</span><br/>
<span id='32'>open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself</span><br/>
<span id='33'>and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of</span><br/>
<span id='34'>skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him!</span><br/>
<span id='35'>let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set</span><br/>
<span id='36'>forward to-night.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LADY PERCY</em></p>
<span id='37'>How now, Kate! I must leave you within these two hours.</span><br/>

<span id='38'>O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?</span><br/>
<span id='39'>For what offence have I this fortnight been</span><br/>
<span id='40'>A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep?</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And start so often when thou sit'st alone?</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And given my treasures and my rights of thee</span><br/>
<span id='47'>To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?</span><br/>
<span id='48'>In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And all the currents of a heady fight.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Such as we see when men restrain their breath</span><br/>
<span id='63'>On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And I must know it, else he loves me not.</span><br/>

<span id='88'>Come, come, you paraquito, answer me</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Directly unto this question that I ask:</span><br/>

<span id='94'>I care not for thee, Kate: this is no world</span><br/>
<span id='95'>To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,</span><br/>

<span id='105'>And when I am on horseback, I will swear</span><br/>

<h1>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Before the monument of MARINA at Tarsus.</h4>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter GOWER, before the monument of MARINA at Tarsus</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GOWER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for't;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Making, to take your imagination,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>From bourn to bourn, region to region.</span><br/>
<span id='64'>By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime</span><br/>
<span id='65'>To use one language in each several clime</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you</span><br/>
<span id='67'>To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>The stages of our story. Pericles</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Attended on by many a lord and knight.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>To see his daughter, all his life's delight.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Advanced in time to great and high estate,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Old Helicanus goes along behind.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought</span><br/>
<span id='77'>This king to Tarsus,&mdash;think his pilot thought;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>DUMB SHOW.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his train;  CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other. CLEON shows  PERICLES the tomb; whereat PERICLES makes  lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty passion departs. Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA</em></p>
<span id='83'>See how belief may suffer by foul show!</span><br/>
<span id='84'>This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>With sighs shot through, and biggest tears</span><br/>
<span id='87'>o'ershower'd,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears</span><br/>
<span id='91'>A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>The epitaph is for Marina writ</span><br/>
<span id='94'>By wicked Dionyza.</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument</em></p>
<span id='95'>'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Who wither'd in her spring of year.</span><br/>
<span id='97'>She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'</span><br/>
<span id='105'>No visor does become black villany</span><br/>
<span id='106'>So well as soft and tender flattery.</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And bear his courses to be ordered</span><br/>
<span id='109'>By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play</span><br/>
<span id='110'>His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day</span><br/>
<span id='111'>In her unholy service. Patience, then,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And think you now are all in Mytilene.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<h1>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Before the monument of Marina at Tarsus.</h4>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter GOWER, before the monument of MARINA at Tarsus</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GOWER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for't;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Making, to take your imagination,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>From bourn to bourn, region to region.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime</span><br/>
<span id='6'>To use one language in each several clime</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you</span><br/>
<span id='8'>To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>The stages of our story. Pericles</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Attended on by many a lord and knight.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>To see his daughter, all his life's delight.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Advanced in time to great and high estate,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Old Helicanus goes along behind.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought</span><br/>
<span id='18'>This king to Tarsus,&mdash;think his pilot thought;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.</span><br/>
<p>DUMB SHOW.</p>
<p><em>Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his train;  CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other. CLEON shows  PERICLES the tomb; whereat PERICLES makes  lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty passion departs. Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA</em></p>
<span id='23'>See how belief may suffer by foul show!</span><br/>
<span id='24'>This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>With sighs shot through, and biggest tears</span><br/>
<span id='27'>o'ershower'd,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears</span><br/>
<span id='31'>A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>The epitaph is for Marina writ</span><br/>
<span id='34'>By wicked Dionyza.</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument</em></p>
<span id='35'>'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Who wither'd in her spring of year.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'</span><br/>
<span id='45'>No visor does become black villany</span><br/>
<span id='46'>So well as soft and tender flattery.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And bear his courses to be ordered</span><br/>
<span id='49'>By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play</span><br/>
<span id='50'>His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day</span><br/>
<span id='51'>In her unholy service. Patience, then,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And think you now are all in Mytilene.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

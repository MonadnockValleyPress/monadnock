<h1>Henry VIII</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</h3>
<h4>An ante-chamber in the palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Chamberlain, reading a letter</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>'My lord, the horses your lordship sent for, with</span><br/>
<span id='2'>all the care I had, I saw well chosen, ridden, and</span><br/>
<span id='3'>furnished. They were young and handsome, and of the</span><br/>
<span id='4'>best breed in the north. When they were ready to</span><br/>
<span id='5'>set out for London, a man of my lord cardinal's, by</span><br/>
<span id='6'>commission and main power, took 'em from me; with</span><br/>
<span id='7'>this reason: His master would be served before a</span><br/>
<span id='8'>subject, if not before the king; which stopped our</span><br/>
<span id='9'>mouths, sir.'</span><br/>
<span id='10'>I fear he will indeed: well, let him have them:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>He will have all, I think.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter, to Chamberlain, NORFOLK and SUFFOLK</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Well met, my lord chamberlain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Good day to both your graces.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>How is the king employ'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>I left him private,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Full of sad thoughts and troubles.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>What's the cause?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>It seems the marriage with his brother's wife</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Has crept too near his conscience.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>No, his conscience</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Has crept too near another lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>'Tis so:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>This is the cardinal's doing, the king-cardinal:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Turns what he list. The king will know him one day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Pray God he do! he'll never know himself else.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>How holily he works in all his business!</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And with what zeal! for, now he has crack'd the league</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Between us and the emperor, the queen's great nephew,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>He dives into the king's soul, and there scatters</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Fears, and despairs; and all these for his marriage:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And out of all these to restore the king,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>He counsels a divorce; a loss of her</span><br/>
<span id='35'>That, like a jewel, has hung twenty years</span><br/>
<span id='36'>About his neck, yet never lost her lustre;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Of her that loves him with that excellence</span><br/>
<span id='38'>That angels love good men with; even of her</span><br/>
<span id='39'>That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Will bless the king: and is not this course pious?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Heaven keep me from such counsel! 'Tis most true</span><br/>
<span id='42'>These news are every where; every tongue speaks 'em,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And every true heart weeps for't: all that dare</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Look into these affairs see this main end,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>The French king's sister. Heaven will one day open</span><br/>
<span id='46'>The king's eyes, that so long have slept upon</span><br/>
<span id='47'>This bold bad man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>                  And free us from his slavery.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>We had need pray,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And heartily, for our deliverance;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Or this imperious man will work us all</span><br/>
<span id='52'>From princes into pages: all men's honours</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Lie like one lump before him, to be fashion'd</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Into what pitch he please.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>For me, my lords,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>I love him not, nor fear him; there's my creed:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>As I am made without him, so I'll stand,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>If the king please; his curses and his blessings</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Touch me alike, they're breath I not believe in.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him</span><br/>
<span id='61'>To him that made him proud, the pope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Let's in;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And with some other business put the king</span><br/>
<span id='64'>From these sad thoughts, that work too much upon him:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>My lord, you'll bear us company?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Excuse me;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>The king has sent me otherwhere: besides,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Health to your lordships.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Thanks, my good lord chamberlain.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Chamberlain; and KING HENRY VIII draws the curtain, and sits reading pensively</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>How sad he looks! sure, he is much afflicted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Who's there, ha?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>                  Pray God he be not angry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Who's there, I say? How dare you thrust yourselves</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Into my private meditations?</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Who am I? ha?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>A gracious king that pardons all offences</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Malice ne'er meant: our breach of duty this way</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Is business of estate; in which we come</span><br/>
<span id='80'>To know your royal pleasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Ye are too bold:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Go to; I'll make ye know your times of business:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Is this an hour for temporal affairs, ha?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS, with a commission</em></p>
<span id='84'>Who's there? my good lord cardinal? O my Wolsey,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>The quiet of my wounded conscience;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Thou art a cure fit for a king.</span><br/>
<p><em>To CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</em></p>
<span id='87'>You're welcome,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Most learned reverend sir, into our kingdom:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Use us and it.</span><br/>
<p><em>To CARDINAL WOLSEY</em></p>
<span id='90'>My good lord, have great care</span><br/>
<span id='91'>I be not found a talker.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Sir, you cannot.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>I would your grace would give us but an hour</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Of private conference.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>[To NORFOLK and SUFFOLK]</span><br/>
<span id='96'>We are busy; go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>[Aside to SUFFOLK]</span><br/>
<span id='98'>This priest has no pride in him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>[Aside to NORFOLK]             Not to speak of:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>I would not be so sick though for his place:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>But this cannot continue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>[Aside to SUFFOLK]      If it do,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>I'll venture one have-at-him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>[Aside to NORFOLK]          I another.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt NORFOLK and SUFFOLK</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Your grace has given a precedent of wisdom</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Above all princes, in committing freely</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Your scruple to the voice of Christendom:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Who can be angry now? what envy reach you?</span><br/>
<span id='109'>The Spaniard, tied blood and favour to her,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Must now confess, if they have any goodness,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>The trial just and noble. All the clerks,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Have their free voices: Rome, the nurse of judgment,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Invited by your noble self, hath sent</span><br/>
<span id='115'>One general tongue unto us, this good man,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Whom once more I present unto your highness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And thank the holy conclave for their loves:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>They have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Your grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>You are so noble. To your highness' hand</span><br/>
<span id='123'>I tender my commission; by whose virtue,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>The court of Rome commanding, you, my lord</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Cardinal of York, are join'd with me their servant</span><br/>
<span id='126'>In the unpartial judging of this business.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Two equal men. The queen shall be acquainted</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Forthwith for what you come. Where's Gardiner?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>I know your majesty has always loved her</span><br/>
<span id='130'>So dear in heart, not to deny her that</span><br/>
<span id='131'>A woman of less place might ask by law:</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Scholars allow'd freely to argue for her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Ay, and the best she shall have; and my favour</span><br/>
<span id='134'>To him that does best: God forbid else. Cardinal,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Prithee, call Gardiner to me, my new secretary:</span><br/>
<span id='136'>I find him a fit fellow.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit CARDINAL WOLSEY</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, with GARDINER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>[Aside to GARDINER]  Give me your hand: much joy and</span><br/>
<span id='138'>favour to you;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>You are the king's now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>GARDINER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>[Aside to CARDINAL WOLSEY]</span><br/>
<span id='141'>But to be commanded</span><br/>
<span id='142'>For ever by your grace, whose hand has raised me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Come hither, Gardiner.</span><br/>
<p><em>Walks and whispers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>My Lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace</span><br/>
<span id='145'>In this man's place before him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Yes, he was.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Was he not held a learned man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Yes, surely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Believe me, there's an ill opinion spread then</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Even of yourself, lord cardinal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>How! of me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>They will not stick to say you envied him,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>And fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Kept him a foreign man still; which so grieved him,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>That he ran mad and died.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Heaven's peace be with him!</span><br/>
<span id='157'>That's Christian care enough: for living murmurers</span><br/>
<span id='158'>There's places of rebuke. He was a fool;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>If I command him, follows my appointment:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>I will have none so near else. Learn this, brother,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>We live not to be grip'd by meaner persons.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Deliver this with modesty to the queen.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit GARDINER</em></p>
<span id='164'>The most convenient place that I can think of</span><br/>
<span id='165'>For such receipt of learning is Black-Friars;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>There ye shall meet about this weighty business.</span><br/>
<span id='167'>My Wolsey, see it furnish'd. O, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Would it not grieve an able man to leave</span><br/>
<span id='169'>So sweet a bedfellow? But, conscience, conscience!</span><br/>
<span id='170'>O, 'tis a tender place; and I must leave her.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

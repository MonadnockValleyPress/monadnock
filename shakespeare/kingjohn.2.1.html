<h1>King John</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</H3>
<h4>France. Before Angiers.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter AUSTRIA and forces, drums, etc. on one side:  on the other KING PHILIP and his power; LEWIS, ARTHUR, CONSTANCE and attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LEWIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And fought the holy wars in Palestine,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>By this brave duke came early to his grave:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And for amends to his posterity,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>At our importance hither is he come,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And to rebuke the usurpation</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Of thy unnatural uncle, English John:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ARTHUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The rather that you give his offspring life,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Shadowing their right under your wings of war:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>I give you welcome with a powerless hand,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>But with a heart full of unstained love:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>LEWIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>AUSTRIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>As seal to this indenture of my love,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>That to my home I will no more return,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And coops from other lands her islanders,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Even till that England, hedged in with the main,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>That water-walled bulwark, still secure</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And confident from foreign purposes,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Even till that utmost corner of the west</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Will I not think of home, but follow arms.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength</span><br/>
<span id='34'>To make a more requital to your love!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>AUSTRIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords</span><br/>
<span id='36'>In such a just and charitable war.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Against the brows of this resisting town.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Call for our chiefest men of discipline,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>To cull the plots of best advantages:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>We'll lay before this town our royal bones,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>But we will make it subject to this boy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Stay for an answer to your embassy,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:</span><br/>
<span id='46'>My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>That right in peace which here we urge in war,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And then we shall repent each drop of blood</span><br/>
<span id='49'>That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CHATILLON</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>A wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Our messenger Chatillon is arrived!</span><br/>
<span id='52'>What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon, speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CHATILLON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Then turn your forces from this paltry siege</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And stir them up against a mightier task.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>England, impatient of your just demands,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time</span><br/>
<span id='59'>To land his legions all as soon as I;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>His marches are expedient to this town,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>His forces strong, his soldiers confident.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>With him along is come the mother-queen,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>With them a bastard of the king's deceased,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And all the unsettled humours of the land,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>To make hazard of new fortunes here:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Did nearer float upon the swelling tide,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>To do offence and scath in Christendom.</span><br/>
<p><em>Drum beats</em></p>
<span id='76'>The interruption of their churlish drums</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>To parley or to fight; therefore prepare.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>How much unlook'd for is this expedition!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>AUSTRIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>By how much unexpected, by so much</span><br/>
<span id='81'>We must awake endavour for defence;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>For courage mounteth with occasion:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter KING JOHN, QUEEN ELINOR, BLANCH, the BASTARD, Lords, and forces</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Peace be to France, if France in peace permit</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Our just and lineal entrance to our own;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Whiles we, God's wrathful agent, do correct</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Peace be to England, if that war return</span><br/>
<span id='90'>From France to England, there to live in peace.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>England we love; and for that England's sake</span><br/>
<span id='92'>With burden of our armour here we sweat.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>This toil of ours should be a work of thine;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>But thou from loving England art so far,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Cut off the sequence of posterity,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Out-faced infant state and done a rape</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>This little abstract doth contain that large</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And this his son; England was Geffrey's right</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And this is Geffrey's: in the name of God</span><br/>
<span id='107'>How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>When living blood doth in these temples beat,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>From whom hast thou this great commission, France,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>To draw my answer from thy articles?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>From that supernal judge, that stirs good thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='113'>In any breast of strong authority,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>To look into the blots and stains of right:</span><br/>
<span id='115'>That judge hath made me guardian to this boy:</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And by whose help I mean to chastise it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Alack, thou dost usurp authority.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>QUEEN ELINOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Let me make answer; thy usurping son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>QUEEN ELINOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Out, insolent! thy bastard shall be king,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>That thou mayst be a queen, and cheque the world!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>My bed was ever to thy son as true</span><br/>
<span id='125'>As thine was to thy husband; and this boy</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Liker in feature to his father Geffrey</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Than thou and John in manners; being as like</span><br/>
<span id='128'>As rain to water, or devil to his dam.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>My boy a bastard! By my soul, I think</span><br/>
<span id='130'>His father never was so true begot:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>It cannot be, an if thou wert his mother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>QUEEN ELINOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CONSTANCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.</span><br/>

<span id='134'>Peace!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>

<span id='135'>     Hear the crier.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>AUSTRIA</strong></a>

<span id='136'>What the devil art thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>One that will play the devil, sir, with you,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>An a' may catch your hide and you alone:</span><br/>
<span id='139'>You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>I'll smoke your skin-coat, an I catch you right;</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Sirrah, look to't; i' faith, I will, i' faith.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>BLANCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>O, well did he become that lion's robe</span><br/>
<span id='144'>That did disrobe the lion of that robe!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>It lies as sightly on the back of him</span><br/>
<span id='146'>As great Alcides' shows upon an ass:</span><br/>
<span id='147'>But, ass, I'll take that burthen from your back,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>AUSTRIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>What craker is this same that deafs our ears</span><br/>
<span id='150'>With this abundance of superfluous breath?</span><br/>

<span id='speech32'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></a>

<span id='151'>Lewis, determine what we shall do straight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>LEWIS</strong></a>

<span id='152'>Women and fools, break off your conference.</span><br/>
<span id='153'>King John, this is the very sum of all;</span><br/>
<span id='154'>England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>In right of Arthur do I claim of thee:</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?</span><br/>

<span id='158'>Arthur of Bretagne, yield thee to my hand;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And out of my dear love I'll give thee more</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Than e'er the coward hand of France can win:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Submit thee, boy.</span><br/>

<span id='163'>Do, child, go to it grandam, child:</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig:</span><br/>
<span id='166'>There's a good grandam.</span><br/>

<span id='167'>Good my mother, peace!</span><br/>
<span id='168'>I would that I were low laid in my grave:</span><br/>

<span id='173'>Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed</span><br/>
<span id='176'>To do him justice and revenge on you.</span><br/>

<span id='182'>Infortunate in nothing but in thee:</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Thy sins are visited in this poor child;</span><br/>
<span id='184'>The canon of the law is laid on him,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Being but the second generation</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.</span><br/>

<span id='188'>                  I have but this to say,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>That he is not only plagued for her sin,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>But God hath made her sin and her the plague</span><br/>
<span id='191'>On this removed issue, plague for her</span><br/>
<span id='192'>And with her plague; her sin his injury,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Her injury the beadle to her sin,</span><br/>

<span id='speech44'><strong>QUEEN ELINOR</strong></a>

<span id='196'>Thou unadvised scold, I can produce</span><br/>

<span id='554'>She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech112'><strong>KING PHILIP</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='555'>And, by my faith, this league that we have made</span><br/>
<span id='556'>Will give her sadness very little cure.</span><br/>
<span id='557'>Brother of England, how may we content</span><br/>
<span id='558'>This widow lady? In her right we came;</span><br/>
<span id='559'>Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,</span><br/>
<span id='560'>To our own vantage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech113'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='561'>We will heal up all;</span><br/>
<span id='562'>For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne</span><br/>
<span id='563'>And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town</span><br/>
<span id='564'>We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;</span><br/>
<span id='565'>Some speedy messenger bid her repair</span><br/>
<span id='566'>To our solemnity: I trust we shall,</span><br/>
<span id='567'>If not fill up the measure of her will,</span><br/>
<span id='568'>Yet in some measure satisfy her so</span><br/>
<span id='569'>That we shall stop her exclamation.</span><br/>
<span id='570'>Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,</span><br/>
<span id='571'>To this unlook'd for, unprepared pomp.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but the BASTARD</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech114'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='572'>Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!</span><br/>
<span id='573'>John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,</span><br/>
<span id='574'>Hath willingly departed with a part,</span><br/>
<span id='575'>And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,</span><br/>
<span id='576'>Whom zeal and charity brought to the field</span><br/>
<span id='577'>As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear</span><br/>
<span id='578'>With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,</span><br/>
<span id='579'>That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,</span><br/>
<span id='580'>That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,</span><br/>
<span id='581'>Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,</span><br/>
<span id='582'>Who, having no external thing to lose</span><br/>
<span id='583'>But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,</span><br/>
<span id='584'>That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,</span><br/>
<span id='585'>Commodity, the bias of the world,</span><br/>
<span id='586'>The world, who of itself is peised well,</span><br/>
<span id='587'>Made to run even upon even ground,</span><br/>
<span id='588'>Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,</span><br/>
<span id='589'>This sway of motion, this Commodity,</span><br/>
<span id='590'>Makes it take head from all indifferency,</span><br/>
<span id='591'>From all direction, purpose, course, intent:</span><br/>
<span id='592'>And this same bias, this Commodity,</span><br/>
<span id='593'>This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,</span><br/>
<span id='594'>Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,</span><br/>
<span id='595'>Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,</span><br/>
<span id='596'>From a resolved and honourable war,</span><br/>
<span id='597'>To a most base and vile-concluded peace.</span><br/>
<span id='598'>And why rail I on this Commodity?</span><br/>
<span id='599'>But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:</span><br/>
<span id='600'>Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,</span><br/>
<span id='601'>When his fair angels would salute my palm;</span><br/>
<span id='602'>But for my hand, as unattempted yet,</span><br/>
<span id='603'>Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.</span><br/>
<span id='604'>Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail</span><br/>
<span id='605'>And say there is no sin but to be rich;</span><br/>
<span id='606'>And being rich, my virtue then shall be</span><br/>
<span id='607'>To say there is no vice but beggary.</span><br/>
<span id='608'>Since kings break faith upon commodity,</span><br/>
<span id='609'>Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

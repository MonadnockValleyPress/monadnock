<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Paris. The King's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and divers Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Have fought with equal fortune and continue</span><br/>
<span id='3'>A braving war.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>                  So 'tis reported, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it</span><br/>
<span id='6'>A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>With caution that the Florentine will move us</span><br/>
<span id='8'>For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Prejudicates the business and would seem</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To have us make denial.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>His love and wisdom,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Approved so to your majesty, may plead</span><br/>
<span id='13'>For amplest credence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>He hath arm'd our answer,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And Florence is denied before he comes:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see</span><br/>
<span id='17'>The Tuscan service, freely have they leave</span><br/>
<span id='18'>To stand on either part.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>It well may serve</span><br/>
<span id='20'>A nursery to our gentry, who are sick</span><br/>
<span id='21'>For breathing and exploit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>What's he comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Young Bertram.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>                  Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>My thanks and duty are your majesty's.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>I would I had that corporal soundness now,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>As when thy father and myself in friendship</span><br/>
<span id='32'>First tried our soldiership! He did look far</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Into the service of the time and was</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>But on us both did haggish age steal on</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And wore us out of act. It much repairs me</span><br/>
<span id='37'>To talk of your good father. In his youth</span><br/>
<span id='38'>He had the wit which I can well observe</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To-day in our young lords; but they may jest</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Till their own scorn return to them unnoted</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Ere they can hide their levity in honour;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>His equal had awaked them, and his honour,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Clock to itself, knew the true minute when</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Exception bid him speak, and at this time</span><br/>
<span id='47'>His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him</span><br/>
<span id='48'>He used as creatures of another place</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Making them proud of his humility,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Might be a copy to these younger times;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now</span><br/>
<span id='54'>But goers backward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>His good remembrance, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>So in approof lives not his epitaph</span><br/>
<span id='58'>As in your royal speech.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Would I were with him! He would always say&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words</span><br/>
<span id='61'>He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>To grow there and to bear,&mdash;'Let me not live,'&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>This his good melancholy oft began,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>When it was out,&mdash;'Let me not live,' quoth he,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses</span><br/>
<span id='68'>All but new things disdain; whose judgments are</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>I after him do after him wish too,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>I quickly were dissolved from my hive,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>To give some labourers room.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>You are loved, sir:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>They that least lend it you shall lack you first.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Since the physician at your father's died?</span><br/>
<span id='79'>He was much famed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>                  Some six months since, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>If he were living, I would try him yet.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out</span><br/>
<span id='83'>With several applications; nature and sickness</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>My son's no dearer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Thank your majesty.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt. Flourish</em></p>

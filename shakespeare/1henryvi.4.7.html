<h4>Another part of the field.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Alarum: excursions. Enter TALBOT led by a Servant</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>TALBOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Where is my other life? mine own is gone;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>O, where's young Talbot? where is valiant John?</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>When he perceived me shrink and on my knee,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And, like a hungry lion, did commence</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>But when my angry guardant stood alone,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Tendering my ruin and assail'd of none,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Suddenly made him from my side to start</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Into the clustering battle of the French;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And in that sea of blood my boy did drench</span><br/>
<span id='15'>His over-mounting spirit, and there died,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>O, my dear lord, lo, where your son is borne!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Soldiers, with the body of JOHN TALBOT</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>TALBOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Thou antic death, which laugh'st us here to scorn,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Anon, from thy insulting tyranny,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Coupled in bonds of perpetuity,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>In thy despite shall 'scape mortality.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>O, thou, whose wounds become hard-favour'd death,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Brave death by speaking, whether he will or no;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Poor boy! he smiles, methinks, as who should say,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Had death been French, then death had died to-day.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Come, come and lay him in his father's arms:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>My spirit can no longer bear these harms.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave.</span><br/>
<p><em>Dies</em></p>
<p><em>Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BURGUNDY, BASTARD OF ORLEANS, JOAN LA PUCELLE, and forces</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Had York and Somerset brought rescue in,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>We should have found a bloody day of this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>How the young whelp of Talbot's, raging-wood,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen's blood!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid:'</span><br/>
<span id='39'>But, with a proud majestical high scorn,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born</span><br/>
<span id='41'>To be the pillage of a giglot wench:'</span><br/>
<span id='42'>So, rushing in the bowels of the French,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>He left me proudly, as unworthy fight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Doubtless he would have made a noble knight;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>See, where he lies inhearsed in the arms</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Whose life was England's glory, Gallia's wonder.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>O, no, forbear! for that which we have fled</span><br/>
<span id='50'>During the life, let us not wrong it dead.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Sir William LUCY, attended; Herald of the French preceding</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LUCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin's tent,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>To know who hath obtained the glory of the day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>On what submissive message art thou sent?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LUCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Submission, Dauphin! 'tis a mere French word;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>We English warriors wot not what it means.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And to survey the bodies of the dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>For prisoners ask'st thou? hell our prison is.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>But tell me whom thou seek'st.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LUCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>But where's the great Alcides of the field,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Created, for his rare success in arms,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Great Earl of Washford, Waterford and Valence;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Lord Strange of Blackmere, Lord Verdun of Alton,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Lord Cromwell of Wingfield, Lord Furnival of Sheffield,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>The thrice-victorious Lord of Falconbridge;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Knight of the noble order of Saint George,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Worthy Saint Michael and the Golden Fleece;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Great marshal to Henry the Sixth</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Of all his wars within the realm of France?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Here is a silly stately style indeed!</span><br/>
<span id='73'>The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Writes not so tedious a style as this.</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LUCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Is Talbot slain, the Frenchmen's only scourge,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Your kingdom's terror and black Nemesis?</span><br/>
<span id='79'>O, were mine eyeballs into bullets turn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>That I in rage might shoot them at your faces!</span><br/>
<span id='81'>O, that I could but call these dead to life!</span><br/>
<span id='82'>It were enough to fright the realm of France:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Were but his picture left amongst you here,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>It would amaze the proudest of you all.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And give them burial as beseems their worth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>For God's sake let him have 'em; to keep them here,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>They would but stink, and putrefy the air.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Go, take their bodies hence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LUCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>I'll bear them hence; but from their ashes shall be rear'd</span><br/>
<span id='93'>A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>So we be rid of them, do with 'em what thou wilt.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And now to Paris, in this conquering vein:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>All will be ours, now bloody Talbot's slain.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

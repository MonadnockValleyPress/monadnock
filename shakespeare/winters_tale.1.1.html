<h1>Winter's Tale</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Antechamber in Leontes' palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ARCHIDAMUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on</span><br/>
<span id='2'>the like occasion whereon my services are now on</span><br/>
<span id='3'>foot, you shall see, as I have said, great</span><br/>
<span id='4'>difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CAMILLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia</span><br/>
<span id='6'>means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ARCHIDAMUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be</span><br/>
<span id='8'>justified in our loves; for indeed&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CAMILLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Beseech you,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ARCHIDAMUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>we cannot with such magnificence&mdash;in so rare&mdash;I know</span><br/>
<span id='12'>not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse</span><br/>
<span id='15'>us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CAMILLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ARCHIDAMUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me</span><br/>
<span id='18'>and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CAMILLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.</span><br/>
<span id='20'>They were trained together in their childhoods; and</span><br/>
<span id='21'>there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>which cannot choose but branch now. Since their</span><br/>
<span id='23'>more mature dignities and royal necessities made</span><br/>
<span id='24'>separation of their society, their encounters,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>though not personal, have been royally attorneyed</span><br/>
<span id='26'>with interchange of gifts, letters, loving</span><br/>
<span id='27'>embassies; that they have seemed to be together,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and</span><br/>
<span id='29'>embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed</span><br/>
<span id='30'>winds. The heavens continue their loves!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ARCHIDAMUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>I think there is not in the world either malice or</span><br/>
<span id='32'>matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable</span><br/>
<span id='33'>comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a</span><br/>
<span id='34'>gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came</span><br/>
<span id='35'>into my note.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CAMILLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it</span><br/>
<span id='37'>is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the</span><br/>
<span id='38'>subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on</span><br/>
<span id='39'>crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to</span><br/>
<span id='40'>see him a man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ARCHIDAMUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Would they else be content to die?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CAMILLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should</span><br/>
<span id='43'>desire to live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ARCHIDAMUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>If the king had no son, they would desire to live</span><br/>
<span id='45'>on crutches till he had one.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h4>Orchard of Oliver's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ORLANDO and ADAM</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion</span><br/>
<span id='2'>bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his</span><br/>
<span id='4'>blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my</span><br/>
<span id='5'>sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and</span><br/>
<span id='6'>report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more</span><br/>
<span id='8'>properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you</span><br/>
<span id='9'>that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that</span><br/>
<span id='10'>differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses</span><br/>
<span id='11'>are bred better; for, besides that they are fair</span><br/>
<span id='12'>with their feeding, they are taught their manage,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his</span><br/>
<span id='14'>brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the</span><br/>
<span id='15'>which his animals on his dunghills are as much</span><br/>
<span id='16'>bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so</span><br/>
<span id='17'>plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave</span><br/>
<span id='18'>me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets</span><br/>
<span id='19'>me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a</span><br/>
<span id='20'>brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my</span><br/>
<span id='21'>gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that</span><br/>
<span id='22'>grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I</span><br/>
<span id='23'>think is within me, begins to mutiny against this</span><br/>
<span id='24'>servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I</span><br/>
<span id='25'>know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ADAM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Yonder comes my master, your brother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will</span><br/>
<span id='28'>shake me up.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter OLIVER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Now, sir! what make you here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>What mar you then, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God</span><br/>
<span id='33'>made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?</span><br/>
<span id='36'>What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should</span><br/>
<span id='37'>come to such penury?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Know you where your are, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Know you before whom, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know</span><br/>
<span id='42'>you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle</span><br/>
<span id='43'>condition of blood, you should so know me. The</span><br/>
<span id='44'>courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that</span><br/>
<span id='45'>you are the first-born; but the same tradition</span><br/>
<span id='46'>takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers</span><br/>
<span id='47'>betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as</span><br/>
<span id='48'>you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is</span><br/>
<span id='49'>nearer to his reverence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>What, boy!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice</span><br/>
<span id='55'>a villain that says such a father begot villains.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand</span><br/>
<span id='57'>from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy</span><br/>
<span id='58'>tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ADAM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's</span><br/>
<span id='60'>remembrance, be at accord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Let me go, I say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My</span><br/>
<span id='63'>father charged you in his will to give me good</span><br/>
<span id='64'>education: you have trained me like a peasant,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like</span><br/>
<span id='66'>qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in</span><br/>
<span id='67'>me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow</span><br/>
<span id='68'>me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or</span><br/>
<span id='69'>give me the poor allottery my father left me by</span><br/>
<span id='70'>testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled</span><br/>
<span id='73'>with you; you shall have some part of your will: I</span><br/>
<span id='74'>pray you, leave me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Get you with him, you old dog.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ADAM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my</span><br/>
<span id='78'>teeth in your service. God be with my old master!</span><br/>
<span id='79'>he would not have spoke such a word.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will</span><br/>
<span id='81'>physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand</span><br/>
<span id='82'>crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DENNIS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DENNIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Calls your worship?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DENNIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>So please you, he is here at the door and importunes</span><br/>
<span id='86'>access to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Call him in.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit DENNIS</em></p>
<span id='88'>'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CHARLES</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Good morrow to your worship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the</span><br/>
<span id='91'>new court?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>that is, the old duke is banished by his younger</span><br/>
<span id='94'>brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords</span><br/>
<span id='95'>have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>therefore he gives them good leave to wander.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be</span><br/>
<span id='99'>banished with her father?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves</span><br/>
<span id='101'>her, being ever from their cradles bred together,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>that she would have followed her exile, or have died</span><br/>
<span id='103'>to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no</span><br/>
<span id='104'>less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and</span><br/>
<span id='105'>never two ladies loved as they do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Where will the old duke live?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and</span><br/>
<span id='108'>a many merry men with him; and there they live like</span><br/>
<span id='109'>the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young</span><br/>
<span id='110'>gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time</span><br/>
<span id='111'>carelessly, as they did in the golden world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a</span><br/>
<span id='114'>matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand</span><br/>
<span id='115'>that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition</span><br/>
<span id='116'>to come in disguised against me to try a fall.</span><br/>
<span id='117'>To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that</span><br/>
<span id='118'>escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him</span><br/>
<span id='119'>well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I</span><br/>
<span id='121'>must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you</span><br/>
<span id='123'>withal, that either you might stay him from his</span><br/>
<span id='124'>intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall</span><br/>
<span id='125'>run into, in that it is a thing of his own search</span><br/>
<span id='126'>and altogether against my will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which</span><br/>
<span id='128'>thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had</span><br/>
<span id='129'>myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and</span><br/>
<span id='130'>have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from</span><br/>
<span id='131'>it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:</span><br/>
<span id='132'>it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full</span><br/>
<span id='133'>of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's</span><br/>
<span id='134'>good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against</span><br/>
<span id='135'>me his natural brother: therefore use thy</span><br/>
<span id='136'>discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck</span><br/>
<span id='137'>as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if</span><br/>
<span id='138'>thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not</span><br/>
<span id='139'>mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise</span><br/>
<span id='140'>against thee by poison, entrap thee by some</span><br/>
<span id='141'>treacherous device and never leave thee till he</span><br/>
<span id='142'>hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;</span><br/>
<span id='143'>for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak</span><br/>
<span id='144'>it, there is not one so young and so villanous this</span><br/>
<span id='145'>day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but</span><br/>
<span id='146'>should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must</span><br/>
<span id='147'>blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come</span><br/>
<span id='149'>to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go</span><br/>
<span id='150'>alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and</span><br/>
<span id='151'>so God keep your worship!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>OLIVER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Farewell, good Charles.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit CHARLES</em></p>
<span id='153'>Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see</span><br/>
<span id='154'>an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never</span><br/>
<span id='156'>schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of</span><br/>
<span id='157'>all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much</span><br/>
<span id='158'>in the heart of the world, and especially of my own</span><br/>
<span id='159'>people, who best know him, that I am altogether</span><br/>
<span id='160'>misprised: but it shall not be so long; this</span><br/>
<span id='161'>wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that</span><br/>
<span id='162'>I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<h1>Measure for Measure</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>A room in the prison.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before, CLAUDIO, and Provost</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>The miserable have no other medicine</span><br/>
<span id='3'>But only hope:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Be absolute for death; either death or life</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing</span><br/>
<span id='8'>That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Servile to all the skyey influences,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>For all the accommodations that thou bear'st</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains</span><br/>
<span id='21'>That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>The mere effusion of thy proper loins,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this</span><br/>
<span id='39'>That bears the name of life? Yet in this life</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Lie hid more thousand deaths: yet death we fear,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>That makes these odds all even.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>I humbly thank you.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>To sue to live, I find I seek to die;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>[Within]  What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Provost</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Most holy sir, I thank you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ISABELLA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>My business is a word or two with Claudio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Provost</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Provost, a word with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Provost</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>As many as you please.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Now, sister, what's the comfort?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Why,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Intends you for his swift ambassador,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Therefore your best appointment make with speed;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>To-morrow you set on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Is there no remedy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>None, but such remedy as, to save a head,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>To cleave a heart in twain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>But is there any?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Yes, brother, you may live:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>There is a devilish mercy in the judge,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>If you'll implore it, that will free your life,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>But fetter you till death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Perpetual durance?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Though all the world's vastidity you had,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>To a determined scope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>But in what nature?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>In such a one as, you consenting to't,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And leave you naked.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Let me know the point.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And six or seven winters more respect</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?</span><br/>
<span id='83'>The sense of death is most in apprehension;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great</span><br/>
<span id='86'>As when a giant dies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Why give you me this shame?</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Think you I can a resolution fetch</span><br/>
<span id='89'>From flowery tenderness? If I must die,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>I will encounter darkness as a bride,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And hug it in mine arms.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>There spake my brother; there my father's grave</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Thou art too noble to conserve a life</span><br/>
<span id='95'>In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Whose settled visage and deliberate word</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew</span><br/>
<span id='98'>As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>His filth within being cast, he would appear</span><br/>
<span id='100'>A pond as deep as hell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>The princely Angelo?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>The damned'st body to invest and cover</span><br/>
<span id='104'>In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?</span><br/>
<span id='105'>If I would yield him my virginity,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Thou mightst be freed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>O heavens! it cannot be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>So to offend him still. This night's the time</span><br/>
<span id='110'>That I should do what I abhor to name,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Or else thou diest to-morrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Thou shalt not do't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>O, were it but my life,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>I'ld throw it down for your deliverance</span><br/>
<span id='115'>As frankly as a pin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Thanks, dear Isabel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Yes. Has he affections in him,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Which is the least?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>If it were damnable, he being so wise,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Why would he for the momentary trick</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>What says my brother?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Death is a fearful thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>And shamed life a hateful.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>This sensible warm motion to become</span><br/>
<span id='132'>A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit</span><br/>
<span id='133'>To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside</span><br/>
<span id='134'>In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;</span><br/>
<span id='135'>To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And blown with restless violence round about</span><br/>
<span id='137'>The pendent world; or to be worse than worst</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Of those that lawless and incertain thought</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!</span><br/>
<span id='140'>The weariest and most loathed worldly life</span><br/>
<span id='141'>That age, ache, penury and imprisonment</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Can lay on nature is a paradise</span><br/>
<span id='143'>To what we fear of death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Alas, alas!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>          Sweet sister, let me live:</span><br/>
<span id='146'>What sin you do to save a brother's life,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Nature dispenses with the deed so far</span><br/>
<span id='148'>That it becomes a virtue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>O you beast!</span><br/>
<span id='150'>O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Is't not a kind of incest, to take life</span><br/>
<span id='153'>From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!</span><br/>
<span id='155'>For such a warped slip of wilderness</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Die, perish! Might but my bending down</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:</span><br/>
<span id='159'>I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>No word to save thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>Nay, hear me, Isabel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>O, fie, fie, fie!</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:</span><br/>
<span id='165'>'Tis best thou diest quickly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>O hear me, Isabella!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>What is your will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and</span><br/>
<span id='170'>by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I</span><br/>
<span id='171'>would require is likewise your own benefit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be</span><br/>
<span id='173'>stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.</span><br/>
<p><em>Walks apart</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you</span><br/>
<span id='175'>and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to</span><br/>
<span id='176'>corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her</span><br/>
<span id='177'>virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition</span><br/>
<span id='178'>of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>hath made him that gracious denial which he is most</span><br/>
<span id='180'>glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I</span><br/>
<span id='181'>know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to</span><br/>
<span id='182'>death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes</span><br/>
<span id='183'>that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to</span><br/>
<span id='184'>your knees and make ready.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love</span><br/>
<span id='186'>with life that I will sue to be rid of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Hold you there: farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit CLAUDIO</em></p>
<span id='188'>Provost, a word with you!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Provost</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>Provost</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>What's your will, father?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me</span><br/>
<span id='191'>awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my</span><br/>
<span id='192'>habit no loss shall touch her by my company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>Provost</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>In good time.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:</span><br/>
<span id='195'>the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty</span><br/>
<span id='196'>brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of</span><br/>
<span id='197'>your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever</span><br/>
<span id='198'>fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but</span><br/>
<span id='200'>that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should</span><br/>
<span id='201'>wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this</span><br/>
<span id='202'>substitute, and to save your brother?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my</span><br/>
<span id='204'>brother die by the law than my son should be</span><br/>
<span id='205'>unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke</span><br/>
<span id='206'>deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can</span><br/>
<span id='207'>speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or</span><br/>
<span id='208'>discover his government.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='209'>That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter</span><br/>
<span id='210'>now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made</span><br/>
<span id='211'>trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my</span><br/>
<span id='212'>advisings: to the love I have in doing good a</span><br/>
<span id='213'>remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe</span><br/>
<span id='214'>that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged</span><br/>
<span id='215'>lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from</span><br/>
<span id='216'>the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious</span><br/>
<span id='217'>person; and much please the absent duke, if</span><br/>
<span id='218'>peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of</span><br/>
<span id='219'>this business.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='220'>Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do</span><br/>
<span id='221'>anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='222'>Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have</span><br/>
<span id='223'>you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of</span><br/>
<span id='224'>Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='225'>I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='226'>She should this Angelo have married; was affianced</span><br/>
<span id='227'>to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between</span><br/>
<span id='228'>which time of the contract and limit of the</span><br/>
<span id='229'>solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,</span><br/>
<span id='230'>having in that perished vessel the dowry of his</span><br/>
<span id='231'>sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the</span><br/>
<span id='232'>poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and</span><br/>
<span id='233'>renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most</span><br/>
<span id='234'>kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of</span><br/>
<span id='235'>her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her</span><br/>
<span id='236'>combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='237'>Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='238'>Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them</span><br/>
<span id='239'>with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,</span><br/>
<span id='240'>pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,</span><br/>
<span id='241'>bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet</span><br/>
<span id='242'>wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,</span><br/>
<span id='243'>is washed with them, but relents not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='244'>What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid</span><br/>
<span id='245'>from the world! What corruption in this life, that</span><br/>
<span id='246'>it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='247'>It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the</span><br/>
<span id='248'>cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps</span><br/>
<span id='249'>you from dishonour in doing it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='250'>Show me how, good father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='251'>This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance</span><br/>
<span id='252'>of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that</span><br/>
<span id='253'>in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,</span><br/>
<span id='254'>like an impediment in the current, made it more</span><br/>
<span id='255'>violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his</span><br/>
<span id='256'>requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with</span><br/>
<span id='257'>his demands to the point; only refer yourself to</span><br/>
<span id='258'>this advantage, first, that your stay with him may</span><br/>
<span id='259'>not be long; that the time may have all shadow and</span><br/>
<span id='260'>silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.</span><br/>
<span id='261'>This being granted in course,&mdash;and now follows</span><br/>
<span id='262'>all,&mdash;we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up</span><br/>
<span id='263'>your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter</span><br/>
<span id='264'>acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to</span><br/>
<span id='265'>her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother</span><br/>
<span id='266'>saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana</span><br/>
<span id='267'>advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid</span><br/>
<span id='268'>will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you</span><br/>
<span id='269'>think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness</span><br/>
<span id='270'>of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.</span><br/>
<span id='271'>What think you of it?</span><br/>

<span id='274'>It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily</span><br/>
<span id='275'>to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his</span><br/>
<span id='276'>bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will</span><br/>
<span id='277'>presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated</span><br/>
<span id='278'>grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that</span><br/>
<span id='279'>place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that</span><br/>
<span id='280'>it may be quickly.</span><br/>

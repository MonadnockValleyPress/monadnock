<h1>Henry VI, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The plains near Rouen.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, JOAN LA PUCELLE, and forces</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Dismay not, princes, at this accident,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>For things that are not to be remedied.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And like a peacock sweep along his tail;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>We'll pull his plumes and take away his train,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>If Dauphin and the rest will be but ruled.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CHARLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>We have been guided by thee hitherto,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And of thy cunning had no diffidence:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Search out thy wit for secret policies,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And we will make thee famous through the world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ALENCON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>We'll set thy statue in some holy place,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Employ thee then, sweet virgin, for our good.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>By fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words</span><br/>
<span id='19'>We will entice the Duke of Burgundy</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To leave the Talbot and to follow us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CHARLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>France were no place for Henry's warriors;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Nor should that nation boast it so with us,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>But be extirped from our provinces.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ALENCON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>For ever should they be expulsed from France</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And not have title of an earldom here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Your honours shall perceive how I will work</span><br/>
<span id='28'>To bring this matter to the wished end.</span><br/>
<p><em>Drum sounds afar off</em></p>
<span id='29'>Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Their powers are marching unto Paris-ward.</span><br/>
<p><em>Here sound an English march. Enter, and pass over at a distance, TALBOT and his forces</em></p>
<span id='31'>There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And all the troops of English after him.</span><br/>
<p><em>French march. Enter BURGUNDY and forces</em></p>
<span id='33'>Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Summon a parley; we will talk with him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Trumpets sound a parley</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CHARLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>The princely Charles of France, thy countryman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>What say'st thou, Charles? for I am marching hence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CHARLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy words.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France!</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Speak on; but be not over-tedious.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Look on thy country, look on fertile France,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And see the cities and the towns defaced</span><br/>
<span id='46'>By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>As looks the mother on her lowly babe</span><br/>
<span id='48'>When death doth close his tender dying eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>See, see the pining malady of France;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Which thou thyself hast given her woful breast.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>O, turn thy edged sword another way;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And wash away thy country's stained spots.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Or nature makes me suddenly relent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation</span><br/>
<span id='63'>That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?</span><br/>
<span id='64'>When Talbot hath set footing once in France</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Who then but English Henry will be lord</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And was he not in England prisoner?</span><br/>
<span id='71'>But when they heard he was thine enemy,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>They set him free without his ransom paid,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>See, then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Come, come, return; return, thou wandering lord:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And made me almost yield upon my knees.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>My forces and my power of men are yours:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>So farewell, Talbot; I'll no longer trust thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>[Aside]  Done like a Frenchman: turn, and turn again!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CHARLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Welcome, brave duke! thy friendship makes us fresh.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>And doth beget new courage in our breasts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ALENCON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And doth deserve a coronet of gold.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CHARLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Now let us on, my lords, and join our powers,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And seek how we may prejudice the foe.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>The Merchant of Venice</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene VII</h3>
<h4>Belmont. A room in Portia's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Flourish of cornets. Enter PORTIA, with the PRINCE OF MOROCCO, and their trains</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Go draw aside the curtains and discover</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The several caskets to this noble prince.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Now make your choice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>MOROCCO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'</span><br/>
<span id='6'>The second, silver, which this promise carries,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'</span><br/>
<span id='8'>This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'</span><br/>
<span id='10'>How shall I know if I do choose the right?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>The one of them contains my picture, prince:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>If you choose that, then I am yours withal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MOROCCO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>I will survey the inscriptions back again.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>What says this leaden casket?</span><br/>
<span id='16'>'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?</span><br/>
<span id='18'>This casket threatens. Men that hazard all</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Do it in hope of fair advantages:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>What says the silver with her virgin hue?</span><br/>
<span id='23'>'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'</span><br/>
<span id='24'>As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And weigh thy value with an even hand:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough</span><br/>
<span id='28'>May not extend so far as to the lady:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And yet to be afeard of my deserving</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Were but a weak disabling of myself.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>In graces and in qualities of breeding;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>But more than these, in love I do deserve.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Let's see once more this saying graved in gold</span><br/>
<span id='37'>'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>From the four corners of the earth they come,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now</span><br/>
<span id='43'>For princes to come view fair Portia:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar</span><br/>
<span id='46'>To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>One of these three contains her heavenly picture.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation</span><br/>
<span id='50'>To think so base a thought: it were too gross</span><br/>
<span id='51'>To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Or shall I think in silver she's immured,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?</span><br/>
<span id='54'>O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Was set in worse than gold. They have in England</span><br/>
<span id='56'>A coin that bears the figure of an angel</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>But here an angel in a golden bed</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Lies all within. Deliver me the key:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Then I am yours.</span><br/>
<p><em>He unlocks the golden casket</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>MOROCCO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>                  O hell! what have we here?</span><br/>
<span id='64'>A carrion Death, within whose empty eye</span><br/>
<span id='65'>There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='66'>All that glitters is not gold;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Often have you heard that told:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Many a man his life hath sold</span><br/>
<span id='69'>But my outside to behold:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Gilded tombs do worms enfold.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Had you been as wise as bold,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Young in limbs, in judgment old,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Your answer had not been inscroll'd:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Fare you well; your suit is cold.</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Cold, indeed; and labour lost:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart</span><br/>
<span id='78'>To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Let all of his complexion choose me so.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

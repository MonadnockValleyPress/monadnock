<h1>Henry VI, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Camp of the York in Anjou.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter YORK, WARWICK, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE, guarded, and a Shepherd</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Shepherd</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Have I sought every country far and near,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And, now it is my chance to find thee out,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I'll die with thee!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!</span><br/>
<span id='8'>I am descended of a gentler blood:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Shepherd</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>I did beget her, all the parish knows:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Her mother liveth yet, can testify</span><br/>
<span id='13'>She was the first fruit of my bachelorship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>This argues what her kind of life hath been,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Shepherd</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!</span><br/>
<span id='18'>God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And for thy sake have I shed many a tear:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Shepherd</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest</span><br/>
<span id='24'>The morn that I was wedded to her mother.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Of thy nativity! I would the milk</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?</span><br/>
<span id='33'>O, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Take her away; for she hath lived too long,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>To fill the world with vicious qualities.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>First, let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>But issued from the progeny of kings;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Virtuous and holy; chosen from above,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>By inspiration of celestial grace,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>To work exceeding miracles on earth.</span><br/>
<span id='42'>I never had to do with wicked spirits:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>But you, that are polluted with your lusts,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Because you want the grace that others have,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>You judge it straight a thing impossible</span><br/>
<span id='48'>To compass wonders but by help of devils.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been</span><br/>
<span id='50'>A virgin from her tender infancy,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Chaste and immaculate in very thought;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Ay, ay: away with her to execution!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>And hark ye, sirs; because she is a maid,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Spare for no faggots, let there be enow:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>That so her torture may be shortened.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>That warranteth by law to be thy privilege.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>I am with child, ye bloody homicides:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Murder not then the fruit within my womb,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Although ye hale me to a violent death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Now heaven forfend! the holy maid with child!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Is all your strict preciseness come to this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>She and the Dauphin have been juggling:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>I did imagine what would be her refuge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Well, go to; we'll have no bastards live;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Especially since Charles must father it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>You are deceived; my child is none of his:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Alencon! that notorious Machiavel!</span><br/>
<span id='75'>It dies, an if it had a thousand lives.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>O, give me leave, I have deluded you:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>'Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>But Reignier, king of Naples, that prevail'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>A married man! that's most intolerable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not well,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>There were so many, whom she may accuse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>It's sign she hath been liberal and free.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Then lead me hence; with whom I leave my curse:</span><br/>
<span id='87'>May never glorious sun reflex his beams</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Upon the country where you make abode;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>But darkness and the gloomy shade of death</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Environ you, till mischief and despair</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit, guarded</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Thou foul accursed minister of hell!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER, attended</em></p>
<span id='94'>CARDINAL</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>OF WINCHESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Lord regent, I do greet your excellence</span><br/>
<span id='96'>With letters of commission from the king.</span><br/>
<span id='97'>For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Have earnestly implored a general peace</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And here at hand the Dauphin and his train</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Approacheth, to confer about some matter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'> Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?</span><br/>
<span id='104'>After the slaughter of so many peers,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>So many captains, gentlemen and soldiers,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>That in this quarrel have been overthrown</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Have we not lost most part of all the towns,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>By treason, falsehood and by treachery,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Our great progenitors had conquered?</span><br/>
<span id='112'>O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief</span><br/>
<span id='113'>The utter loss of all the realm of France.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>It shall be with such strict and severe covenants</span><br/>
<span id='116'>As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BASTARD OF ORLEANS, REIGNIER, and others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed</span><br/>
<span id='118'>That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>We come to be informed by yourselves</span><br/>
<span id='120'>What the conditions of that league must be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Speak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes</span><br/>
<span id='122'>The hollow passage of my poison'd voice,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>By sight of these our baleful enemies.</span><br/>
<span id='124'>CARDINAL</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>OF WINCHESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:</span><br/>
<span id='126'>That, in regard King Henry gives consent,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Of mere compassion and of lenity,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>To ease your country of distressful war,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>You shall become true liegemen to his crown:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear</span><br/>
<span id='132'>To pay him tribute, submit thyself,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And still enjoy thy regal dignity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>ALENCON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Must he be then as shadow of himself?</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Adorn his temples with a coronet,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>And yet, in substance and authority,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Retain but privilege of a private man?</span><br/>
<span id='139'>This proffer is absurd and reasonless.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>'Tis known already that I am possess'd</span><br/>
<span id='141'>With more than half the Gallian territories,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>And therein reverenced for their lawful king:</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Detract so much from that prerogative,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?</span><br/>
<span id='146'>No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep</span><br/>
<span id='147'>That which I have than, coveting for more,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Be cast from possibility of all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Used intercession to obtain a league,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>And, now the matter grows to compromise,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison?</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Either accept the title thou usurp'st,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Of benefit proceeding from our king</span><br/>
<span id='155'>And not of any challenge of desert,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>REIGNIER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>My lord, you do not well in obstinacy</span><br/>
<span id='158'>To cavil in the course of this contract:</span><br/>
<span id='159'>If once it be neglected, ten to one</span><br/>
<span id='160'>We shall not find like opportunity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>ALENCON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>To say the truth, it is your policy</span><br/>
<span id='162'>To save your subjects from such massacre</span><br/>
<span id='163'>And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen</span><br/>
<span id='164'>By our proceeding in hostility;</span><br/>
<span id='165'>And therefore take this compact of a truce,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Although you break it when your pleasure serves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>How say'st thou, Charles? shall our condition stand?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>It shall;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Only reserved, you claim no interest</span><br/>
<span id='170'>In any of our towns of garrison.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Then swear allegiance to his majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>As thou art knight, never to disobey</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Nor be rebellious to the crown of England,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.</span><br/>
<span id='175'>So, now dismiss your army when ye please:</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>For here we entertain a solemn peace.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

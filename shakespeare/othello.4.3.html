<span id='speech2'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LODOVICO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Your honour is most welcome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Will you walk, sir?</span><br/>
<span id='6'>O,&mdash;Desdemona,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>My lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned</span><br/>
<span id='9'>forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.</span><br/>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>I will, my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt OTHELLO, LODOVICO, and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>He says he will return incontinent:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>He hath commanded me to go to bed,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And bade me to dismiss you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Dismiss me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>We must not now displease him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>I would you had never seen him!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>So would not I: my love doth so approve him,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Prithee, unpin me,&mdash;have grace and favour in them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!</span><br/>
<span id='25'>If I do die before thee prithee, shroud me</span><br/>
<span id='26'>In one of those same sheets.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Come, come you talk.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>She was in love, and he she loved proved mad</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'</span><br/>
<span id='31'>An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And she died singing it: that song to-night</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Will not go from my mind; I have much to do,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>But to go hang my head all at one side,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Shall I go fetch your night-gown?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>No, unpin me here.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>This Lodovico is a proper man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>A very handsome man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>He speaks well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot</span><br/>
<span id='42'>to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>[Singing]  The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Sing all a green willow:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Sing willow, willow, willow:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Sing willow, willow, willow;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Lay by these:&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>Singing</em></p>
<span id='51'>Sing willow, willow, willow;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>Singing</em></p>
<span id='53'>Sing all a green willow must be my garland.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Nay, that's not next.&mdash;Hark! who is't that knocks?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>It's the wind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>[Singing]  I call'd my love false love; but what</span><br/>
<span id='58'>said he then?</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Sing willow, willow, willow:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men!</span><br/>
<span id='61'>So, get thee gone; good night. Mine eyes do itch;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Doth that bode weeping?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>'Tis neither here nor there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Dost thou in conscience think,&mdash;tell me, Emilia,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>That there be women do abuse their husbands</span><br/>
<span id='67'>In such gross kind?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>There be some such, no question.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Why, would not you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>No, by this heavenly light!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Nor I neither by this heavenly light;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>I might do't as well i' the dark.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>The world's a huge thing: it is a great price</span><br/>
<span id='76'>For a small vice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>In troth, I think thou wouldst not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had</span><br/>
<span id='79'>done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a</span><br/>
<span id='80'>joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for</span><br/>
<span id='81'>gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty</span><br/>
<span id='82'>exhibition; but for the whole world,&mdash;why, who would</span><br/>
<span id='83'>not make her husband a cuckold to make him a</span><br/>
<span id='84'>monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong</span><br/>
<span id='86'>For the whole world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and</span><br/>
<span id='88'>having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your</span><br/>
<span id='89'>own world, and you might quickly make it right.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>I do not think there is any such woman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would</span><br/>
<span id='92'>store the world they played for.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>But I do think it is their husbands' faults</span><br/>
<span id='94'>If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And pour our treasures into foreign laps,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Or else break out in peevish jealousies,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Or scant our former having in despite;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell</span><br/>
<span id='102'>And have their palates both for sweet and sour,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>As husbands have. What is it that they do</span><br/>
<span id='104'>When they change us for others? Is it sport?</span><br/>
<span id='105'>I think it is: and doth affection breed it?</span><br/>
<span id='106'>I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?</span><br/>
<span id='107'>It is so too: and have not we affections,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Then let them use us well: else let them know,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

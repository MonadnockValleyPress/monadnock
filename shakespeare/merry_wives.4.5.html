<em>Enter Host and SIMPLE</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>What wouldst thou have, boor? what: thick-skin?</span><br/>
<span id='2'>speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick, snap.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SIMPLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff</span><br/>
<span id='4'>from Master Slender.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>There's his chamber, his house, his castle, his</span><br/>
<span id='6'>standing-bed and truckle-bed; 'tis painted about</span><br/>
<span id='7'>with the story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go</span><br/>
<span id='8'>knock and call; he'll speak like an Anthropophaginian</span><br/>
<span id='9'>unto thee: knock, I say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SIMPLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>There's an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into his</span><br/>
<span id='11'>chamber: I'll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come</span><br/>
<span id='12'>down; I come to speak with her, indeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Ha! a fat woman! the knight may be robbed: I'll</span><br/>
<span id='14'>call. Bully knight! bully Sir John! speak from</span><br/>
<span id='15'>thy lungs military: art thou there? it is thine</span><br/>
<span id='16'>host, thine Ephesian, calls.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>[Above]  How now, mine host!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Here's a Bohemian-Tartar tarries the coming down of</span><br/>
<span id='19'>thy fat woman. Let her descend, bully, let her</span><br/>
<span id='20'>descend; my chambers are honourable: fie! privacy?</span><br/>
<span id='21'>fie!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter FALSTAFF</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with</span><br/>
<span id='23'>me;  but she's gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SIMPLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Brentford?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Ay, marry, was it, mussel-shell: what would you with her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SIMPLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>My master, sir, Master Slender, sent to her, seeing</span><br/>
<span id='28'>her go through the streets, to know, sir, whether</span><br/>
<span id='29'>one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a chain, had the</span><br/>
<span id='30'>chain or no.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>I spake with the old woman about it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SIMPLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>And what says she, I pray, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Marry, she says that the very same man that</span><br/>
<span id='34'>beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of</span><br/>
<span id='35'>it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SIMPLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>I would I could have spoken with the woman herself;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>I had other things to have spoken with her too from</span><br/>
<span id='38'>him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>What are they? let us know.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Ay, come; quick.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SIMPLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>I may not conceal them, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Conceal them, or thou diest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SIMPLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress Anne</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Page; to know if it were my master's fortune to</span><br/>
<span id='45'>have her or no.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>'Tis, 'tis his fortune.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SIMPLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>What, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>SIMPLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>May I be bold to say so, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Ay, sir; like who more bold.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>SIMPLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>I thank your worship: I shall make my master glad</span><br/>
<span id='52'>with these tidings.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was</span><br/>
<span id='54'>there a wise woman with thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath taught</span><br/>
<span id='56'>me more wit than ever I learned before in my life;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>and I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for</span><br/>
<span id='58'>my learning.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BARDOLPH</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Out, alas, sir! cozenage, mere cozenage!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Where be my horses? speak well of them, varletto.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I came</span><br/>
<span id='62'>beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of</span><br/>
<span id='63'>them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>They are gone but to meet the duke, villain: do not</span><br/>
<span id='66'>say they be fled; Germans are honest men.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SIR HUGH EVANS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>SIR HUGH EVANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Where is mine host?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>What is the matter, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>SIR HUGH EVANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Have a care of your entertainments: there is a</span><br/>
<span id='70'>friend of mine come to town tells me there is three</span><br/>
<span id='71'>cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Readins, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and</span><br/>
<span id='73'>money. I tell you for good will, look you: you</span><br/>
<span id='74'>are wise and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks, and</span><br/>
<span id='75'>'tis not convenient you should be cozened. Fare you well.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter DOCTOR CAIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DOCTOR CAIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Vere is mine host de Jarteer?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Here, master doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DOCTOR CAIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>I cannot tell vat is dat: but it is tell-a me dat</span><br/>
<span id='79'>you make grand preparation for a duke de Jamany: by</span><br/>
<span id='80'>my trot, dere is no duke dat the court is know to</span><br/>
<span id='81'>come. I tell you for good vill: adieu.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Hue and cry, villain, go! Assist me, knight. I am</span><br/>
<span id='83'>undone! Fly, run, hue and cry, villain! I am undone!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Host and BARDOLPH</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>I would all the world might be cozened; for I have</span><br/>
<span id='85'>been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to</span><br/>
<span id='86'>the ear of the court, how I have been transformed</span><br/>
<span id='87'>and how my transformation hath been washed and</span><br/>
<span id='88'>cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by</span><br/>
<span id='89'>drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant</span><br/>
<span id='90'>they would whip me with their fine wits till I were</span><br/>
<span id='91'>as crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered</span><br/>
<span id='92'>since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my</span><br/>
<span id='93'>wind were but long enough to say my prayers, I would repent.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY</em></p>
<span id='94'>Now, whence come you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>From the two parties, forsooth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>The devil take one party and his dam the other! and</span><br/>
<span id='97'>so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more</span><br/>
<span id='98'>for their sakes, more than the villanous inconstancy</span><br/>
<span id='99'>of man's disposition is able to bear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>is beaten black and blue, that you cannot see a</span><br/>
<span id='103'>white spot about her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was</span><br/>
<span id='105'>beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Brentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>delivered me, the knave constable had set me i' the</span><br/>
<span id='110'>stocks, i' the common stocks, for a witch.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber: you</span><br/>
<span id='112'>shall hear how things go; and, I warrant, to your</span><br/>
<span id='113'>content. Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good</span><br/>
<span id='114'>hearts, what ado here is to bring you together!</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that</span><br/>
<span id='116'>you are so crossed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Come up into my chamber.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

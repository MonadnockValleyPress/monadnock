<h1>The Merchant of Venice</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene IX</H3>
<h4>Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter NERISSA with a Servitor</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And comes to his election presently.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON, PORTIA, and their trains</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>You must be gone from hence immediately.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ARRAGON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>First, never to unfold to any one</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Of the right casket, never in my life</span><br/>
<span id='13'>To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>If I do fail in fortune of my choice,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Immediately to leave you and be gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>To these injunctions every one doth swear</span><br/>
<span id='17'>That comes to hazard for my worthless self.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ARRAGON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>And so have I address'd me. Fortune now</span><br/>
<span id='19'>To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.</span><br/>
<span id='20'>'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'</span><br/>
<span id='21'>You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'</span><br/>
<span id='24'>What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant</span><br/>
<span id='25'>By the fool multitude, that choose by show,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Builds in the weather on the outward wall,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Even in the force and road of casualty.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>I will not choose what many men desire,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Because I will not jump with common spirits</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And well said too; for who shall go about</span><br/>
<span id='37'>To cozen fortune and be honourable</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To wear an undeserved dignity.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>O, that estates, degrees and offices</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!</span><br/>
<span id='43'>How many then should cover that stand bare!</span><br/>
<span id='44'>How many be commanded that command!</span><br/>
<span id='45'>How much low peasantry would then be glean'd</span><br/>
<span id='46'>From the true seed of honour! and how much honour</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times</span><br/>
<span id='48'>To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'</span><br/>
<span id='50'>I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And instantly unlock my fortunes here.</span><br/>
<p><em>He opens the silver casket</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Too long a pause for that which you find there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ARRAGON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>How much unlike art thou to Portia!</span><br/>
<span id='56'>How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!</span><br/>
<span id='57'>'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>To offend, and judge, are distinct offices</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And of opposed natures.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ARRAGON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>What is here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='63'>The fire seven times tried this:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Seven times tried that judgment is,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>That did never choose amiss.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Some there be that shadows kiss;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Such have but a shadow's bliss:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>There be fools alive, I wis,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Silver'd o'er; and so was this.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Take what wife you will to bed,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>I will ever be your head:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>So be gone: you are sped.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Still more fool I shall appear</span><br/>
<span id='74'>By the time I linger here</span><br/>
<span id='75'>With one fool's head I came to woo,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>But I go away with two.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Patiently to bear my wroth.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Arragon and train</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Thus hath the candle singed the moth.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>The ancient saying is no heresy,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Servant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Where is my lady?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>                  Here: what would my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Madam, there is alighted at your gate</span><br/>
<span id='88'>A young Venetian, one that comes before</span><br/>
<span id='89'>To signify the approaching of his lord;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen</span><br/>
<span id='93'>So likely an ambassador of love:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>A day in April never came so sweet,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>To show how costly summer was at hand,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

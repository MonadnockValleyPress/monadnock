<h1>Antony and Cleopatra</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Alexandria. A room in the monument.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRAS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>My desolation does begin to make</span><br/>
<span id='2'>A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>A minister of her will: and it is great</span><br/>
<span id='5'>To do that thing that ends all other deeds;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS and Soldiers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PROCULEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And bids thee study on what fair demands</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>What's thy name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PROCULEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>My name is Proculeius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Antony</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but</span><br/>
<span id='16'>I do not greatly care to be deceived,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>That have no use for trusting. If your master</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>That majesty, to keep decorum, must</span><br/>
<span id='20'>No less beg than a kingdom: if he please</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>He gives me so much of mine own, as I</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Will kneel to him with thanks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PROCULEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Be of good cheer;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Make your full reference freely to my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Who is so full of grace, that it flows over</span><br/>
<span id='28'>On all that need: let me report to him</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Your sweet dependency; and you shall find</span><br/>
<span id='30'>A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Where he for grace is kneel'd to.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Pray you, tell him</span><br/>
<span id='33'>I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him</span><br/>
<span id='34'>The greatness he has got. I hourly learn</span><br/>
<span id='35'>A doctrine of obedience; and would gladly</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Look him i' the face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PROCULEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>This I'll report, dear lady.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Of him that caused it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GALLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>You see how easily she may be surprised:</span><br/>
<p><em>Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the  monument by a ladder placed against a window, and,  having descended, come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the Guard unbar and open the gates</em></p>
<p><em>To PROCULEIUS and the Guard</em></p>
<span id='41'>Guard her till Caesar come.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>IRAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Royal queen!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CHARMIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Quick, quick, good hands.</span><br/>
<p><em>Drawing a dagger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PROCULEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Hold, worthy lady, hold:</span><br/>
<p><em>Seizes and disarms her</em></p>
<span id='46'>Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Relieved, but not betray'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>What, of death too,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>That rids our dogs of languish?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PROCULEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Cleopatra,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Do not abuse my master's bounty by</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The undoing of yourself: let the world see</span><br/>
<span id='53'>His nobleness well acted, which your death</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Will never let come forth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Where art thou, death?</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Worthy many babes and beggars!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PROCULEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>O, temperance, lady!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>If idle talk will once be necessary,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Nor once be chastised with the sober eye</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And show me to the shouting varletry</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Blow me into abhorring! rather make</span><br/>
<span id='71'>My country's high pyramides my gibbet,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And hang me up in chains!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PROCULEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>You do extend</span><br/>
<span id='74'>These thoughts of horror further than you shall</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Find cause in Caesar.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DOLABELLA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DOLABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Proculeius,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>I'll take her to my guard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PROCULEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>So, Dolabella,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>It shall content me best: be gentle to her.</span><br/>
<p><em>To CLEOPATRA</em></p>
<span id='82'>To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>If you'll employ me to him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Say, I would die.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DOLABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Most noble empress, you have heard of me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>I cannot tell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DOLABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>                  Assuredly you know me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Is't not your trick?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DOLABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>I understand not, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>O, such another sleep, that I might see</span><br/>
<span id='94'>But such another man!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DOLABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>If it might please ye,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck</span><br/>
<span id='97'>A sun and moon, which kept their course,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>and lighted</span><br/>
<span id='99'>The little O, the earth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DOLABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Most sovereign creature,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Crested the world: his voice was propertied</span><br/>
<span id='103'>As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas</span><br/>
<span id='107'>That grew the more by reaping: his delights</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above</span><br/>
<span id='109'>The element they lived in: in his livery</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were</span><br/>
<span id='111'>As plates dropp'd from his pocket.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DOLABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Cleopatra!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Think you there was, or might be, such a man</span><br/>
<span id='114'>As this I dream'd of?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DOLABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Gentle madam, no.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.</span><br/>
<span id='117'>But, if there be, or ever were, one such,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff</span><br/>
<span id='119'>To vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine</span><br/>
<span id='120'>An Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Condemning shadows quite.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DOLABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Hear me, good madam.</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it</span><br/>
<span id='124'>As answering to the weight: would I might never</span><br/>
<span id='125'>O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites</span><br/>
<span id='127'>My very heart at root.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>I thank you, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Know you what Caesar means to do with me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DOLABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Nay, pray you, sir,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DOLABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Though he be honourable,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>He'll lead me, then, in triumph?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DOLABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Madam, he will; I know't.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish, and shout within, 'Make way there: Octavius Caesar!'</em></p>
<p><em>Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MECAENAS, SELEUCUS, and others of his Train</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>

<span id='135'>Which is the Queen of Egypt?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DOLABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>It is the emperor, madam.</span><br/>
<p><em>CLEOPATRA kneels</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Arise, you shall not kneel:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Sir, the gods</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Will have it thus; my master and my lord</span><br/>
<span id='141'>I must obey.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>                  Take to you no hard thoughts:</span><br/>
<span id='143'>The record of what injuries you did us,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Though written in our flesh, we shall remember</span><br/>
<span id='145'>As things but done by chance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Sole sir o' the world,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>I cannot project mine own cause so well</span><br/>
<span id='148'>To make it clear; but do confess I have</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Been laden with like frailties which before</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Have often shamed our sex.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Cleopatra, know,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>We will extenuate rather than enforce:</span><br/>
<span id='153'>If you apply yourself to our intents,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find</span><br/>
<span id='155'>A benefit in this change; but if you seek</span><br/>
<span id='156'>To lay on me a cruelty, by taking</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Of my good purposes, and put your children</span><br/>
<span id='159'>To that destruction which I'll guard them from,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>SELEUCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Here, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Upon his peril, that I have reserved</span><br/>
<span id='171'>To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>SELEUCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Madam,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Speak that which is not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<span id='175'>What have I kept back?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>SELEUCUS</strong></span>

<span id='177'>Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Your wisdom in the deed.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='179'>See, Caesar! O, behold,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;</span><br/>
<span id='181'>And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.</span><br/>
<span id='182'>The ingratitude of this Seleucus does</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>

<span id='192'>To one so meek, that mine own servant should</span><br/>

<span id='195'>That I some lady trifles have reserved,</span><br/>

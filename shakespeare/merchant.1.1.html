<h1>The Merchant of Venice</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Venice. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>It wearies me; you say it wearies you;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I am to learn;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>That I have much ado to know myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SALARINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Your mind is tossing on the ocean;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>There, where your argosies with portly sail,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Do overpeer the petty traffickers,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>That curtsy to them, do them reverence,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>As they fly by them with their woven wings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SALANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The better part of my affections would</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And every object that might make me fear</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Would make me sad.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SALARINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>                  My wind cooling my broth</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Would blow me to an ague, when I thought</span><br/>
<span id='25'>What harm a wind too great at sea might do.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>But I should think of shallows and of flats,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs</span><br/>
<span id='30'>To kiss her burial. Should I go to church</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And see the holy edifice of stone,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Would scatter all her spices on the stream,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And, in a word, but even now worth this,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</span><br/>
<span id='38'>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</span><br/>
<span id='39'>That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?</span><br/>
<span id='40'>But tell not me; I know, Antonio</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Upon the fortune of this present year:</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SALARINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Why, then you are in love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Fie, fie!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SALARINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy</span><br/>
<span id='51'>For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Some that will evermore peep through their eyes</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And other of such vinegar aspect</span><br/>
<span id='57'>That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SALANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>We leave you now with better company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SALARINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>If worthier friends had not prevented me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Your worth is very dear in my regard.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>I take it, your own business calls on you</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And you embrace the occasion to depart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SALARINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Good morrow, my good lords.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?</span><br/>
<span id='69'>You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SALARINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Salarino and Salanio</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>I will not fail you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>You look not well, Signior Antonio;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>You have too much respect upon the world:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>They lose it that do buy it with much care:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Believe me, you are marvellously changed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>A stage where every man must play a part,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And mine a sad one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Let me play the fool:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And let my liver rather heat with wine</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice</span><br/>
<span id='89'>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>I love thee, and it is my love that speaks&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>There are a sort of men whose visages</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And do a wilful stillness entertain,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'</span><br/>
<span id='98'>O my Antonio, I do know of these</span><br/>
<span id='99'>That therefore only are reputed wise</span><br/>
<span id='100'>For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.</span><br/>
<span id='103'>I'll tell thee more of this another time:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>But fish not, with this melancholy bait,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>I'll end my exhortation after dinner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:</span><br/>
<span id='109'>I must be one of these same dumb wise men,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>For Gratiano never lets me speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Well, keep me company but two years more,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable</span><br/>
<span id='115'>In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Is that any thing now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more</span><br/>
<span id='118'>than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two</span><br/>
<span id='119'>grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you</span><br/>
<span id='120'>shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you</span><br/>
<span id='121'>have them, they are not worth the search.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Well, tell me now what lady is the same</span><br/>
<span id='123'>To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>That you to-day promised to tell me of?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>How much I have disabled mine estate,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>By something showing a more swelling port</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Than my faint means would grant continuance:</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Nor do I now make moan to be abridged</span><br/>
<span id='130'>From such a noble rate; but my chief care</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Is to come fairly off from the great debts</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Wherein my time something too prodigal</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>I owe the most, in money and in love,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And from your love I have a warranty</span><br/>
<span id='136'>To unburden all my plots and purposes</span><br/>
<span id='137'>How to get clear of all the debts I owe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>And if it stand, as you yourself still do,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Within the eye of honour, be assured,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>My purse, my person, my extremest means,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>I shot his fellow of the self-same flight</span><br/>
<span id='145'>The self-same way with more advised watch,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>To find the other forth, and by adventuring both</span><br/>
<span id='147'>I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Because what follows is pure innocence.</span><br/>
<span id='149'>I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>That which I owe is lost; but if you please</span><br/>
<span id='151'>To shoot another arrow that self way</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>As I will watch the aim, or to find both</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Or bring your latter hazard back again</span><br/>
<span id='155'>And thankfully rest debtor for the first.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>You know me well, and herein spend but time</span><br/>
<span id='157'>To wind about my love with circumstance;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>And out of doubt you do me now more wrong</span><br/>
<span id='159'>In making question of my uttermost</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Than if you had made waste of all I have:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Then do but say to me what I should do</span><br/>
<span id='162'>That in your knowledge may by me be done,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>In Belmont is a lady richly left;</span><br/>
<span id='165'>And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes</span><br/>
<span id='167'>I did receive fair speechless messages:</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued</span><br/>
<span id='169'>To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>For the four winds blow in from every coast</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>And many Jasons come in quest of her.</span><br/>
<span id='176'>O my Antonio, had I but the means</span><br/>
<span id='177'>To hold a rival place with one of them,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>I have a mind presages me such thrift,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>That I should questionless be fortunate!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Neither have I money nor commodity</span><br/>
<span id='182'>To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Try what my credit can in Venice do:</span><br/>
<span id='184'>That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Go, presently inquire, and so will I,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Where money is, and I no question make</span><br/>
<span id='188'>To have it of my trust or for my sake.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

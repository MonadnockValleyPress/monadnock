<span id='speech1'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>What, John Rugby! I pray thee, go to the casement,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>and see if you can see my master, Master Doctor</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Caius, coming. If he do, i' faith, and find any</span><br/>
<span id='4'>body in the house, here will be an old abusing of</span><br/>
<span id='5'>God's patience and the king's English.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>RUGBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>I'll go watch.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Go; and we'll have a posset for't soon at night, in</span><br/>
<span id='8'>faith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit RUGBY</em></p>
<span id='9'>An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant</span><br/>
<span id='10'>shall come in house withal, and, I warrant you, no</span><br/>
<span id='11'>tell-tale nor no breed-bate: his worst fault is,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>that he is given to prayer; he is something peevish</span><br/>
<span id='13'>that way: but nobody but has his fault; but let</span><br/>
<span id='14'>that pass. Peter Simple, you say your name is?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SIMPLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Ay, for fault of a better.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Ay, forsooth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Does he not wear a great round beard, like a</span><br/>
<span id='19'>glover's paring-knife?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SIMPLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>No, forsooth: he hath but a little wee face, with a</span><br/>
<span id='21'>little yellow beard, a Cain-coloured beard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>A softly-sprighted man, is he not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SIMPLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man of his hands</span><br/>
<span id='24'>as any is between this and his head; he hath fought</span><br/>
<span id='25'>with a warrener.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>How say you? O, I should remember him: does he not</span><br/>
<span id='27'>hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SIMPLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Yes, indeed, does he.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune! Tell</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Master Parson Evans I will do what I can for your</span><br/>
<span id='31'>master: Anne is a good girl, and I wish&mdash;</span><br/>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>

<span id='79'>[Aside to SIMPLE]  I am glad he is so quiet: if he</span><br/>

<span id='82'>man, I'll do you your master what good I can: and</span><br/>
<span id='83'>the very yea and the no is, the French doctor, my</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='115'>You shall have An fool's-head of your own. No, I</span><br/>
<span id='116'>know Anne's mind for that: never a woman in Windsor</span><br/>

<span id='124'>In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and</span><br/>
<span id='125'>gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you</span><br/>

<span id='133'>Well, thereby hangs a tale: good faith, it is such</span><br/>
<span id='134'>another Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever</span><br/>
<span id='135'>broke bread: we had an hour's talk of that wart. I</span><br/>
<span id='136'>shall never laugh but in that maid's company! But</span><br/>
<span id='137'>indeed she is given too much to allicholy and</span><br/>
<span id='138'>musing: but for you&mdash;well, go to.</span><br/>

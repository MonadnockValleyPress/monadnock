<span id='speech1'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Come, Marcus; come, kinsmen; this is the way.</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Sir boy, now let me see your archery;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Terras Astraea reliquit:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Be you remember'd, Marcus, she's gone, she's fled.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Go sound the ocean, and cast your nets;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Happily you may catch her in the sea;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Yet there's as little justice as at land:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And pierce the inmost centre of the earth:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Then, when you come to Pluto's region,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>I pray you, deliver him this petition;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And that it comes from old Andronicus,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Ah, Rome! Well, well; I made thee miserable</span><br/>
<span id='19'>What time I threw the people's suffrages</span><br/>
<span id='20'>On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>This wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>O Publius, is not this a heavy case,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>To see thy noble uncle thus distract?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PUBLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Therefore, my lord, it highly us concerns</span><br/>
<span id='28'>By day and night to attend him carefully,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And feed his humour kindly as we may,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Till time beget some careful remedy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Join with the Goths; and with revengeful war</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Publius, how now! how now, my masters!</span><br/>
<span id='36'>What, have you met with her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PUBLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Marry, for Justice, she is so employ'd,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>So that perforce you must needs stay a time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>I'll dive into the burning lake below,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we</span><br/>
<span id='46'>No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And, sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>We will solicit heaven and move the gods</span><br/>
<span id='51'>To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus;</span><br/>
<p><em>He gives them the arrows</em></p>
<span id='53'>'Ad Jovem,' that's for you: here, 'Ad Apollinem:'</span><br/>
<span id='54'>'Ad Martem,' that's for myself:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Here, boy, to Pallas: here, to Mercury:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>To Saturn, Caius, not to Saturnine;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>You were as good to shoot against the wind.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>To it, boy! Marcus, loose when I bid.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Of my word, I have written to effect;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>There's not a god left unsolicited.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>We will afflict the emperor in his pride.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Now, masters, draw.</span><br/>
<p><em>They shoot</em></p>
<span id='64'>O, well said, Lucius!</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Good boy, in Virgo's lap; give it Pallas.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Your letter is with Jupiter by this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Ha, ha!</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?</span><br/>
<span id='70'>See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>The Bull, being gall'd, gave Aries such a knock</span><br/>
<span id='73'>That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And who should find them but the empress' villain?</span><br/>
<span id='75'>She laugh'd, and told the Moor he should not choose</span><br/>
<span id='76'>But give them to his master for a present.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Why, there it goes: God give his lordship joy!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Clown, with a basket, and two pigeons in it</em></p>
<span id='78'>News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Sirrah, what tidings? have you any letters?</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Shall I have justice? what says Jupiter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>O, the gibbet-maker! he says that he hath taken</span><br/>
<span id='82'>them down again, for the man must not be hanged till</span><br/>
<span id='83'>the next week.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him</span><br/>
<span id='86'>in all my life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Why, didst thou not come from heaven?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>From heaven! alas, sir, I never came there: God</span><br/>
<span id='91'>forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my</span><br/>
<span id='92'>young days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the</span><br/>
<span id='93'>tribunal plebs, to take up a matter of brawl</span><br/>
<span id='94'>betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for</span><br/>
<span id='96'>your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to</span><br/>
<span id='97'>the emperor from you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor</span><br/>
<span id='99'>with a grace?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Sirrah, come hither: make no more ado,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>But give your pigeons to the emperor:</span><br/>
<span id='103'>By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Hold, hold; meanwhile here's money for thy charges.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Give me pen and ink. Sirrah, can you with a grace</span><br/>
<span id='106'>deliver a supplication?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Ay, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Then here is a supplication for you. And when you</span><br/>
<span id='109'>come to him, at the first approach you must kneel,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>then kiss his foot, then deliver up your pigeons, and</span><br/>
<span id='111'>then look for your reward. I'll be at hand, sir; see</span><br/>
<span id='112'>you do it bravely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>I warrant you, sir, let me alone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Sirrah, hast thou a knife? come, let me see it.</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant.</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And when thou hast given it the emperor,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>God be with you, sir; I will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Come, Marcus, let us go. Publius, follow me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Cymbeline</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</h3>
<h4>A room in Cymbeline's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And question'dst every sail: if he should write</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And not have it, 'twere a paper lost,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>As offer'd mercy is. What was the last</span><br/>
<span id='5'>That he spake to thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>It was his queen, his queen!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Then waved his handkerchief?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>And kiss'd it, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And that was all?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>                  No, madam; for so long</span><br/>
<span id='12'>As he could make me with this eye or ear</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Distinguish him from others, he did keep</span><br/>
<span id='14'>The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>How swift his ship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Thou shouldst have made him</span><br/>
<span id='19'>As little as a crow, or less, ere left</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To after-eye him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>                  Madam, so I did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To look upon him, till the diminution</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from</span><br/>
<span id='26'>The smallness of a gnat to air, and then</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>When shall we hear from him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Be assured, madam,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>With his next vantage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>I did not take my leave of him, but had</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him</span><br/>
<span id='33'>How I would think on him at certain hours</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear</span><br/>
<span id='35'>The shes of Italy should not betray</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>To encounter me with orisons, for then</span><br/>
<span id='39'>I am in heaven for him; or ere I could</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Give him that parting kiss which I had set</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And like the tyrannous breathing of the north</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Shakes all our buds from growing.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Lady</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>The queen, madam,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Desires your highness' company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I will attend the queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Madam, I shall.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

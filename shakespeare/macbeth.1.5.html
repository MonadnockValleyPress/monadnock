<blockquote>
<em>Enter LADY MACBETH, reading a letter</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>'They met me in the day of success: and I have</span><br/>
<span id='2'>learned by the perfectest report, they have more in</span><br/>
<span id='3'>them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire</span><br/>
<span id='4'>to question them further, they made themselves air,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in</span><br/>
<span id='6'>the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who</span><br/>
<span id='7'>all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred</span><br/>
<span id='9'>me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that</span><br/>
<span id='10'>shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver</span><br/>
<span id='11'>thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou</span><br/>
<span id='12'>mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being</span><br/>
<span id='13'>ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it</span><br/>
<span id='14'>to thy heart, and farewell.'</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be</span><br/>
<span id='16'>What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>It is too full o' the milk of human kindness</span><br/>
<span id='18'>To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Art not without ambition, but without</span><br/>
<span id='20'>The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And that which rather thou dost fear to do</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And chastise with the valour of my tongue</span><br/>
<span id='28'>All that impedes thee from the golden round,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem</span><br/>
<span id='30'>To have thee crown'd withal.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
<span id='31'>What is your tidings?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>The king comes here to-night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Thou'rt mad to say it:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Would have inform'd for preparation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>One of my fellows had the speed of him,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Than would make up his message.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Give him tending;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>He brings great news.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Messenger</em></p>
<span id='42'>The raven himself is hoarse</span><br/>
<span id='43'>That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Under my battlements. Come, you spirits</span><br/>
<span id='45'>That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Stop up the access and passage to remorse,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>That no compunctious visitings of nature</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between</span><br/>
<span id='51'>The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Wherever in your sightless substances</span><br/>
<span id='54'>You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>To cry 'Hold, hold!'</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MACBETH</em></p>
<span id='59'>Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Thy letters have transported me beyond</span><br/>
<span id='62'>This ignorant present, and I feel now</span><br/>
<span id='63'>The future in the instant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>My dearest love,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Duncan comes here to-night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>And when goes hence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>To-morrow, as he purposes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>O, never</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Shall sun that morrow see!</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Your face, my thane, is as a book where men</span><br/>
<span id='71'>May read strange matters. To beguile the time,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>But be the serpent under't. He that's coming</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Must be provided for: and you shall put</span><br/>
<span id='76'>This night's great business into my dispatch;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Which shall to all our nights and days to come</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>We will speak further.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Only look up clear;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>To alter favour ever is to fear:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Leave all the rest to me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Are the knights ready to begin the triumph?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>They are, my liege;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And stay your coming to present themselves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Return them, we are ready; and our daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>In honour of whose birth these triumphs are,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Sits here, like beauty's child, whom nature gat</span><br/>
<span id='9'>For men to see, and seeing wonder at.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit a Lord</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express</span><br/>
<span id='11'>My commendations great, whose merit's less.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>It's fit it should be so; for princes are</span><br/>
<span id='13'>A model which heaven makes like to itself:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>As jewels lose their glory if neglected,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>So princes their renowns if not respected.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>'Tis now your honour, daughter, to explain</span><br/>
<span id='17'>The labour of each knight in his device.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Which, to preserve mine honour, I'll perform.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Knight; he passes over, and his Squire presents his shield to the Princess</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Who is the first that doth prefer himself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>A knight of Sparta, my renowned father;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And the device he bears upon his shield</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun</span><br/>
<span id='23'>The word, 'Lux tua vita mihi.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>He loves you well that holds his life of you.</span><br/>
<p><em>The Second Knight passes over</em></p>
<span id='25'>Who is the second that presents himself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>A prince of Macedon, my royal father;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And the device he bears upon his shield</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>The motto thus, in Spanish, 'Piu por dulzura que por fuerza.'</span><br/>
<p><em>The Third Knight passes over</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>And what's the third?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>The third of Antioch;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And his device, a wreath of chivalry;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>The word, 'Me pompae provexit apex.'</span><br/>
<p><em>The Fourth Knight passes over</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>What is the fourth?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>A burning torch that's turned upside down;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>The word, 'Quod me alit, me extinguit.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Which can as well inflame as it can kill.</span><br/>
<p><em>The Fifth Knight passes over</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>The fifth, an hand environed with clouds,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>The motto thus, 'Sic spectanda fides.'</span><br/>
<p><em>The Sixth Knight, PERICLES, passes over</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>And what's</span><br/>
<span id='43'>The sixth and last, the which the knight himself</span><br/>
<span id='44'>With such a graceful courtesy deliver'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>He seems to be a stranger; but his present is</span><br/>
<span id='46'>A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>The motto, 'In hac spe vivo.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>A pretty moral;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>From the dejected state wherein he is,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>He had need mean better than his outward show</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Can any way speak in his just commend;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>For by his rusty outside he appears</span><br/>
<span id='54'>To have practised more the whipstock than the lance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>He well may be a stranger, for he comes</span><br/>
<span id='56'>To an honour'd triumph strangely furnished.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Third Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>And on set purpose let his armour rust</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Until this day, to scour it in the dust.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan</span><br/>
<span id='60'>The outward habit by the inward man.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>But stay, the knights are coming: we will withdraw</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Into the gallery.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
<p><em>Great shouts within and all cry 'The mean knight!'</em></p>

<h1>A Midsummer Night's Dream</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</H3>
<h4>A wood near Athens.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter, from opposite sides, a Fairy, and PUCK</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>How now, spirit! whither wander you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Fairy</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>     Over hill, over dale,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Thorough bush, thorough brier,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Over park, over pale,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Thorough flood, thorough fire,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>I do wander everywhere,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Swifter than the moon's sphere;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And I serve the fairy queen,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>To dew her orbs upon the green.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>The cowslips tall her pensioners be:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>In their gold coats spots you see;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Those be rubies, fairy favours,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>In those freckles live their savours:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>I must go seek some dewdrops here</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Our queen and all our elves come here anon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>The king doth keep his revels here to-night:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Take heed the queen come not within his sight;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Because that she as her attendant hath</span><br/>
<span id='22'>A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>She never had so sweet a changeling;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And jealous Oberon would have the child</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>But she perforce withholds the loved boy,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And now they never meet in grove or green,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But, they do square, that all their elves for fear</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Fairy</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Either I mistake your shape and making quite,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he</span><br/>
<span id='35'>That frights the maidens of the villagery;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>You do their work, and they shall have good luck:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Are not you he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>                  Thou speak'st aright;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>I am that merry wanderer of the night.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>I jest to Oberon and make him smile</span><br/>
<span id='46'>When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>In very likeness of a roasted crab,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And when she drinks, against her lips I bob</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear</span><br/>
<span id='58'>A merrier hour was never wasted there.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Fairy</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train; from the other, TITANIA, with hers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>I have forsworn his bed and company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Then I must be thy lady: but I know</span><br/>
<span id='66'>When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And in the shape of Corin sat all day,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Playing on pipes of corn and versing love</span><br/>
<span id='69'>To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Come from the farthest Steppe of India?</span><br/>
<span id='71'>But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>To Theseus must be wedded, and you come</span><br/>
<span id='74'>To give their bed joy and prosperity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night</span><br/>
<span id='79'>From Perigenia, whom he ravished?</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>With Ariadne and Antiopa?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>These are the forgeries of jealousy:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And never, since the middle summer's spring,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>By paved fountain or by rushy brook,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Or in the beached margent of the sea,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Contagious fogs; which falling in the land</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Have every pelting river made so proud</span><br/>
<span id='93'>That they have overborne their continents:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>The fold stands empty in the drowned field,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And the quaint mazes in the wanton green</span><br/>
<span id='101'>For lack of tread are undistinguishable:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>The human mortals want their winter here;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>No night is now with hymn or carol blest:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Pale in her anger, washes all the air,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>That rheumatic diseases do abound:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And thorough this distemperature we see</span><br/>
<span id='108'>The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown</span><br/>
<span id='111'>An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>The childing autumn, angry winter, change</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>By their increase, now knows not which is which:</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And this same progeny of evils comes</span><br/>
<span id='117'>From our debate, from our dissension;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>We are their parents and original.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Do you amend it then; it lies in you:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Why should Titania cross her Oberon?</span><br/>
<span id='121'>I do but beg a little changeling boy,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>To be my henchman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>                  Set your heart at rest:</span><br/>
<span id='124'>The fairy land buys not the child of me.</span><br/>
<span id='125'>His mother was a votaress of my order:</span><br/>
<span id='126'>And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Marking the embarked traders on the flood,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Following,&mdash;her womb then rich with my young squire,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Would imitate, and sail upon the land,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>To fetch me trifles, and return again,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.</span><br/>
<span id='137'>But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;</span><br/>
<span id='138'>And for her sake do I rear up her boy,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>And for her sake I will not part with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>How long within this wood intend you stay?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.</span><br/>
<span id='142'>If you will patiently dance in our round</span><br/>
<span id='143'>And see our moonlight revels, go with us;</span><br/>
<span id='144'>If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!</span><br/>
<span id='147'>We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit TITANIA with her train</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Till I torment thee for this injury.</span><br/>
<span id='150'>My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Since once I sat upon a promontory,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath</span><br/>
<span id='154'>That the rude sea grew civil at her song</span><br/>
<span id='155'>And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>To hear the sea-maid's music.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>I remember.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Flying between the cold moon and the earth,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took</span><br/>
<span id='161'>At a fair vestal throned by the west,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;</span><br/>
<span id='164'>But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And the imperial votaress passed on,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>In maiden meditation, fancy-free.</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:</span><br/>
<span id='169'>It fell upon a little western flower,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>And maidens call it love-in-idleness.</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:</span><br/>
<span id='173'>The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Will make or man or woman madly dote</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Upon the next live creature that it sees.</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Ere the leviathan can swim a league.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>I'll put a girdle round about the earth</span><br/>
<span id='179'>In forty minutes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>                  Having once this juice,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.</span><br/>
<span id='183'>The next thing then she waking looks upon,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>She shall pursue it with the soul of love:</span><br/>
<span id='187'>And ere I take this charm from off her sight,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>As I can take it with another herb,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>I'll make her render up her page to me.</span><br/>
<span id='190'>But who comes here? I am invisible;</span><br/>
<span id='191'>And I will overhear their conference.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?</span><br/>
<span id='194'>The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;</span><br/>
<span id='196'>And here am I, and wode within this wood,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Because I cannot meet my Hermia.</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>HELENA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;</span><br/>
<span id='200'>But yet you draw not iron, for my heart</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>And I shall have no power to follow you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HELENA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>And even for that do I love you the more.</span><br/>
<span id='207'>I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Unworthy as I am, to follow you.</span><br/>
<span id='212'>What worser place can I beg in your love,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='213'>And yet a place of high respect with me,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Than to be used as you use your dog?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='215'>Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;</span><br/>
<span id='216'>For I am sick when I do look on thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>HELENA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>And I am sick when I look not on you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>You do impeach your modesty too much,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>To leave the city and commit yourself</span><br/>
<span id='220'>Into the hands of one that loves you not;</span><br/>
<span id='221'>To trust the opportunity of night</span><br/>
<span id='222'>And the ill counsel of a desert place</span><br/>
<span id='223'>With the rich worth of your virginity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>HELENA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='224'>Your virtue is my privilege: for that</span><br/>
<span id='225'>It is not night when I do see your face,</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Therefore I think I am not in the night;</span><br/>
<span id='227'>Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,</span><br/>
<span id='228'>For you in my respect are all the world:</span><br/>
<span id='229'>Then how can it be said I am alone,</span><br/>
<span id='230'>When all the world is here to look on me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='231'>I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,</span><br/>
<span id='232'>And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>HELENA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='233'>The wildest hath not such a heart as you.</span><br/>
<span id='234'>Run when you will, the story shall be changed:</span><br/>
<span id='235'>Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;</span><br/>
<span id='236'>The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind</span><br/>
<span id='237'>Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,</span><br/>
<span id='238'>When cowardice pursues and valour flies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='239'>I will not stay thy questions; let me go:</span><br/>
<span id='240'>Or, if thou follow me, do not believe</span><br/>
<span id='241'>But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>HELENA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='242'>Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,</span><br/>
<span id='243'>You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!</span><br/>
<span id='244'>Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:</span><br/>
<span id='245'>We cannot fight for love, as men may do;</span><br/>
<span id='246'>We should be wood and were not made to woo.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit DEMETRIUS</em></p>
<span id='247'>I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,</span><br/>
<span id='248'>To die upon the hand I love so well.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='249'>Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,</span><br/>
<span id='250'>Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter PUCK</em></p>
<span id='251'>Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='252'>Ay, there it is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='253'>I pray thee, give it me.</span><br/>
<span id='254'>I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,</span><br/>
<span id='255'>Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,</span><br/>
<span id='256'>Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,</span><br/>
<span id='257'>With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:</span><br/>
<span id='258'>There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,</span><br/>
<span id='259'>Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;</span><br/>
<span id='260'>And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,</span><br/>
<span id='261'>Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:</span><br/>
<span id='262'>And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='263'>And make her full of hateful fantasies.</span><br/>
<span id='264'>Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:</span><br/>
<span id='265'>A sweet Athenian lady is in love</span><br/>
<span id='266'>With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;</span><br/>
<span id='267'>But do it when the next thing he espies</span><br/>
<span id='268'>May be the lady: thou shalt know the man</span><br/>
<span id='269'>By the Athenian garments he hath on.</span><br/>
<span id='270'>Effect it with some care, that he may prove</span><br/>
<span id='271'>More fond on her than she upon her love:</span><br/>
<span id='272'>And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.</span><br/>

<span id='273'>Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

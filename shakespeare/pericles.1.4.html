<h1>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Tarsus. A room in the Governor's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CLEON, the governor of Tarsus, with DIONYZA, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CLEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And by relating tales of others' griefs,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DIONYZA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>For who digs hills because they do aspire</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CLEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>O Dionyza,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>They may awake their helps to comfort them.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DIONYZA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>I'll do my best, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CLEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>A city on whom plenty held full hand,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Like one another's glass to trim them by:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And not so much to feed on as delight;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>The name of help grew odious to repeat.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DIONYZA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>O, 'tis too true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CLEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>But see what heaven can do! By this our change,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Were all too little to content and please,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Although they gave their creatures in abundance,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>As houses are defiled for want of use,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>They are now starved for want of exercise:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Must have inventions to delight the taste,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Thought nought too curious, are ready now</span><br/>
<span id='44'>To eat those little darlings whom they loved.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Here many sink, yet those which see them fall</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Have scarce strength left to give them burial.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Is not this true?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DIONYZA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CLEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>O, let those cities that of plenty's cup</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And her prosperities so largely taste,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!</span><br/>
<span id='55'>The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Lord</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Where's the lord governor?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CLEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Here.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>For comfort is too far for us to expect.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>A portly sail of ships make hitherward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CLEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I thought as much.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>That may succeed as his inheritor;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Taking advantage of our misery,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>To beat us down, the which are down already;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And make a conquest of unhappy me,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Whereas no glory's got to overcome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>That's the least fear; for, by the semblance</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Of their white flags display'd, they bring us peace,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And come to us as favourers, not as foes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CLEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>But bring they what they will and what they can,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>What need we fear?</span><br/>
<span id='78'>The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Go tell their general we attend him here,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And what he craves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>I go, my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CLEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>If wars, we are unable to resist.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PERICLES with Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Lord governor, for so we hear you are,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Let not our ships and number of our men</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And seen the desolation of your streets:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>But to relieve them of their heavy load;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And these our ships, you happily may think</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within</span><br/>
<span id='94'>With bloody veins, expecting overthrow,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>The gods of Greece protect you!</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And we'll pray for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Arise, I pray you, rise:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>We do not look for reverence, but to love,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And harbourage for ourself, our ships, and men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CLEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>The which when any shall not gratify,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Till when,&mdash;the which I hope shall ne'er be seen,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Your grace is welcome to our town and us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Which welcome we'll accept; feast here awhile,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GOWER</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>GOWER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Here have you seen a mighty king</span><br/>
<span id='111'>His child, I wis, to incest bring;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>A better prince and benign lord,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>That will prove awful both in deed and word.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Be quiet then as men should be,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Till he hath pass'd necessity.</span><br/>
<span id='116'>I'll show you those in troubles reign,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Losing a mite, a mountain gain.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>The good in conversation,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>To whom I give my benison,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Is still at Tarsus, where each man</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Thinks all is writ he speken can;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And, to remember what he does,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Build his statue to make him glorious:</span><br/>
<span id='124'>But tidings to the contrary</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Are brought your eyes; what need speak I?</span><br/>
<p>DUMB SHOW.</p>
<p><em>Enter at one door PERICLES talking with CLEON; all  the train with them. Enter at another door a  Gentleman, with a letter to PERICLES; PERICLES  shows the letter to CLEON; gives the Messenger a  reward, and knights him. Exit PERICLES at one door, and CLEON at another</em></p>
<span id='126'>Good Helicane, that stay'd at home,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Not to eat honey like a drone</span><br/>
<span id='128'>From others' labours; for though he strive</span><br/>
<span id='129'>To killen bad, keep good alive;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And to fulfil his prince' desire,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Sends word of all that haps in Tyre:</span><br/>
<span id='132'>How Thaliard came full bent with sin</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And had intent to murder him;</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And that in Tarsus was not best</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Longer for him to make his rest.</span><br/>
<span id='136'>He, doing so, put forth to seas,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Where when men been, there's seldom ease;</span><br/>
<span id='138'>For now the wind begins to blow;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Thunder above and deeps below</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Make such unquiet, that the ship</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Should house him safe is wreck'd and split;</span><br/>
<span id='142'>And he, good prince, having all lost,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>By waves from coast to coast is tost:</span><br/>
<span id='144'>All perishen of man, of pelf,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Ne aught escapen but himself;</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Till fortune, tired with doing bad,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Threw him ashore, to give him glad:</span><br/>
<span id='148'>And here he comes. What shall be next,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Pardon old Gower,&mdash;this longs the text.</span><br/>

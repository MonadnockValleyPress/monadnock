<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Paris. The King's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter HELENA and Clown</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>My mother greets me kindly; is she well?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>She is not well; but yet she has her health: she's</span><br/>
<span id='3'>very merry; but yet she is not well: but thanks be</span><br/>
<span id='4'>given, she's very well and wants nothing i', the</span><br/>
<span id='5'>world; but yet she is not well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>If she be very well, what does she ail, that she's</span><br/>
<span id='7'>not very well?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>What two things?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her</span><br/>
<span id='11'>quickly! the other that she's in earth, from whence</span><br/>
<span id='12'>God send her quickly!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PAROLLES</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Bless you, my fortunate lady!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own</span><br/>
<span id='15'>good fortunes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them</span><br/>
<span id='17'>on, have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>So that you had her wrinkles and I her money,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I would she did as you say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Why, I say nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's</span><br/>
<span id='22'>tongue shakes out his master's undoing: to say</span><br/>
<span id='23'>nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have</span><br/>
<span id='24'>nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which</span><br/>
<span id='25'>is within a very little of nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Away! thou'rt a knave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a</span><br/>
<span id='28'>knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had</span><br/>
<span id='29'>been truth, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you</span><br/>
<span id='32'>taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>and much fool may you find in you, even to the</span><br/>
<span id='34'>world's pleasure and the increase of laughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Madam, my lord will go away to-night;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>A very serious business calls on him.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>The great prerogative and rite of love,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Which they distil now in the curbed time,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And pleasure drown the brim.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>What's his will else?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>That you will take your instant leave o' the king</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And make this haste as your own good proceeding,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Strengthen'd with what apology you think</span><br/>
<span id='49'>May make it probable need.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>What more commands he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>That, having this obtain'd, you presently</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Attend his further pleasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>In every thing I wait upon his will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>I shall report it so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>I pray you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit PAROLLES</em></p>
<span id='56'>Come, sirrah.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

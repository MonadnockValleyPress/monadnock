<h1>Henry VI, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Paris. A hall of state.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, BISHOP OF  WINCHESTER, YORK, SUFFOLK, SOMERSET, WARWICK, TALBOT, EXETER, the Governor, of Paris, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Lord bishop, set the crown upon his head.</span><br/>
<span id='2'>BISHOP</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>OF WINCHESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>God save King Henry, of that name the sixth!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Now, governor of Paris, take your oath,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>That you elect no other king but him;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And none your foes but such as shall pretend</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Malicious practises against his state:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>This shall ye do, so help you righteous God!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter FASTOLFE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>FASTOLFE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To haste unto your coronation,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>A letter was deliver'd to my hands,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Writ to your grace from the Duke of Burgundy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>TALBOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!</span><br/>
<span id='15'>I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>To tear the garter from thy craven's leg,</span><br/>
<p><em>Plucking it off</em></p>
<span id='17'>Which I have done, because unworthily</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Thou wast installed in that high degree.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest</span><br/>
<span id='20'>This dastard, at the battle of Patay,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>When but in all I was six thousand strong</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And that the French were almost ten to one,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Before we met or that a stroke was given,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Like to a trusty squire did run away:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Myself and divers gentlemen beside</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Were there surprised and taken prisoners.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Or whether that such cowards ought to wear</span><br/>
<span id='30'>This ornament of knighthood, yea or no.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>To say the truth, this fact was infamous</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And ill beseeming any common man,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Much more a knight, a captain and a leader.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>TALBOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Knights of the garter were of noble birth,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Such as were grown to credit by the wars;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>But always resolute in most extremes.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>He then that is not furnish'd in this sort</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Profaning this most honourable order,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And should, if I were worthy to be judge,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain</span><br/>
<span id='45'>That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom!</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit FASTOLFE</em></p>
<span id='49'>And now, my lord protector, view the letter</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>What means his grace, that he hath changed his style?</span><br/>
<span id='52'>No more but, plain and bluntly, 'To the king!'</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Or doth this churlish superscription</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Pretend some alteration in good will?</span><br/>
<span id='56'>What's here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='57'>'I have, upon especial cause,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Together with the pitiful complaints</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Of such as your oppression feeds upon,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Forsaken your pernicious faction</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.'</span><br/>
<span id='63'>O monstrous treachery! can this be so,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>That in alliance, amity and oaths,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>There should be found such false dissembling guile?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Is that the worst this letter doth contain?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And give him chastisement for this abuse.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>How say you, my lord? are you not content?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TALBOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Content, my liege! yes, but that I am prevented,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Then gather strength and march unto him straight:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And what offence it is to flout his friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>TALBOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>I go, my lord, in heart desiring still</span><br/>
<span id='79'>You may behold confusion of your foes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter VERNON and BASSET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>VERNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>BASSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>This is my servant: hear him, noble prince.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Be patient, lords; and give them leave to speak.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>VERNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>With him, my lord; for he hath done me wrong.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BASSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>What is that wrong whereof you both complain?</span><br/>
<span id='90'>First let me know, and then I'll answer you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BASSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Crossing the sea from England into France,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Upbraided me about the rose I wear;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>When stubbornly he did repugn the truth</span><br/>
<span id='97'>About a certain question in the law</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>With other vile and ignominious terms:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>In confutation of which rude reproach</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And in defence of my lord's worthiness,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>I crave the benefit of law of arms.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>VERNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>And that is my petition, noble lord:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>For though he seem with forged quaint conceit</span><br/>
<span id='105'>To set a gloss upon his bold intent,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And he first took exceptions at this badge,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>When for so slight and frivolous a cause</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Such factious emulations shall arise!</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Let this dissension first be tried by fight,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And then your highness shall command a peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>VERNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Nay, let it rest where it began at first.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>BASSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!</span><br/>
<span id='126'>And perish ye, with your audacious prate!</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed</span><br/>
<span id='128'>With this immodest clamorous outrage</span><br/>
<span id='129'>To trouble and disturb the king and us?</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And you, my lords, methinks you do not well</span><br/>
<span id='131'>To bear with their perverse objections;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Much less to take occasion from their mouths</span><br/>
<span id='133'>To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Let me persuade you take a better course.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>EXETER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>It grieves his highness: good my lords, be friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Come hither, you that would be combatants:</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.</span><br/>
<span id='139'>And you, my lords, remember where we are,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation:</span><br/>
<span id='141'>If they perceive dissension in our looks</span><br/>
<span id='142'>And that within ourselves we disagree,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>How will their grudging stomachs be provoked</span><br/>
<span id='144'>To wilful disobedience, and rebel!</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Beside, what infamy will there arise,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>When foreign princes shall be certified</span><br/>
<span id='147'>That for a toy, a thing of no regard,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>King Henry's peers and chief nobility</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!</span><br/>
<span id='150'>O, think upon the conquest of my father,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>My tender years, and let us not forego</span><br/>
<span id='152'>That for a trifle that was bought with blood</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.</span><br/>
<span id='154'>I see no reason, if I wear this rose,</span><br/>
<p><em>Putting on a red rose</em></p>
<span id='155'>That any one should therefore be suspicious</span><br/>
<span id='156'>I more incline to Somerset than York:</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both:</span><br/>
<span id='158'>As well they may upbraid me with my crown,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown'd.</span><br/>
<span id='160'>But your discretions better can persuade</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Than I am able to instruct or teach:</span><br/>
<span id='162'>And therefore, as we hither came in peace,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>So let us still continue peace and love.</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Cousin of York, we institute your grace</span><br/>
<span id='165'>To be our regent in these parts of France:</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;</span><br/>
<span id='168'>And, like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Go cheerfully together and digest.</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Your angry choler on your enemies.</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Ourself, my lord protector and the rest</span><br/>
<span id='172'>After some respite will return to Calais;</span><br/>
<span id='173'>From thence to England; where I hope ere long</span><br/>
<span id='174'>To be presented, by your victories,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>With Charles, Alencon and that traitorous rout.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK, WARWICK, EXETER and VERNON</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>My Lord of York, I promise you, the king</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Prettily, methought, did play the orator.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>And so he did; but yet I like it not,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>In that he wears the badge of Somerset.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Tush, that was but his fancy, blame him not;</span><br/>
<span id='181'>I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>An if I wist he did,&mdash;but let it rest;</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Other affairs must now be managed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but EXETER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>EXETER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice;</span><br/>
<span id='185'>For, had the passions of thy heart burst out,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>I fear we should have seen decipher'd there</span><br/>
<span id='187'>More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Than yet can be imagined or supposed.</span><br/>
<span id='189'>But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees</span><br/>
<span id='190'>This jarring discord of nobility,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>This shouldering of each other in the court,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>This factious bandying of their favourites,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>But that it doth presage some ill event.</span><br/>
<span id='194'>'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;</span><br/>
<span id='195'>But more when envy breeds unkind division;</span><br/>
<span id='196'>There comes the rain, there begins confusion.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

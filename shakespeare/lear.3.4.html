<h1>King Lear</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>The heath. Before a hovel.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The tyranny of the open night's too rough</span><br/>
<span id='3'>For nature to endure.</span><br/>
<p><em>Storm still</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Let me alone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Good my lord, enter here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Wilt break my heart?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>But where the greater malady is fix'd,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'ldst shun a bear;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the</span><br/>
<span id='14'>mind's free,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Doth from my senses take all feeling else</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand</span><br/>
<span id='19'>For lifting food to't? But I will punish home:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>No, I will weep no more. In such a night</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>No more of that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>                  Good my lord, enter here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Prithee, go in thyself: seek thine own ease:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>This tempest will not give me leave to ponder</span><br/>
<span id='29'>On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.</span><br/>
<p><em>To the Fool</em></p>
<span id='30'>In, boy; go first. You houseless poverty,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.</span><br/>
<p><em>Fool goes in</em></p>
<span id='32'>Poor naked wretches, whereso'er you are,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you</span><br/>
<span id='36'>From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And show the heavens more just.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>[Within]  Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!</span><br/>
<p><em>The Fool runs out from the hovel</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Help me, help me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Give me thy hand. Who's there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>A spirit, a spirit: he says his name's poor Tom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>What art thou that dost grumble there i' the straw?</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Come forth.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter EDGAR disguised as a mad man</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Away! the foul fiend follows me!</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Hum! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Hast thou given all to thy two daughters?</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And art thou come to this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Who gives any thing to poor Tom? whom the foul</span><br/>
<span id='54'>fiend hath led through fire and through flame, and</span><br/>
<span id='55'>through ford and whirlipool e'er bog and quagmire;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>that hath laid knives under his pillow, and halters</span><br/>
<span id='57'>in his pew; set ratsbane by his porridge; made film</span><br/>
<span id='58'>proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting-horse over</span><br/>
<span id='59'>four-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for a</span><br/>
<span id='60'>traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom's a-cold,&mdash;O, do</span><br/>
<span id='61'>de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some</span><br/>
<span id='63'>charity, whom the foul fiend vexes: there could I</span><br/>
<span id='64'>have him now,&mdash;and there,&mdash;and there again, and there.</span><br/>
<p><em>Storm still</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give them all?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous air</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>He hath no daughters, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Death, traitor! nothing could have subdued nature</span><br/>
<span id='72'>To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Is it the fashion, that discarded fathers</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begot</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Those pelican daughters.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Halloo, halloo, loo, loo!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Take heed o' the foul fiend: obey thy parents;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not with</span><br/>
<span id='82'>man's sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud</span><br/>
<span id='83'>array. Tom's a-cold.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>What hast thou been?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curled</span><br/>
<span id='86'>my hair; wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of</span><br/>
<span id='87'>my mistress' heart, and did the act of darkness with</span><br/>
<span id='88'>her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and</span><br/>
<span id='89'>broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that</span><br/>
<span id='90'>slept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it:</span><br/>
<span id='91'>wine loved I deeply, dice dearly: and in woman</span><br/>
<span id='92'>out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light of</span><br/>
<span id='93'>ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of</span><br/>
<span id='96'>silks betray thy poor heart to woman: keep thy foot</span><br/>
<span id='97'>out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen</span><br/>
<span id='98'>from lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Says suum, mun, ha, no, nonny.</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let him trot by.</span><br/>
<p><em>Storm still</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer</span><br/>
<span id='103'>with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou</span><br/>
<span id='105'>owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep</span><br/>
<span id='106'>no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here's three on</span><br/>
<span id='107'>'s are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!</span><br/>
<span id='110'>come unbutton here.</span><br/>
<p><em>Tearing off his clothes</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Prithee, nuncle, be contented; 'tis a naughty night</span><br/>
<span id='112'>to swim in. Now a little fire in a wild field were</span><br/>
<span id='113'>like an old lecher's heart; a small spark, all the</span><br/>
<span id='114'>rest on's body cold. Look, here comes a walking fire.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GLOUCESTER, with a torch</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins</span><br/>
<span id='116'>at curfew, and walks till the first cock; he gives</span><br/>
<span id='117'>the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes the</span><br/>
<span id='118'>hare-lip; mildews the white wheat, and hurts the</span><br/>
<span id='119'>poor creature of earth.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>S. Withold footed thrice the old;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>He met the night-mare, and her nine-fold;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Bid her alight,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>And her troth plight,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And, aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='125'>How fares your grace?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>

<span id='126'>What's he?</span><br/>

<span id='128'>What are you there? Your names?</span><br/>

<span id='speech44'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>

<span id='129'>Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water; that in</span><br/>
<span id='131'>the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat and</span><br/>
<span id='133'>the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the</span><br/>
<span id='134'>standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to</span><br/>
<span id='135'>tithing, and stock- punished, and imprisoned; who</span><br/>
<span id='136'>hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his</span><br/>
<span id='137'>body, horse to ride, and weapon to wear;</span><br/>
<span id='138'>But mice and rats, and such small deer,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Have been Tom's food for seven long year.</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend!</span><br/>

<span id='165'>Thou say'st the king grows mad; I'll tell thee, friend,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>I am almost mad myself: I had a son,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Now outlaw'd from my blood; he sought my life,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>But lately, very late: I loved him, friend;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>No father his son dearer: truth to tell thee,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>The grief hath crazed my wits. What a night's this!</span><br/>

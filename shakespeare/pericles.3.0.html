<h1>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Prologue</h3>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GOWER</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GOWER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now sleep y-slaked hath the rout;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>No din but snores the house about,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Made louder by the o'er-fed breast</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Of this most pompous marriage-feast.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>The cat, with eyne of burning coal,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Now crouches fore the mouse's hole;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And crickets sing at the oven's mouth,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>E'er the blither for their drouth.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Hymen hath brought the bride to bed.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Where, by the loss of maidenhead,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>A babe is moulded. Be attent,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And time that is so briefly spent</span><br/>
<span id='13'>With your fine fancies quaintly eche:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.</span><br/>
<p>DUMB SHOW.</p>
<p><em>Enter, PERICLES and SIMONIDES at one door, with  Attendants; a Messenger meets them, kneels, and  gives PERICLES a letter: PERICLES shows it  SIMONIDES; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter  THAISA with child, with LYCHORIDA a nurse. The  KING shows her the letter; she rejoices: she and  PERICLES takes leave of her father, and depart with  LYCHORIDA and their Attendants. Then exeunt SIMONIDES and the rest</em></p>
<span id='15'>By many a dern and painful perch</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Of Pericles the careful search,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>By the four opposing coigns</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Which the world together joins,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Is made with all due diligence</span><br/>
<span id='20'>That horse and sail and high expense</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Fame answering the most strange inquire,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To the court of King Simonides</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Are letters brought, the tenor these:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Antiochus and his daughter dead;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>The men of Tyrus on the head</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Of Helicanus would set on</span><br/>
<span id='28'>The crown of Tyre, but he will none:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Says to 'em, if King Pericles</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Come not home in twice six moons,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>He, obedient to their dooms,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Will take the crown. The sum of this,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Brought hither to Pentapolis,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Y-ravished the regions round,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And every one with claps can sound,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>'Our heir-apparent is a king!</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>His queen with child makes her desire&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Which who shall cross?&mdash;along to go:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Omit we all their dole and woe:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And so to sea. Their vessel shakes</span><br/>
<span id='45'>On Neptune's billow; half the flood</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Hath their keel cut: but fortune's mood</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Varies again; the grisly north</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Disgorges such a tempest forth,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>That, as a duck for life that dives,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>So up and down the poor ship drives:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>The lady shrieks, and well-a-near</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Does fall in travail with her fear:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And what ensues in this fell storm</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Shall for itself itself perform.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>I nill relate, action may</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Conveniently the rest convey;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Which might not what by me is told.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>In your imagination hold</span><br/>
<span id='59'>This stage the ship, upon whose deck</span><br/>
<span id='60'>The sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

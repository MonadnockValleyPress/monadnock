<h1>Richard III</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>London. The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, young YORK, QUEEN ELIZABETH, and the DUCHESS OF YORK</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>I long with all my heart to see the prince:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>But I hear, no; they say my son of York</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow</span><br/>
<span id='12'>More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Gloucester,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold</span><br/>
<span id='18'>In him that did object the same to thee;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>So long a-growing and so leisurely,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast</span><br/>
<span id='29'>That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old</span><br/>
<span id='30'>'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Grandam, his nurse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Good madam, be not angry with the child.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Pitchers have ears.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Here comes a messenger. What news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>How fares the prince?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Well, madam, and in health.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>What is thy news then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Who hath committed them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>The mighty dukes</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Gloucester and Buckingham.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>For what offence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Why or for what these nobles were committed</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!</span><br/>
<span id='54'>The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Insulting tyranny begins to jet</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Upon the innocent and aweless throne:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!</span><br/>
<span id='58'>I see, as in a map, the end of all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>How many of you have mine eyes beheld!</span><br/>
<span id='61'>My husband lost his life to get the crown;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And often up and down my sons were toss'd,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And being seated, and domestic broils</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Self against self: O, preposterous</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Or let me die, to look on death no more!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Madam, farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>                  I'll go along with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>You have no cause.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>                  My gracious lady, go;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And thither bear your treasure and your goods.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>For my part, I'll resign unto your grace</span><br/>
<span id='77'>The seal I keep: and so betide to me</span><br/>
<span id='78'>As well I tender you and all of yours!</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

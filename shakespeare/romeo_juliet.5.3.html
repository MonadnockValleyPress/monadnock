<h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene III</h3>
<h4>A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>As signal that thou hear'st something approach.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>[Aside]  I am almost afraid to stand alone</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.</span><br/>
<p><em>Retires</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The obsequies that I for thee will keep</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.</span><br/>
<p><em>The Page whistles</em></p>
<span id='18'>The boy gives warning something doth approach.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?</span><br/>
<span id='21'>What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.</span><br/>
<p><em>Retires</em></p>
<p><em>Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock,  & c</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Hold, take this letter; early in the morning</span><br/>
<span id='24'>See thou deliver it to my lord and father.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And do not interrupt me in my course.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Why I descend into this bed of death,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Is partly to behold my lady's face;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger</span><br/>
<span id='31'>A precious ring, a ring that I must use</span><br/>
<span id='32'>In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry</span><br/>
<span id='34'>In what I further shall intend to do,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>The time and my intents are savage-wild,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>More fierce and more inexorable far</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.</span><br/>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BALTHASAR</strong></span>

<span id='40'>I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.</span><br/>

<span id='42'>Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.</span><br/>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BALTHASAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>[Aside]  For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.</span><br/>
<p><em>Retires</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!</span><br/>
<p><em>Opens the tomb</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>This is that banish'd haughty Montague,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>It is supposed, the fair creature died;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And here is come to do some villanous shame</span><br/>
<span id='53'>To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Comes forward</em></p>
<span id='54'>Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Can vengeance be pursued further than death?</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Put not another sin upon my head,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>By urging me to fury: O, be gone!</span><br/>
<span id='64'>By heaven, I love thee better than myself;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>For I come hither arm'd against myself:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>A madman's mercy bade thee run away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!</span><br/>
<span id='77'>What said my man, when my betossed soul</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Did not attend him as we rode? I think</span><br/>
<span id='79'>He told me Paris should have married Juliet:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Said he not so? or did I dream it so?</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!</span><br/>
<span id='84'>I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes</span><br/>
<span id='87'>This vault a feasting presence full of light.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.</span><br/>
<p><em>Laying PARIS in the tomb</em></p>
<span id='89'>How oft when men are at the point of death</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Have they been merry! which their keepers call</span><br/>
<span id='91'>A lightning before death: O, how may I</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And death's pale flag is not advanced there.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?</span><br/>
<span id='99'>O, what more favour can I do to thee,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain</span><br/>
<span id='101'>To sunder his that was thine enemy?</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe</span><br/>
<span id='104'>That unsubstantial death is amorous,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And that the lean abhorred monster keeps</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Thee here in dark to be his paramour?</span><br/>
<span id='107'>For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And never from this palace of dim night</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Depart again: here, here will I remain</span><br/>
<span id='110'>With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Will I set up my everlasting rest,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars</span><br/>
<span id='113'>From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you</span><br/>
<span id='115'>The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss</span><br/>
<span id='116'>A dateless bargain to engrossing death!</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on</span><br/>
<span id='119'>The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Here's to my love!</span><br/>
<p><em>Drinks</em></p>
<span id='121'>O true apothecary!</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.</span><br/>
<p><em>Dies</em></p>

<span id='254'>As I intended, for it wrought on her</span><br/>
<span id='255'>The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,</span><br/>
<span id='256'>That he should hither come as this dire night,</span><br/>
<span id='257'>To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,</span><br/>
<span id='258'>Being the time the potion's force should cease.</span><br/>
<span id='259'>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</span><br/>
<span id='260'>Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight</span><br/>
<span id='261'>Return'd my letter back. Then all alone</span><br/>
<span id='262'>At the prefixed hour of her waking,</span><br/>
<span id='263'>Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;</span><br/>
<span id='264'>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,</span><br/>
<span id='265'>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:</span><br/>
<span id='266'>But when I came, some minute ere the time</span><br/>
<span id='267'>Of her awaking, here untimely lay</span><br/>
<span id='268'>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</span><br/>
<span id='269'>She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,</span><br/>
<span id='270'>And bear this work of heaven with patience:</span><br/>
<span id='271'>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;</span><br/>
<span id='272'>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</span><br/>
<span id='273'>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</span><br/>
<span id='274'>All this I know; and to the marriage</span><br/>
<span id='275'>Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this</span><br/>
<span id='276'>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</span><br/>
<span id='277'>Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,</span><br/>
<span id='278'>Unto the rigour of severest law.</span><br/>

<span id='284'>This letter he early bid me give his father,</span><br/>
<span id='285'>And threatened me with death, going in the vault,</span><br/>
<span id='286'>I departed not and left him there.</span><br/>

<span id='293'>And by and by my master drew on him;</span><br/>
<span id='294'>And then I ran away to call the watch.</span><br/>

<span id='298'>Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal</span><br/>

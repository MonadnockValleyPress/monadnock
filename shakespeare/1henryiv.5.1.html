<h1>Henry IV, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>King Henry IV's camp near Shrewsbury.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING HENRY, PRINCE HENRY, Lord John of  LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and FALSTAFF</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>How bloodily the sun begins to peer</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale</span><br/>
<span id='3'>At his distemperature.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>The southern wind</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And by his hollow whistling in the leaves</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Then with the losers let it sympathize,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>For nothing can seem foul to those that win.</span><br/>
<p><em>The trumpet sounds</em></p>
<p><em>Enter WORCESTER and VERNON</em></p>
<span id='10'>How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well</span><br/>
<span id='11'>That you and I should meet upon such terms</span><br/>
<span id='12'>As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And made us doff our easy robes of peace,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>This is not well, my lord, this is not well.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>What say you to it? will you again unknit</span><br/>
<span id='17'>This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And move in that obedient orb again</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Where you did give a fair and natural light,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And be no more an exhaled meteor,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>A prodigy of fear and a portent</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Of broached mischief to the unborn times?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Hear me, my liege:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>For mine own part, I could be well content</span><br/>
<span id='25'>To entertain the lag-end of my life</span><br/>
<span id='26'>With quiet hours; for I do protest,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>I have not sought the day of this dislike.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>You have not sought it! how comes it, then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Peace, chewet, peace!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>It pleased your majesty to turn your looks</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Of favour from myself and all our house;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And yet I must remember you, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>We were the first and dearest of your friends.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>For you my staff of office did I break</span><br/>
<span id='36'>In Richard's time; and posted day and night</span><br/>
<span id='37'>To meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>When yet you were in place and in account</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>It was myself, my brother and his son,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>That brought you home and boldly did outdare</span><br/>
<span id='42'>The dangers of the time. You swore to us,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>To this we swore our aid. But in short space</span><br/>
<span id='48'>It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And such a flood of greatness fell on you,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>What with our help, what with the absent king,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>What with the injuries of a wanton time,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The seeming sufferances that you had borne,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And the contrarious winds that held the king</span><br/>
<span id='54'>So long in his unlucky Irish wars</span><br/>
<span id='55'>That all in England did repute him dead:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And from this swarm of fair advantages</span><br/>
<span id='57'>You took occasion to be quickly woo'd</span><br/>
<span id='58'>To gripe the general sway into your hand;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And being fed by us you used us so</span><br/>
<span id='61'>As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk</span><br/>
<span id='64'>That even our love durst not come near your sight</span><br/>
<span id='65'>For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing</span><br/>
<span id='66'>We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Out of sight and raise this present head;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Whereby we stand opposed by such means</span><br/>
<span id='69'>As you yourself have forged against yourself</span><br/>
<span id='70'>By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And violation of all faith and troth</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>These things indeed you have articulate,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>To face the garment of rebellion</span><br/>
<span id='76'>With some fine colour that may please the eye</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Which gape and rub the elbow at the news</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Of hurlyburly innovation:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And never yet did insurrection want</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Such water-colours to impaint his cause;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Nor moody beggars, starving for a time</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Of pellmell havoc and confusion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>In both your armies there is many a soul</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world</span><br/>
<span id='88'>In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>This present enterprise set off his head,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>I do not think a braver gentleman,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>More active-valiant or more valiant-young,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>More daring or more bold, is now alive</span><br/>
<span id='93'>To grace this latter age with noble deeds.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>For my part, I may speak it to my shame,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>I have a truant been to chivalry;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And so I hear he doth account me too;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Yet this before my father's majesty&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>I am content that he shall take the odds</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Of his great name and estimation,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And will, to save the blood on either side,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Try fortune with him in a single fight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Albeit considerations infinite</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>We love our people well; even those we love</span><br/>
<span id='106'>That are misled upon your cousin's part;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And, will they take the offer of our grace,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Both he and they and you, every man</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>So tell your cousin, and bring me word</span><br/>
<span id='111'>What he will do: but if he will not yield,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Rebuke and dread correction wait on us</span><br/>
<span id='113'>And they shall do their office. So, be gone;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>We will not now be troubled with reply:</span><br/>
<span id='115'>We offer fair; take it advisedly.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>It will not be accepted, on my life:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>The Douglas and the Hotspur both together</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Are confident against the world in arms.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge;</span><br/>
<span id='120'>For, on their answer, will we set on them:</span><br/>
<span id='121'>And God befriend us, as our cause is just!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride</span><br/>
<span id='123'>me, so; 'tis a point of friendship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Say thy prayers, and farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>I  would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Why, thou owest God a death.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit PRINCE HENRY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before</span><br/>
<span id='129'>his day. What need I be so forward with him that</span><br/>
<span id='130'>calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks</span><br/>
<span id='131'>me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I</span><br/>
<span id='132'>come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or</span><br/>
<span id='133'>an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is</span><br/>
<span id='135'>honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what</span><br/>
<span id='136'>is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?</span><br/>
<span id='137'>he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>to the dead. But will it not live with the living?</span><br/>
<span id='140'>no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore</span><br/>
<span id='141'>I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so</span><br/>
<span id='142'>ends my catechism.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter certain Murderers, hastily</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Murderer</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Run to my Lord of Suffolk; let him know</span><br/>
<span id='2'>We have dispatch'd the duke, as he commanded.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>O that it were to do! What have we done?</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Didst ever hear a man so penitent?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SUFFOLK</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>First Murder</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Here comes my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Now, sirs, have you dispatch'd this thing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Murderer</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Ay, my good lord, he's dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Why, that's well said. Go, get you to my house;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>I will reward you for this venturous deed.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>The king and all the peers are here at hand.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>According as I gave directions?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>First Murderer</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>'Tis, my good lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Away! be gone.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Murderers</em></p>
<p><em>Sound trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL, SOMERSET, with Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Go, call our uncle to our presence straight;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Say we intend to try his grace to-day.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>If he be guilty, as 'tis published.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>I'll call him presently, my noble lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Lords, take your places; and, I pray you all,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle Gloucester</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Than from true evidence of good esteem</span><br/>
<span id='22'>He be approved in practise culpable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>God forbid any malice should prevail,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>That faultless may condemn a nobleman!</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>I thank thee, Meg; these words content me much.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter SUFFOLK</em></p>
<span id='27'>How now! why look'st thou pale? why tremblest thou?</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Where is our uncle? what's the matter, Suffolk?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Dead in his bed, my lord; Gloucester is dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Marry, God forfend!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>God's secret judgment: I did dream to-night</span><br/>
<span id='32'>The duke was dumb and could not speak a word.</span><br/>
<p><em>KING HENRY VI swoons</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>How fares my lord? Help, lords! the king is dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>He doth revive again: madam, be patient.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>O heavenly God!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>How fares my gracious lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Comfort, my sovereign! gracious Henry, comfort!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Came he right now to sing a raven's note,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>By crying comfort from a hollow breast,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Can chase away the first-conceived sound?</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Upon thy eye-balls murderous tyranny</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Sits in grim majesty, to fright the world.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Yet do not go away: come, basilisk,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>For in the shade of death I shall find joy;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>In life but double death, now Gloucester's dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Although the duke was enemy to him,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Yet he most Christian-like laments his death:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And for myself, foe as he was to me,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And all to have the noble duke alive.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>What know I how the world may deem of me?</span><br/>
<span id='67'>For it is known we were but hollow friends:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>It may be judged I made the duke away;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>This get I by his death: ay me, unhappy!</span><br/>
<span id='72'>To be a queen, and crown'd with infamy!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.</span><br/>
<span id='75'>What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?</span><br/>
<span id='76'>I am no loathsome leper; look on me.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Why, then, dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Erect his statue and worship it,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And make my image but an alehouse sign.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And twice by awkward wind from England's bank</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Drove back again unto my native clime?</span><br/>
<span id='86'>What boded this, but well forewarning wind</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?</span><br/>
<span id='89'>What did I then, but cursed the gentle gusts</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves:</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Yet AEolus would not be a murderer,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>But left that hateful office unto thee:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And would not dash me with their ragged sides,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Might in thy palace perish Margaret.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>I stood upon the hatches in the storm,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And when the dusky sky began to rob</span><br/>
<span id='106'>My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>I took a costly jewel from my neck,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And so I wish'd thy body might my heart:</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And even with this I lost fair England's view</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart</span><br/>
<span id='113'>And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.</span><br/>
<span id='115'>How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>The agent of thy foul inconstancy,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did</span><br/>
<span id='118'>When he to madding Dido would unfold</span><br/>
<span id='119'>His father's acts commenced in burning Troy!</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Ay me, I can no more! die, Margaret!</span><br/>
<span id='122'>For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.</span><br/>
<p><em>Noise within. Enter WARWICK, SALISBURY, and many Commons</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>It is reported, mighty sovereign,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murder'd</span><br/>
<span id='125'>By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means.</span><br/>
<span id='126'>The commons, like an angry hive of bees</span><br/>
<span id='127'>That want their leader, scatter up and down</span><br/>
<span id='128'>And care not who they sting in his revenge.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Until they hear the order of his death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>But how he died God knows, not Henry:</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And comment then upon his sudden death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>With the rude multitude till I return.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>My thoughts, that labour to persuade my soul</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!</span><br/>
<span id='140'>If my suspect be false, forgive me, God,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>For judgment only doth belong to thee.</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips</span><br/>
<span id='143'>With twenty thousand kisses, and to drain</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling:</span><br/>
<span id='147'>But all in vain are these mean obsequies;</span><br/>
<span id='148'>And to survey his dead and earthly image,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>What were it but to make my sorrow greater?</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter WARWICK and others, bearing GLOUCESTER'S body on a bed</em></p>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>That is to see how deep my grave is made;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>For seeing him I see my life in death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>As surely as my soul intends to live</span><br/>
<span id='155'>With that dread King that took our state upon him</span><br/>
<span id='156'>To free us from his father's wrathful curse,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>I do believe that violent hands were laid</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!</span><br/>
<span id='160'>What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>See how the blood is settled in his face.</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale and bloodless,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Being all descended to the labouring heart;</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth</span><br/>
<span id='168'>To blush and beautify the cheek again.</span><br/>
<span id='169'>But see, his face is black and full of blood,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>His eye-balls further out than when he lived,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Staring full ghastly like a strangled man;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretched with struggling;</span><br/>
<span id='173'>His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd</span><br/>
<span id='174'>And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued:</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Look, on the sheets his hair you see, is sticking;</span><br/>
<span id='176'>His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged.</span><br/>
<span id='178'>It cannot be but he was murder'd here;</span><br/>
<span id='179'>The least of all these signs were probable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Why, Warwick, who should do the duke to death?</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Myself and Beaufort had him in protection;</span><br/>
<span id='182'>And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>And you, forsooth, had the good duke to keep:</span><br/>
<span id='185'>'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;</span><br/>
<span id='186'>And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen</span><br/>
<span id='188'>As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh</span><br/>
<span id='190'>And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter?</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>But may imagine how the bird was dead,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Even so suspicious is this tragedy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>

<span id='196'>Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife?</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;</span><br/>
<span id='199'>But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart</span><br/>
<span id='201'>That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Say, if thou darest, proud Lord of Warwick-shire,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt CARDINAL, SOMERSET, and others</em></p>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>He dares not calm his contumelious spirit</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>Madam, be still; with reverence may I say;</span><br/>
<span id='209'>For every word you speak in his behalf</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Is slander to your royal dignity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></a>

<span id='211'>Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanor!</span><br/>
<span id='212'>If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>Thy mother took into her blameful bed</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Some stern untutor'd churl, and noble stock</span><br/>

<span id='220'>And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,</span><br/>
<span id='221'>I would, false murderous coward, on thy knee</span><br/>
<span id='222'>Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech,</span><br/>
<span id='223'>And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st</span><br/>
<span id='224'>That thou thyself was born in bastardy;</span><br/>

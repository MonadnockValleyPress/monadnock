<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Rousillon. The Count's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two French Lords, with Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Was made much poorer by it: but your son,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Her estimation home.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>'Tis past, my liege;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And I beseech your majesty to make it</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>O'erbears it and burns on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>My honour'd lady,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>I have forgiven and forgotten all;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Though my revenges were high bent upon him,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And watch'd the time to shoot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>This I must say,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>But first I beg my pardon, the young lord</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Offence of mighty note; but to himself</span><br/>
<span id='18'>The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Whose beauty did astonish the survey</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Humbly call'd mistress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Praising what is lost</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill</span><br/>
<span id='26'>All repetition: let him not ask our pardon;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>The nature of his great offence is dead,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And deeper than oblivion we do bury</span><br/>
<span id='29'>The incensing relics of it: let him approach,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>A stranger, no offender; and inform him</span><br/>
<span id='31'>So 'tis our will he should.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I shall, my liege.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>All that he is hath reference to your highness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me</span><br/>
<span id='36'>That set him high in fame.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BERTRAM</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>He looks well on't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>I am not a day of season,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail</span><br/>
<span id='40'>In me at once: but to the brightest beams</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>The time is fair again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>My high-repented blames,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Dear sovereign, pardon to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>All is whole;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Not one word more of the consumed time.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Let's take the instant by the forward top;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees</span><br/>
<span id='49'>The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Steals ere we can effect them. You remember</span><br/>
<span id='51'>The daughter of this lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Admiringly, my liege, at first</span><br/>
<span id='53'>I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Where the impression of mine eye infixing,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Which warp'd the line of every other favour;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Extended or contracted all proportions</span><br/>
<span id='60'>To a most hideous object: thence it came</span><br/>
<span id='61'>That she whom all men praised and whom myself,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye</span><br/>
<span id='63'>The dust that did offend it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Well excused:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away</span><br/>
<span id='66'>From the great compt: but love that comes too late,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>To the great sender turns a sour offence,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Make trivial price of serious things we have,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Not knowing them until we know their grave:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Destroy our friends and after weep their dust</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Our own love waking cries to see what's done,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>The main consents are had; and here we'll stay</span><br/>
<span id='79'>To see our widower's second marriage-day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Come on, my son, in whom my house's name</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Must be digested, give a favour from you</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>That she may quickly come.</span><br/>
<p><em>BERTRAM gives a ring</em></p>
<span id='86'>By my old beard,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>The last that e'er I took her at court,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>I saw upon her finger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Hers it was not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Necessitied to help, that by this token</span><br/>
<span id='97'>I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave</span><br/>
<span id='98'>her</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Of what should stead her most?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>My gracious sovereign,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>The ring was never hers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Son, on my life,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it</span><br/>
<span id='105'>At her life's rate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>I am sure I saw her wear it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought</span><br/>
<span id='111'>I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed</span><br/>
<span id='112'>To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully</span><br/>
<span id='113'>I could not answer in that course of honour</span><br/>
<span id='114'>As she had made the overture, she ceased</span><br/>
<span id='115'>In heavy satisfaction and would never</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Receive the ring again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Plutus himself,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Hath not in nature's mystery more science</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know</span><br/>
<span id='122'>That you are well acquainted with yourself,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement</span><br/>
<span id='124'>You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety</span><br/>
<span id='125'>That she would never put it from her finger,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Where you have never come, or sent it us</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Upon her great disaster.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>She never saw it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And makest conjectural fears to come into me</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove</span><br/>
<span id='133'>That thou art so inhuman,&mdash;'twill not prove so;&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And she is dead; which nothing, but to close</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>More than to see this ring. Take him away.</span><br/>
<p><em>Guards seize BERTRAM</em></p>
<span id='138'>My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Shall tax my fears of little vanity,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!</span><br/>
<span id='141'>We'll sift this matter further.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>If you shall prove</span><br/>
<span id='143'>This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Where yet she never was.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit, guarded</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KING</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Gentleman</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Gracious sovereign,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Here's a petition from a Florentine,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Who hath for four or five removes come short</span><br/>
<span id='151'>To tender it herself. I undertook it,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Is here attending: her business looks in her</span><br/>
<span id='155'>With an importing visage; and she told me,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Your highness with herself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='161'>are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He</span><br/>
<span id='162'>stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow</span><br/>
<span id='163'>him to his country for justice: grant it me, O</span><br/>

<span id='193'>You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;</span><br/>

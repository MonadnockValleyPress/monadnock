<h1>Henry VI, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Saint Alban's.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, GLOUCESTER, CARDINAL, and SUFFOLK, with Falconers halloing</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>I saw not better sport these seven years' day:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And, ten to one, old Joan had not gone out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And what a pitch she flew above the rest!</span><br/>
<span id='7'>To see how God in all his creatures works!</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>No marvel, an it like your majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>My lord protector's hawks do tower so well;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>They know their master loves to be aloft,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>My lord, 'tis but a base ignoble mind</span><br/>
<span id='14'>That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>I thought as much; he would be above the clouds.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Ay, my lord cardinal? how think you by that?</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Were it not good your grace could fly to heaven?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>The treasury of everlasting joy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Thy heaven is on earth; thine eyes and thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Pernicious protector, dangerous peer,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>That smooth'st it so with king and commonweal!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>What, cardinal, is your priesthood grown peremptory?</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Tantaene animis coelestibus irae?</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Churchmen so hot? good uncle, hide such malice;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>With such holiness can you do it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>No malice, sir; no more than well becomes</span><br/>
<span id='28'>So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>As who, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>       Why, as you, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>An't like your lordly lord-protectorship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>And thy ambition, Gloucester.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>I prithee, peace, good queen,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And whet not on these furious peers;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Let me be blessed for the peace I make,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Against this proud protector, with my sword!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>[Aside to CARDINAL]  Faith, holy uncle, would</span><br/>
<span id='40'>'twere come to that!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Marry, when thou darest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>[Aside to CARDINAL]  Make up no factious</span><br/>
<span id='43'>numbers for the matter;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>In thine own person answer thy abuse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Ay, where thou darest</span><br/>
<span id='46'>not peep: an if thou darest,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>This evening, on the east side of the grove.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>How now, my lords!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>       Believe me, cousin Gloucester,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>We had had more sport.</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside to GLOUCESTER</em></p>
<span id='52'>Come with thy two-hand sword.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>True, uncle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Are ye advised? the</span><br/>
<span id='55'>east side of the grove?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>[Aside to CARDINAL]  Cardinal, I am with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Why, how now, uncle Gloucester!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Talking of hawking; nothing else, my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside to CARDINAL</em></p>
<span id='59'>Now, by God's mother, priest, I'll shave your crown for this,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Or all my fence shall fail.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Medice, teipsum&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Protector, see to't well, protect yourself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords.</span><br/>
<span id='64'>How irksome is this music to my heart!</span><br/>
<span id='65'>When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?</span><br/>
<span id='66'>I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Townsman of Saint Alban's, crying 'A miracle!'</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>What means this noise?</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>Townsman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>A miracle! a miracle!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Come to the king and tell him what miracle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>Townsman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Within this half-hour, hath received his sight;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>A man that ne'er saw in his life before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Now, God be praised, that to believing souls</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the Mayor of Saint Alban's and his  brethren, bearing SIMPCOX, between two in a chair, SIMPCOX's Wife following</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Here comes the townsmen on procession,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>To present your highness with the man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Stand by, my masters: bring him near the king;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>His highness' pleasure is to talk with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>That we for thee may glorify the Lord.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>What, hast thou been long blind and now restored?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Born blind, an't please your grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Wife</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Ay, indeed, was he.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>What woman is this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Wife</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>His wife, an't like your worship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have</span><br/>
<span id='90'>better told.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Where wert thou born?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>At Berwick in the north, an't like your grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>But still remember what the Lord hath done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Tell me, good fellow, camest thou here by chance,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>God knows, of pure devotion; being call'd</span><br/>
<span id='99'>A hundred times and oftener, in my sleep,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>By good Saint Alban; who said, 'Simpcox, come,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Wife</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Myself have heard a voice to call him so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>What, art thou lame?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Ay, God Almighty help me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>How camest thou so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>A fall off of a tree.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>Wife</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>A plum-tree, master.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>How long hast thou been blind?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Born so, master.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>       What, and wouldst climb a tree?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>But that in all my life, when I was a youth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>Wife</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Mass, thou lovedst plums well, that wouldst</span><br/>
<span id='115'>venture so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Alas,  good master, my wife desired some damsons,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And made me climb, with danger of my life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Let me see thine eyes: wink now: now open them:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>In my opinion yet thou seest not well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Saint Alban.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Red, master; red as blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Why, that's well said. What colour is my gown of?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Black, forsooth: coal-black as jet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>And yet, I think, jet did he never see.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>But cloaks and gowns, before this day, a many.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>Wife</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Never, before this day, in all his life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Tell me, sirrah, what's my name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Alas, master, I know not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>What's his name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>I know not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Nor his?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>No, indeed, master.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>What's thine own name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Then, Saunder, sit there, the lyingest knave in</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou</span><br/>
<span id='141'>mightest as well have known all our names as thus to</span><br/>
<span id='142'>name the several colours we do wear. Sight may</span><br/>
<span id='143'>distinguish of colours, but suddenly to nominate them</span><br/>
<span id='144'>all, it is impossible. My lords, Saint Alban here</span><br/>
<span id='145'>hath done a miracle; and would ye not think his</span><br/>
<span id='146'>cunning to be great, that could restore this cripple</span><br/>
<span id='147'>to his legs again?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>O master, that you could!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>My masters of Saint Alban's, have you not beadles in</span><br/>
<span id='150'>your town, and things called whips?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>Mayor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Yes, my lord, if it please your grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Then send for one presently.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>Mayor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit an Attendant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Now fetch me a stool hither by and by. Now, sirrah,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>if you mean to save yourself from whipping, leap me</span><br/>
<span id='156'>over this stool and run away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone:</span><br/>
<span id='158'>You go about to torture me in vain.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Beadle with whips</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Well, sir, we must have you find your legs. Sirrah</span><br/>
<span id='160'>beadle, whip him till he leap over that same stool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech89'><strong>Beadle</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>I will, my lord. Come on, sirrah; off with your</span><br/>
<span id='162'>doublet quickly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech90'><strong>SIMPCOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.</span><br/>
<p><em>After the Beadle hath hit him once, he leaps over the stool and runs away; and they follow and cry, 'A miracle!'</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech91'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech92'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>It made me laugh to see the villain run.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech93'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Follow the knave; and take this drab away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech94'><strong>Wife</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>Alas, sir, we did it for pure need.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech95'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Let them be whipped through every market-town, till</span><br/>
<span id='169'>they come to Berwick, from whence they came.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Wife, Beadle, Mayor,  & c</em></p>

<span id='speech96'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech97'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>True; made the lame to leap and fly away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech98'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>But you have done more miracles than I;</span><br/>
<span id='173'>You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BUCKINGHAM</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech99'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech100'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>

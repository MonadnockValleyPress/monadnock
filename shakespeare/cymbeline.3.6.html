<em>Enter IMOGEN, in boy's clothes</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I see a man's life is a tedious one:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>I have tired myself, and for two nights together</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>But that my resolution helps me. Milford,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me</span><br/>
<span id='9'>I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis</span><br/>
<span id='11'>A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>My hunger's gone; but even before, I was</span><br/>
<span id='17'>At point to sink for food. But what is this?</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I were best not to call; I dare not call:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>yet famine,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?</span><br/>
<span id='24'>If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Best draw my sword: and if mine enemy</span><br/>
<span id='27'>But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Such a foe, good heavens!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit, to the cave</em></p>
<p><em>Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>You, Polydote, have proved best woodman and</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Are master of the feast: Cadwal and I</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>The sweat of industry would dry and die,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachs</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Will make what's homely savoury: weariness</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Poor house, that keep'st thyself!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>I am thoroughly weary.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>There is cold meat i' the cave; we'll browse on that,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>[Looking into the cave]</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Stay; come not in.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>But that it eats our victuals, I should think</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Here were a fairy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>What's the matter, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>An earthly paragon! Behold divineness</span><br/>
<span id='49'>No elder than a boy!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter IMOGEN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Good masters, harm me not:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Before I enter'd here, I call'd; and thought</span><br/>
<span id='52'>To have begg'd or bought what I have took: good troth,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>I would have left it on the board so soon</span><br/>
<span id='56'>As I had made my meal, and parted</span><br/>
<span id='57'>With prayers for the provider.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Money, youth?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!</span><br/>
<span id='60'>As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Who worship dirty gods.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I see you're angry:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Have died had I not made it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Whither bound?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>To Milford-Haven.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>What's your name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>I am fall'n in this offence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Prithee, fair youth,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds</span><br/>
<span id='74'>By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!</span><br/>
<span id='75'>'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheer</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Ere you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Boys, bid him welcome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Were you a woman, youth,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I bid for you as I'd buy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>I'll make't my comfort</span><br/>
<span id='82'>He is a man; I'll love him as my brother:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And such a welcome as I'd give to him</span><br/>
<span id='84'>After long absence, such is yours: most welcome!</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>'Mongst friends,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>If brothers.</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='88'>Would it had been so, that they</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Had been my father's sons! then had my prize</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Been less, and so more equal ballasting</span><br/>
<span id='91'>To thee, Posthumus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>He wrings at some distress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Would I could free't!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Or I, whate'er it be,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>What pain it cost, what danger. God's!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Hark, boys.</span><br/>
<p><em>Whispering</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Great men,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>That had a court no bigger than this cave,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>That did attend themselves and had the virtue</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Which their own conscience seal'd them&mdash;laying by</span><br/>
<span id='101'>That nothing-gift of differing multitudes&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!</span><br/>
<span id='103'>I'd change my sex to be companion with them,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Since Leonatus's false.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>It shall be so.</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp'd,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>So far as thou wilt speak it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Pray, draw near.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>The night to the owl and morn to the lark</span><br/>
<span id='112'>less welcome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Thanks, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>I pray, draw near.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

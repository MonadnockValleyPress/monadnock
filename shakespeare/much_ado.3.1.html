<h1>Much Ado About Nothing</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Leonato's garden.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Proposing with the prince and Claudio:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And bid her steal into the pleached bower,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Made proud by princes, that advance their pride</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>To listen our purpose.  This is thy office;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>As we do trace this alley up and down,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Our talk must only be of Benedick.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>When I do name him, let it be thy part</span><br/>
<span id='19'>To praise him more than ever man did merit:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>My talk to thee must be how Benedick</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>That only wounds by hearsay.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BEATRICE, behind</em></p>
<span id='24'>Now begin;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Close by the ground, to hear our conference.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>URSULA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And greedily devour the treacherous bait:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>So angle we for Beatrice; who even now</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Is couched in the woodbine coverture.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Fear you not my part of the dialogue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Approaching the bower</em></p>
<span id='35'>No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>I know her spirits are as coy and wild</span><br/>
<span id='37'>As haggerds of the rock.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>URSULA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>But are you sure</span><br/>
<span id='39'>That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>URSULA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>To wish him wrestle with affection,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And never to let Beatrice know of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>URSULA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Deserve as full as fortunate a bed</span><br/>
<span id='48'>As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>O god of love! I know he doth deserve</span><br/>
<span id='50'>As much as may be yielded to a man:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>But Nature never framed a woman's heart</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Misprising what they look on, and her wit</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Values itself so highly that to her</span><br/>
<span id='56'>All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Nor take no shape nor project of affection,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>She is so self-endeared.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>URSULA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Sure, I think so;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And therefore certainly it were not good</span><br/>
<span id='61'>She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>If low, an agate very vilely cut;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>If silent, why, a block moved with none.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>So turns she every man the wrong side out</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And never gives to truth and virtue that</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>URSULA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>No, not to be so odd and from all fashions</span><br/>
<span id='76'>As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Out of myself, press me to death with wit.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>It were a better death than die with mocks,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Which is as bad as die with tickling.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>URSULA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>No; rather I will go to Benedick</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And counsel him to fight against his passion.</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders</span><br/>
<span id='88'>To stain my cousin with: one doth not know</span><br/>
<span id='89'>How much an ill word may empoison liking.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>URSULA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>She cannot be so much without true judgment&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Having so swift and excellent a wit</span><br/>
<span id='93'>As she is prized to have&mdash;as to refuse</span><br/>
<span id='94'>So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>He is the only man of Italy.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Always excepted my dear Claudio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>URSULA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Goes foremost in report through Italy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>URSULA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.</span><br/>
<span id='103'>When are you married, madam?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>URSULA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt HERO and URSULA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>[Coming forward]</span><br/>
<span id='111'>What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!</span><br/>
<span id='114'>No glory lives behind the back of such.</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee</span><br/>
<span id='118'>To bind our loves up in a holy band;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>For others say thou dost deserve, and I</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Believe it better than reportingly.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

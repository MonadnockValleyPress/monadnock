<h1>A Midsummer Night's Dream</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</H3>
<h4>Athens. The palace of Theseus.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, Lords and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>'Tis strange my Theseus, that these</span><br/>
<span id='2'>lovers speak of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>More strange than true: I never may believe</span><br/>
<span id='4'>These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend</span><br/>
<span id='7'>More than cool reason ever comprehends.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>The lunatic, the lover and the poet</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Are of imagination all compact:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And as imagination bodies forth</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing</span><br/>
<span id='18'>A local habitation and a name.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Such tricks hath strong imagination,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>That if it would but apprehend some joy,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>It comprehends some bringer of that joy;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Or in the night, imagining some fear,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>How easy is a bush supposed a bear!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>But all the story of the night told over,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And all their minds transfigured so together,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>More witnesseth than fancy's images</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And grows to something of great constancy;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>But, howsoever, strange and admirable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA</em></p>
<span id='30'>Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Accompany your hearts!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>More than to us</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>To wear away this long age of three hours</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Between our after-supper and bed-time?</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Where is our usual manager of mirth?</span><br/>
<span id='38'>What revels are in hand? Is there no play,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Call Philostrate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PHILOSTRATE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>                  Here, mighty Theseus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?</span><br/>
<span id='43'>What masque? what music? How shall we beguile</span><br/>
<span id='44'>The lazy time, if not with some delight?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PHILOSTRATE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>There is a brief how many sports are ripe:</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Make choice of which your highness will see first.</span><br/>
<p><em>Giving a paper</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>[Reads]  'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung</span><br/>
<span id='48'>By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'</span><br/>
<span id='49'>We'll none of that: that have I told my love,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>In glory of my kinsman Hercules.</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='51'>'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'</span><br/>
<span id='53'>That is an old device; and it was play'd</span><br/>
<span id='54'>When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='55'>'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'</span><br/>
<span id='57'>That is some satire, keen and critical,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='59'>'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!</span><br/>
<span id='62'>That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>How shall we find the concord of this discord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PHILOSTRATE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Which is as brief as I have known a play;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Which makes it tedious; for in all the play</span><br/>
<span id='68'>There is not one word apt, one player fitted:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And tragical, my noble lord, it is;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears</span><br/>
<span id='73'>The passion of loud laughter never shed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>What are they that do play it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PHILOSTRATE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Which never labour'd in their minds till now,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories</span><br/>
<span id='78'>With this same play, against your nuptial.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>And we will hear it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PHILOSTRATE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>No, my noble lord;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>It is not for you: I have heard it over,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And it is nothing, nothing in the world;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Unless you can find sport in their intents,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>To do you service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>                  I will hear that play;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>For never anything can be amiss,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>When simpleness and duty tender it.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit PHILOSTRATE</em></p>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></a>

<span id='90'>I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And duty in his service perishing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></a>

<span id='93'>He says they can do nothing in this kind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Takes it in might, not merit.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Where I have come, great clerks have purposed</span><br/>
<span id='99'>To greet me with premeditated welcomes;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Make periods in the midst of sentences,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Throttle their practised accent in their fears</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And in the modesty of fearful duty</span><br/>
<span id='107'>I read as much as from the rattling tongue</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Of saucy and audacious eloquence.</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity</span><br/>
<span id='110'>In least speak most, to my capacity.</span><br/>

<span id='113'>If we offend, it is with our good will.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>That you should think, we come not to offend,</span><br/>

<span id='116'>That is the true beginning of our end.</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Consider then we come but in despite.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>We do not come as minding to contest you,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Our true intent is. All for your delight</span><br/>

<span id='121'>The actors are at hand and by their show</span><br/>
<span id='122'>You shall know all that you are like to know.</span><br/>

<span id='123'>This fellow doth not stand upon points.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows</span><br/>
<span id='125'>not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not</span><br/>
<span id='126'>enough to speak, but to speak true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child</span><br/>
<span id='128'>on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.</span><br/>

<span id='129'>His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing</span><br/>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Prologue</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.</span><br/>
<span id='133'>This man is Pyramus, if you would know;</span><br/>
<span id='134'>This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.</span><br/>
<span id='135'>This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;</span><br/>
<span id='137'>And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content</span><br/>
<span id='138'>To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.</span><br/>
<span id='139'>This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn</span><br/>
<span id='142'>To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.</span><br/>
<span id='143'>This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Did scare away, or rather did affright;</span><br/>
<span id='146'>And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain</span><br/>
<span id='155'>At large discourse, while here they do remain.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine</em></p>

<span id='speech29'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>

<span id='156'>I wonder if the lion be to speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>Wall</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>In this same interlude it doth befall</span><br/>
<span id='159'>That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>And such a wall, as I would have you think,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>That had in it a crannied hole or chink,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Did whisper often very secretly.</span><br/>
<span id='164'>This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show</span><br/>
<span id='165'>That I am that same wall; the truth is so:</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And this the cranny is, right and sinister,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard</span><br/>
<span id='170'>discourse, my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Pyramus</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!</span><br/>

<span id='172'>O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!</span><br/>
<span id='173'>O night, which ever art when day is not!</span><br/>
<span id='174'>O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!</span><br/>
<span id='176'>And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!</span><br/>
<p><em>Wall holds up his fingers</em></p>
<span id='180'>Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!</span><br/>
<span id='181'>But what see I? No Thisby do I see.</span><br/>
<span id='182'>O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>Pyramus</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'</span><br/>
<span id='186'>is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to</span><br/>
<span id='187'>spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will</span><br/>
<span id='188'>fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Thisbe</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>Thisbe</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>For parting my fair Pyramus and me!</span><br/>
<span id='191'>My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>Pyramus</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>I see a voice: now will I to the chink,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!</span><br/>

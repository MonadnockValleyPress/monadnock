<h1>Henry IV, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</H3>
<h4>London. The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR, SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>My blood hath been too cold and temperate,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Unapt to stir at these indignities,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And you have found me; for accordingly</span><br/>
<span id='4'>You tread upon my patience: but be sure</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I will from henceforth rather be myself,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And therefore lost that title of respect</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves</span><br/>
<span id='11'>The scourge of greatness to be used on it;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And that same greatness too which our own hands</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Have holp to make so portly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>My lord.&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Danger and disobedience in thine eye:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And majesty might never yet endure</span><br/>
<span id='19'>The moody frontier of a servant brow.</span><br/>
<span id='20'>You have good leave to leave us: when we need</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Worcester</em></p>
<span id='22'>You were about to speak.</span><br/>
<p><em>To North</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Yea, my good lord.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Were, as he says, not with such strength denied</span><br/>
<span id='27'>As is deliver'd to your majesty:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Either envy, therefore, or misprison</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Is guilty of this fault and not my son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>My liege, I did deny no prisoners.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>But I remember, when the fight was done,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>He was perfumed like a milliner;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held</span><br/>
<span id='39'>A pouncet-box, which ever and anon</span><br/>
<span id='40'>He gave his nose and took't away again;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Who therewith angry, when it next came there,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Betwixt the wind and his nobility.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>With many holiday and lady terms</span><br/>
<span id='48'>He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded</span><br/>
<span id='49'>My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>To be so pester'd with a popinjay,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Out of my grief and my impatience,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>He should or he should not; for he made me mad</span><br/>
<span id='55'>To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Of guns and drums and wounds,&mdash;God save the mark!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And that it was great pity, so it was,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd</span><br/>
<span id='64'>So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>He would himself have been a soldier.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>I answer'd indirectly, as I said;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And I beseech you, let not his report</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Come current for an accusation</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Betwixt my love and your high majesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SIR WALTER BLUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said</span><br/>
<span id='73'>To such a person and in such a place,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>At such a time, with all the rest retold,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>May reasonably die and never rise</span><br/>
<span id='76'>To do him wrong or any way impeach</span><br/>
<span id='77'>What then he said, so he unsay it now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>But with proviso and exception,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>That we at our own charge shall ransom straight</span><br/>
<span id='81'>His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd</span><br/>
<span id='83'>The lives of those that he did lead to fight</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>When they have lost and forfeited themselves?</span><br/>
<span id='90'>No, on the barren mountains let him starve;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>For I shall never hold that man my friend</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost</span><br/>
<span id='93'>To ransom home revolted Mortimer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Revolted Mortimer!</span><br/>
<span id='95'>He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>But by the chance of war; to prove that true</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took</span><br/>
<span id='99'>When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>In single opposition, hand to hand,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>He did confound the best part of an hour</span><br/>
<span id='102'>In changing hardiment with great Glendower:</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Three times they breathed and three times did</span><br/>
<span id='104'>they drink,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Never did base and rotten policy</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Colour her working with such deadly wounds;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Nor could the noble Mortimer</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Receive so many, and all willingly:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>He never did encounter with Glendower:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>I tell thee,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>He durst as well have met the devil alone</span><br/>
<span id='119'>As Owen Glendower for an enemy.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Or you shall hear in such a kind from me</span><br/>
<span id='124'>As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>We licence your departure with your son.</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>An if the devil come and roar for them,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>I will not send them: I will after straight</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Albeit I make a hazard of my head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Here comes your uncle.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter WORCESTER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Speak of Mortimer!</span><br/>
<span id='134'>'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Want mercy, if I do not join with him:</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer</span><br/>
<span id='139'>As high in the air as this unthankful king,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Who struck this heat up after I was gone?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;</span><br/>
<span id='144'>And when I urged the ransom once again</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd</span><br/>
<span id='149'>By Richard that dead is the next of blood?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>He was; I heard the proclamation:</span><br/>
<span id='151'>And then it was when the unhappy king,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>&mdash;Whose wrongs in us God pardon!&mdash;did set forth</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Upon his Irish expedition;</span><br/>
<span id='154'>From whence he intercepted did return</span><br/>
<span id='155'>To be deposed and shortly murdered.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Live scandalized and foully spoken of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Heir to the crown?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>He did; myself did hear it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>That wished him on the barren mountains starve.</span><br/>
<span id='164'>But shall it be that you, that set the crown</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Upon the head of this forgetful man</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And for his sake wear the detested blot</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Of murderous subornation, shall it be,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>That you a world of curses undergo,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Being the agents, or base second means,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?</span><br/>
<span id='171'>O, pardon me that I descend so low,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>To show the line and the predicament</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Wherein you range under this subtle king;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Or fill up chronicles in time to come,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>That men of your nobility and power</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>As both of you&mdash;God pardon it!&mdash;have done,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?</span><br/>
<span id='181'>And shall it in more shame be further spoken,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off</span><br/>
<span id='183'>By him for whom these shames ye underwent?</span><br/>
<span id='184'>No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Into the good thoughts of the world again,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Of this proud king, who studies day and night</span><br/>
<span id='189'>To answer all the debt he owes to you</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Therefore, I say&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>                  Peace, cousin, say no more:</span><br/>
<span id='193'>And now I will unclasp a secret book,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>And to your quick-conceiving discontents</span><br/>
<span id='195'>I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>As full of peril and adventurous spirit</span><br/>
<span id='197'>As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud</span><br/>
<span id='198'>On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Send danger from the east unto the west,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>So honour cross it from the north to south,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs</span><br/>
<span id='203'>To rouse a lion than to start a hare!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>Imagination of some great exploit</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Or dive into the bottom of the deep,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;</span><br/>
<span id='211'>So he that doth redeem her thence might wear</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Without corrival, all her dignities:</span><br/>
<span id='213'>But out upon this half-faced fellowship!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>He apprehends a world of figures here,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>But not the form of what he should attend.</span><br/>
<span id='216'>Good cousin, give me audience for a while.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>I cry you mercy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>                  Those same noble Scots</span><br/>
<span id='219'>That are your prisoners,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='220'>I'll keep them all;</span><br/>
<span id='221'>By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;</span><br/>
<span id='222'>No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:</span><br/>
<span id='223'>I'll keep them, by this hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='224'>You start away</span><br/>
<span id='225'>And lend no ear unto my purposes.</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Those prisoners you shall keep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='227'>Nay, I will; that's flat:</span><br/>
<span id='228'>He said he would not ransom Mortimer;</span><br/>
<span id='229'>Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;</span><br/>
<span id='230'>But I will find him when he lies asleep,</span><br/>
<span id='231'>And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'</span><br/>
<span id='232'>Nay,</span><br/>
<span id='233'>I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak</span><br/>
<span id='234'>Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him</span><br/>
<span id='235'>To keep his anger still in motion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='236'>Hear you, cousin; a word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='237'>All studies here I solemnly defy,</span><br/>
<span id='238'>Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:</span><br/>
<span id='239'>And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,</span><br/>
<span id='240'>But that I think his father loves him not</span><br/>
<span id='241'>And would be glad he met with some mischance,</span><br/>
<span id='242'>I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>

<span id='243'>Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you</span><br/>
<span id='244'>When you are better temper'd to attend.</span><br/>

<span id='speech36'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>

<span id='245'>Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool</span><br/>
<span id='246'>Art thou to break into this woman's mood,</span><br/>
<span id='247'>Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='248'>Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,</span><br/>
<span id='249'>Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear</span><br/>
<span id='250'>Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.</span><br/>
<span id='251'>In Richard's time,&mdash;what do you call the place?&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='252'>A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;</span><br/>
<span id='253'>'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,</span><br/>
<span id='254'>His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee</span><br/>
<span id='255'>Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='256'>'Sblood!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='257'>When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.</span><br/>

<span id='274'>Will easily be granted. You, my lord,</span><br/>

<span id='282'>I speak not this in estimation,</span><br/>
<span id='283'>As what I think might be, but what I know</span><br/>

<span id='289'>Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot;</span><br/>

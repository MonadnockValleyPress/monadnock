<span id='1'>The king he is hunting the deer; I am coursing</span><br/>
<span id='2'>myself: they have pitched a toil; I am toiling in</span><br/>
<span id='3'>a pitch,&mdash;pitch that defiles: defile! a foul</span><br/>
<span id='4'>word. Well, set thee down, sorrow! for so they say</span><br/>
<span id='5'>the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool: well</span><br/>
<span id='6'>proved, wit! By the Lord, this love is as mad as</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Ajax: it kills sheep; it kills me, I a sheep:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>well proved again o' my side! I will not love: if</span><br/>
<span id='9'>I do, hang me; i' faith, I will not. O, but her</span><br/>
<span id='10'>eye,&mdash;by this light, but for her eye, I would not</span><br/>
<span id='11'>love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing</span><br/>
<span id='12'>in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By</span><br/>
<span id='13'>heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme</span><br/>
<span id='14'>and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my</span><br/>
<span id='16'>sonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sent</span><br/>
<span id='17'>it, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeter</span><br/>
<span id='18'>fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care</span><br/>
<span id='19'>a pin, if the other three were in. Here comes one</span><br/>
<span id='20'>with a paper: God give him grace to groan!</span><br/>
<p><em>Stands aside</em></p>
<p><em>Enter FERDINAND, with a paper</em></p>

<span id='22'>[Aside]  Shot, by heaven! Proceed, sweet Cupid:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>thou hast thumped him with thy bird-bolt under the</span><br/>
<span id='24'>left pap. In faith, secrets!</span><br/>

<span id='25'>[Reads]</span><br/>
<span id='26'>So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not</span><br/>
<span id='27'>To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote</span><br/>
<span id='29'>The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Through the transparent bosom of the deep,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>As doth thy face through tears of mine give light;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Do but behold the tears that swell in me,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And they thy glory through my grief will show:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep</span><br/>
<span id='39'>My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.</span><br/>
<span id='42'>How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Steps aside</em></p>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>

<span id='51'>I could put thee in comfort. Not by two that I know:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LONGAVILLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>O sweet Maria, empress of my love!</span><br/>
<span id='56'>These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.</span><br/>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>

<span id='57'>O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Disfigure not his slop.</span><br/>

<span id='59'>This same shall go.</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='60'>Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Persuade my heart to this false perjury?</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.</span><br/>
<span id='64'>A woman I forswore; but I will prove,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Exhalest this vapour-vow; in thee it is:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>If broken then, it is no fault of mine:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>If by me broke, what fool is not so wise</span><br/>
<span id='73'>To lose an oath to win a paradise?</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='301'>'Tis more than need.</span><br/>
<span id='302'>Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.</span><br/>
<span id='303'>Consider what you first did swear unto,</span><br/>
<span id='304'>To fast, to study, and to see no woman;</span><br/>
<span id='305'>Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.</span><br/>
<span id='306'>Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;</span><br/>
<span id='307'>And abstinence engenders maladies.</span><br/>
<span id='308'>And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,</span><br/>
<span id='309'>In that each of you have forsworn his book,</span><br/>
<span id='310'>Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?</span><br/>
<span id='311'>For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,</span><br/>
<span id='312'>Have found the ground of study's excellence</span><br/>
<span id='313'>Without the beauty of a woman's face?</span><br/>
<p><em>From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;  They are the ground, the books, the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire</em></p>
<span id='314'>Why, universal plodding poisons up</span><br/>
<span id='315'>The nimble spirits in the arteries,</span><br/>
<span id='316'>As motion and long-during action tires</span><br/>
<span id='317'>The sinewy vigour of the traveller.</span><br/>
<span id='318'>Now, for not looking on a woman's face,</span><br/>
<span id='319'>You have in that forsworn the use of eyes</span><br/>
<span id='320'>And study too, the causer of your vow;</span><br/>
<span id='321'>For where is any author in the world</span><br/>
<span id='322'>Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?</span><br/>
<span id='323'>Learning is but an adjunct to ourself</span><br/>
<span id='324'>And where we are our learning likewise is:</span><br/>
<span id='325'>Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='326'>Do we not likewise see our learning there?</span><br/>
<span id='327'>O, we have made a vow to study, lords,</span><br/>
<span id='328'>And in that vow we have forsworn our books.</span><br/>
<span id='329'>For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,</span><br/>
<span id='330'>In leaden contemplation have found out</span><br/>
<span id='331'>Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes</span><br/>
<span id='332'>Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?</span><br/>
<span id='333'>Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;</span><br/>
<span id='334'>And therefore, finding barren practisers,</span><br/>
<span id='335'>Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:</span><br/>
<span id='336'>But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='337'>Lives not alone immured in the brain;</span><br/>
<span id='338'>But, with the motion of all elements,</span><br/>
<span id='339'>Courses as swift as thought in every power,</span><br/>
<span id='340'>And gives to every power a double power,</span><br/>
<span id='341'>Above their functions and their offices.</span><br/>
<span id='342'>It adds a precious seeing to the eye;</span><br/>
<span id='343'>A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;</span><br/>
<span id='344'>A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,</span><br/>
<span id='345'>When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:</span><br/>
<span id='346'>Love's feeling is more soft and sensible</span><br/>
<span id='347'>Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;</span><br/>
<span id='348'>Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:</span><br/>
<span id='349'>For valour, is not Love a Hercules,</span><br/>
<span id='350'>Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?</span><br/>
<span id='351'>Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical</span><br/>
<span id='352'>As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:</span><br/>
<span id='353'>And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods</span><br/>
<span id='354'>Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.</span><br/>
<span id='355'>Never durst poet touch a pen to write</span><br/>
<span id='356'>Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;</span><br/>
<span id='357'>O, then his lines would ravish savage ears</span><br/>
<span id='358'>And plant in tyrants mild humility.</span><br/>
<span id='359'>From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:</span><br/>
<span id='360'>They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;</span><br/>
<span id='361'>They are the books, the arts, the academes,</span><br/>
<span id='362'>That show, contain and nourish all the world:</span><br/>
<span id='363'>Else none at all in ought proves excellent.</span><br/>
<span id='364'>Then fools you were these women to forswear,</span><br/>
<span id='365'>Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.</span><br/>
<span id='366'>For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,</span><br/>
<span id='367'>Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,</span><br/>
<span id='368'>Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,</span><br/>
<span id='369'>Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,</span><br/>
<span id='370'>Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,</span><br/>
<span id='371'>Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.</span><br/>
<span id='372'>It is religion to be thus forsworn,</span><br/>
<span id='373'>For charity itself fulfills the law,</span><br/>
<span id='374'>And who can sever love from charity?</span><br/>

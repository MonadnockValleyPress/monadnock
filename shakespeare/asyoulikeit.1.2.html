<blockquote>
<em>Enter CELIA and ROSALIND</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could</span><br/>
<span id='4'>teach me to forget a banished father, you must not</span><br/>
<span id='5'>learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight</span><br/>
<span id='7'>that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou</span><br/>
<span id='9'>hadst been still with me, I could have taught my</span><br/>
<span id='10'>love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously</span><br/>
<span id='12'>tempered as mine is to thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to</span><br/>
<span id='14'>rejoice in yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is</span><br/>
<span id='16'>like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt</span><br/>
<span id='17'>be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy</span><br/>
<span id='18'>father perforce, I will render thee again in</span><br/>
<span id='19'>affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break</span><br/>
<span id='20'>that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my</span><br/>
<span id='21'>sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let</span><br/>
<span id='23'>me see; what think you of falling in love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but</span><br/>
<span id='25'>love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport</span><br/>
<span id='26'>neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst</span><br/>
<span id='27'>in honour come off again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>What shall be our sport, then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from</span><br/>
<span id='30'>her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>I would we could do so, for her benefits are</span><br/>
<span id='32'>mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman</span><br/>
<span id='33'>doth most mistake in her gifts to women.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce</span><br/>
<span id='35'>makes honest, and those that she makes honest she</span><br/>
<span id='36'>makes very ill-favouredly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>not in the lineaments of Nature.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter TOUCHSTONE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she</span><br/>
<span id='41'>not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature</span><br/>
<span id='42'>hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Nature's wit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull</span><br/>
<span id='49'>to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this</span><br/>
<span id='50'>natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of</span><br/>
<span id='51'>the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>wit! whither wander you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Mistress, you must come away to your father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Were you made the messenger?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Where learned you that oath, fool?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they</span><br/>
<span id='58'>were good pancakes and swore by his honour the</span><br/>
<span id='59'>mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the</span><br/>
<span id='60'>pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and</span><br/>
<span id='61'>yet was not the knight forsworn.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>How prove you that, in the great heap of your</span><br/>
<span id='63'>knowledge?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and</span><br/>
<span id='66'>swear by your beards that I am a knave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>By our beards, if we had them, thou art.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you</span><br/>
<span id='69'>swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no</span><br/>
<span id='70'>more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he</span><br/>
<span id='71'>never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away</span><br/>
<span id='72'>before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>One that old Frederick, your father, loves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!</span><br/>
<span id='76'>speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation</span><br/>
<span id='77'>one of these days.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what</span><br/>
<span id='79'>wise men do foolishly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little</span><br/>
<span id='81'>wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery</span><br/>
<span id='82'>that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Monsieur Le Beau.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>With his mouth full of news.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Then shall we be news-crammed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>All the better; we shall be the more marketable.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LE BEAU</em></p>
<span id='88'>Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>LE BEAU</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Sport! of what colour?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>LE BEAU</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>As wit and fortune will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Or as the Destinies decree.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Nay, if I keep not my rank,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Thou losest thy old smell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LE BEAU</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good</span><br/>
<span id='98'>wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>You tell us the manner of the wrestling.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LE BEAU</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please</span><br/>
<span id='101'>your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is</span><br/>
<span id='102'>yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming</span><br/>
<span id='103'>to perform it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LE BEAU</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>There comes an old man and his three sons,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>I could match this beginning with an old tale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LE BEAU</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men</span><br/>
<span id='109'>by these presents.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>LE BEAU</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the</span><br/>
<span id='111'>duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him</span><br/>
<span id='112'>and broke three of his ribs, that there is little</span><br/>
<span id='113'>hope of life in him: so he served the second, and</span><br/>
<span id='114'>so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>their father, making such pitiful dole over them</span><br/>
<span id='116'>that all the beholders take his part with weeping.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Alas!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies</span><br/>
<span id='119'>have lost?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>LE BEAU</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Why, this that I speak of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first</span><br/>
<span id='122'>time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport</span><br/>
<span id='123'>for ladies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Or I, I promise thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>But is there any else longs to see this broken music</span><br/>
<span id='126'>in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon</span><br/>
<span id='127'>rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>LE BEAU</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>You must, if you stay here; for here is the place</span><br/>
<span id='129'>appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to</span><br/>
<span id='130'>perform it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>DUKE FREDERICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his</span><br/>
<span id='133'>own peril on his forwardness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Is yonder the man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>LE BEAU</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Even he, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>DUKE FREDERICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither</span><br/>
<span id='138'>to see the wrestling?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>DUKE FREDERICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>there is such odds in the man. In pity of the</span><br/>
<span id='142'>challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he</span><br/>
<span id='143'>will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if</span><br/>
<span id='144'>you can move him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>DUKE FREDERICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Do so: I'll not be by.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>LE BEAU</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>I attend them with all respect and duty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I</span><br/>
<span id='151'>come but in, as others do, to try with him the</span><br/>
<span id='152'>strength of my youth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your</span><br/>
<span id='154'>years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's</span><br/>
<span id='155'>strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or</span><br/>
<span id='156'>knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your</span><br/>
<span id='157'>adventure would counsel you to a more equal</span><br/>
<span id='158'>enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to</span><br/>
<span id='159'>embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore</span><br/>
<span id='161'>be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke</span><br/>
<span id='162'>that the wrestling might not go forward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>I beseech you, punish me not with your hard</span><br/>
<span id='164'>thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny</span><br/>
<span id='165'>so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let</span><br/>
<span id='166'>your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my</span><br/>
<span id='167'>trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one</span><br/>
<span id='168'>shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one</span><br/>
<span id='169'>dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my</span><br/>
<span id='170'>friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the</span><br/>
<span id='171'>world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in</span><br/>
<span id='172'>the world I fill up a place, which may be better</span><br/>
<span id='173'>supplied when I have made it empty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>And mine, to eke out hers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>Your heart's desires be with you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>Come, where is this young gallant that is so</span><br/>
<span id='179'>desirous to lie with his mother earth?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>DUKE FREDERICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>You shall try but one fall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him</span><br/>
<span id='183'>to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him</span><br/>
<span id='184'>from a first.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>An you mean to mock me after, you should not have</span><br/>
<span id='186'>mocked me before: but come your ways.</span><br/>

<span id='206'>Were I my father, coz, would I do this?</span><br/>

<span id='speech97'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>

<span id='207'>I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>His youngest son; and would not change that calling,</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech98'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>And all the world was of my father's mind:</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Had I before known this young man his son,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>I should have given him tears unto entreaties,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Ere he should thus have ventured.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='215'>Gentle cousin,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>Let us go thank him and encourage him:</span><br/>
<span id='217'>My father's rough and envious disposition</span><br/>
<span id='218'>Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:</span><br/>
<span id='219'>If you do keep your promises in love</span><br/>
<span id='220'>But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,</span><br/>
<span id='221'>Your mistress shall be happy.</span><br/>

<span id='222'>Gentleman,</span><br/>
<p><em>Giving him a chain from her neck</em></p>
<span id='223'>Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,</span><br/>
<span id='224'>That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Shall we go, coz?</span><br/>

<span id='241'>To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved</span><br/>

<span id='244'>That he misconstrues all that you have done.</span><br/>
<span id='245'>The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,</span><br/>

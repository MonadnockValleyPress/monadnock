<h1>Coriolanus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene VI</h3>
<h4>Antium. A public place.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, with Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Deliver them this paper: having read it,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Bid them repair to the market place; where I,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse</span><br/>
<span id='6'>The city ports by this hath enter'd and</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Intends to appear before the people, hoping</span><br/>
<span id='8'>To purge herself with words: dispatch.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Attendants</em></p>
<p><em>Enter three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS' faction</em></p>
<span id='9'>Most welcome!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Conspirator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>How is it with our general?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Even so</span><br/>
<span id='12'>As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And with his charity slain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Conspirator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Most noble sir,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>If you do hold the same intent wherein</span><br/>
<span id='16'>You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Of your great danger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Sir, I cannot tell:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>We must proceed as we do find the people.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Third Conspirator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>The people will remain uncertain whilst</span><br/>
<span id='21'>'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Makes the survivor heir of all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>I know it;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And my pretext to strike at him admits</span><br/>
<span id='25'>A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>He bow'd his nature, never known before</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But to be rough, unswayable and free.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Third Conspirator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Sir, his stoutness</span><br/>
<span id='32'>When he did stand for consul, which he lost</span><br/>
<span id='33'>By lack of stooping,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>That I would have spoke of:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way</span><br/>
<span id='38'>In all his own desires; nay, let him choose</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>My best and freshest men; served his designments</span><br/>
<span id='41'>In mine own person; holp to reap the fame</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Which he did end all his; and took some pride</span><br/>
<span id='43'>To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>I seem'd his follower, not partner, and</span><br/>
<span id='45'>He waged me with his countenance, as if</span><br/>
<span id='46'>I had been mercenary.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>First Conspirator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>So he did, my lord:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>When he had carried Rome and that we look'd</span><br/>
<span id='50'>For no less spoil than glory,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>There was it:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>At a few drops of women's rheum, which are</span><br/>
<span id='54'>As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Of our great action: therefore shall he die,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!</span><br/>
<p><em>Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the People</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>First Conspirator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Your native town you enter'd like a post,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And had no welcomes home: but he returns,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Splitting the air with noise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Second Conspirator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>And patient fools,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear</span><br/>
<span id='62'>With giving him glory.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Third Conspirator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Therefore, at your vantage,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Ere he express himself, or move the people</span><br/>
<span id='65'>With what he would say, let him feel your sword,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Which we will second. When he lies along,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>After your way his tale pronounced shall bury</span><br/>
<span id='68'>His reasons with his body.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Say no more:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Here come the lords.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the Lords of the city</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>All The Lords</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>You are most welcome home.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>I have not deserved it.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused</span><br/>
<span id='74'>What I have written to you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Lords</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>We have.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>And grieve to hear't.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>What faults he made before the last, I think</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Might have found easy fines: but there to end</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Where he was to begin and give away</span><br/>
<span id='80'>The benefit of our levies, answering us</span><br/>
<span id='81'>With our own charge, making a treaty where</span><br/>
<span id='82'>There was a yielding,&mdash;this admits no excuse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>He approaches: you shall hear him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours; commoners being with him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>No more infected with my country's love</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Under your great command. You are to know</span><br/>
<span id='88'>That prosperously I have attempted and</span><br/>
<span id='89'>With bloody passage led your wars even to</span><br/>
<span id='90'>The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Do more than counterpoise a full third part</span><br/>
<span id='92'>The charges of the action. We have made peace</span><br/>
<span id='93'>With no less honour to the Antiates</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Together with the seal o' the senate, what</span><br/>
<span id='97'>We have compounded on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Read it not, noble lords;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree</span><br/>
<span id='100'>He hath abused your powers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Traitor! how now!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>                  Ay, traitor, Marcius!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Marcius!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think</span><br/>
<span id='105'>I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Coriolanus in Corioli?</span><br/>
<span id='107'>You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously</span><br/>
<span id='108'>He has betray'd your business, and given up,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Breaking his oath and resolution like</span><br/>
<span id='112'>A twist of rotten silk, never admitting</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears</span><br/>
<span id='114'>He whined and roar'd away your victory,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>That pages blush'd at him and men of heart</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Look'd wondering each at other.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Hear'st thou, Mars?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Name not the god, thou boy of tears!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Ha!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>No more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever</span><br/>
<span id='124'>I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Must bear my beating to his grave&mdash;shall join</span><br/>
<span id='128'>To thrust the lie unto him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Peace, both, and hear me speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!</span><br/>
<span id='132'>If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Alone I did it. Boy!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Why, noble lords,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>'Fore your own eyes and ears?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>All Conspirators</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Let him die for't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>All The People</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd</span><br/>
<span id='142'>my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!</span><br/>
<span id='145'>The man is noble and his fame folds-in</span><br/>
<span id='146'>This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>And trouble not the peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>O that I had him,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>To use my lawful sword!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Insolent villain!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>All Conspirators</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!</span><br/>
<p><em>The Conspirators draw, and kill CORIOLANUS: AUFIDIUS stands on his body</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Lords</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Hold, hold, hold, hold!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>My noble masters, hear me speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>O Tullus,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>Third Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Put up your swords.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>AUFIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>My lords, when you shall know&mdash;as in this rage,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Provoked by him, you cannot&mdash;the great danger</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice</span><br/>
<span id='163'>That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours</span><br/>
<span id='164'>To call me to your senate, I'll deliver</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Myself your loyal servant, or endure</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Your heaviest censure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>Bear from hence his body;</span><br/>
<span id='168'>And mourn you for him: let him be regarded</span><br/>
<span id='169'>As the most noble corse that ever herald</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Did follow to his urn.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>His own impatience</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Let's make the best of it.</span><br/>

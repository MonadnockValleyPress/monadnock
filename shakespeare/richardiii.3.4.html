<h1>Richard III</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>The Tower of London.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, the BISHOP OF  ELY, RATCLIFF, LOVEL, with others, and take their seats at a table</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>My lords, at once: the cause why we are met</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Is, to determine of the coronation.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Are all things fitting for that royal time?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DERBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>It is, and wants but nomination.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BISHOP OF ELY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Who is most inward with the royal duke?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BISHOP OF ELY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Than I of yours;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>But, for his purpose in the coronation.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd</span><br/>
<span id='18'>His gracious pleasure any way therein:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>But you, my noble lords, may name the time;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GLOUCESTER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BISHOP OF ELY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>My absence doth neglect no great designs,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Which by my presence might have been concluded.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Had not you come upon your cue, my lord</span><br/>
<span id='28'>William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>I mean, your voice,&mdash;for crowning of the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I thank your grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>My lord of Ely!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BISHOP OF ELY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>My lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>When I was last in Holborn,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>I saw good strawberries in your garden there</span><br/>
<span id='37'>I do beseech you send for some of them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BISHOP OF ELY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Drawing him aside</em></p>
<span id='40'>Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And finds the testy gentleman so hot,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>As he will lose his head ere give consent</span><br/>
<span id='43'>His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM following</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DERBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>We have not yet set down this day of triumph.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>For I myself am not so well provided</span><br/>
<span id='49'>As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter BISHOP OF ELY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>BISHOP OF ELY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these</span><br/>
<span id='51'>strawberries.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>There's some conceit or other likes him well,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>I think there's never a man in Christendom</span><br/>
<span id='56'>That can less hide his love or hate than he;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>For by his face straight shall you know his heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DERBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>What of his heart perceive you in his face</span><br/>
<span id='59'>By any likelihood he show'd to-day?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Marry, that with no man here he is offended;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DERBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I pray God he be not, I say.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>I pray you all, tell me what they deserve</span><br/>
<span id='64'>That do conspire my death with devilish plots</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Upon my body with their hellish charms?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Makes me most forward in this noble presence</span><br/>
<span id='69'>To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be</span><br/>
<span id='70'>I say, my lord, they have deserved death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>If they have done this thing, my gracious lord&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>If I thou protector of this damned strumpet&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>I will not dine until I see the same.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but HASTINGS, RATCLIFF, and LOVEL</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>For I, too fond, might have prevented this.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>O, now I want the priest that spake to me:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>I now repent I told the pursuivant</span><br/>
<span id='93'>As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And I myself secure in grace and favour.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>RATCLIFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>O momentary grace of mortal men,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Ready, with every nod, to tumble down</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Into the fatal bowels of the deep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LOVEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>O bloody Richard! miserable England!</span><br/>
<span id='108'>I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee</span><br/>
<span id='109'>That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>The Tempest</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Another part of the island.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>So have we all, of joy; for our escape</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Is common; every day some sailor's wife,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>The masters of some merchant and the merchant</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>I mean our preservation, few in millions</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Our sorrow with our comfort.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ALONSO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Prithee, peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>He receives comfort like cold porridge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>The visitor will not give him o'er so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>by and by it will strike.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Sir,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>One: tell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Comes to the entertainer&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>A dollar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Dolour comes to him, indeed: you</span><br/>
<span id='21'>have spoken truer than you purposed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Therefore, my lord,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ALONSO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>I prithee, spare.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Well, I have done: but yet,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>He will be talking.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Which, of he or Adrian, for a good</span><br/>
<span id='29'>wager, first begins to crow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>The old cock.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>The cockerel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Done. The wager?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>A laughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>A match!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ADRIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Though this island seem to be desert,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ADRIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Yet,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ADRIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Yet,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>He could not miss't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ADRIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate</span><br/>
<span id='42'>temperance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Temperance was a delicate wench.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>ADRIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>As if it had lungs and rotten ones.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Here is everything advantageous to life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>True; save means to live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Of that there's none, or little.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>The ground indeed is tawny.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>With an eye of green in't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>He misses not much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>But the rarity of it is,&mdash;which is indeed almost</span><br/>
<span id='57'>beyond credit,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>As many vouched rarities are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in</span><br/>
<span id='60'>the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and</span><br/>
<span id='61'>glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with</span><br/>
<span id='62'>salt water.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not</span><br/>
<span id='64'>say he lies?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we</span><br/>
<span id='67'>put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of</span><br/>
<span id='68'>the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>ADRIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to</span><br/>
<span id='71'>their queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Not since widow Dido's time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?</span><br/>
<span id='74'>widow Dido!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>how you take it!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>ADRIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>ADRIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Carthage?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>I assure you, Carthage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath</span><br/>
<span id='83'>raised the wall and houses too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>What impossible matter will he make easy next?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>I think he will carry this island home in his pocket</span><br/>
<span id='86'>and give it his son for an apple.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring</span><br/>
<span id='88'>forth more islands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Ay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Why, in good time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now</span><br/>
<span id='92'>as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage</span><br/>
<span id='93'>of your daughter, who is now queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>And the rarest that e'er came there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I</span><br/>
<span id='98'>wore it? I mean, in a sort.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>That sort was well fished for.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>ALONSO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>You cram these words into mine ears against</span><br/>
<span id='102'>The stomach of my sense. Would I had never</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Who is so far from Italy removed</span><br/>
<span id='106'>I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Hath made his meal on thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>FRANCISCO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Sir, he may live:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>I saw him beat the surges under him,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted</span><br/>
<span id='113'>The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head</span><br/>
<span id='114'>'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke</span><br/>
<span id='116'>To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt</span><br/>
<span id='118'>He came alive to land.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>ALONSO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>No, no, he's gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>But rather lose her to an African;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>ALONSO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Prithee, peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise</span><br/>
<span id='127'>By all of us, and the fair soul herself</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your</span><br/>
<span id='130'>son,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have</span><br/>
<span id='132'>More widows in them of this business' making</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Than we bring men to comfort them:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>The fault's your own.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>ALONSO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>So is the dear'st o' the loss.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>My lord Sebastian,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness</span><br/>
<span id='138'>And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>When you should bring the plaster.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Very well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>And most chirurgeonly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>It is foul weather in us all, good sir,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>When you are cloudy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Foul weather?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Very foul.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Or docks, or mallows.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>And were the king on't, what would I do?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>'Scape being drunk for want of wine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech89'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>I' the commonwealth I would by contraries</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Execute all things; for no kind of traffic</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Would I admit; no name of magistrate;</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>And use of service, none; contract, succession,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>No occupation; all men idle, all;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And women too, but innocent and pure;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>No sovereignty;&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech90'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>                  Yet he would be king on't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech91'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the</span><br/>
<span id='163'>beginning.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech92'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>All things in common nature should produce</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>To feed my innocent people.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech93'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>No marrying 'mong his subjects?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech94'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech95'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>I would with such perfection govern, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>To excel the golden age.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech96'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>God save his majesty!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech97'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>Long live Gonzalo!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech98'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>                  And,&mdash;do you mark me, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech99'><strong>ALONSO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech100'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>I do well believe your highness; and</span><br/>
<span id='179'>did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that</span><br/>
<span id='181'>they always use to laugh at nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech101'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>'Twas you we laughed at.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech102'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing</span><br/>
<span id='184'>to you: so you may continue and laugh at</span><br/>
<span id='185'>nothing still.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech103'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>What a blow was there given!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech104'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>An it had not fallen flat-long.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech105'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift</span><br/>
<span id='189'>the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue</span><br/>
<span id='190'>in it five weeks without changing.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech106'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech107'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Nay, good my lord, be not angry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech108'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>No, I warrant you; I will not adventure</span><br/>
<span id='194'>my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh</span><br/>
<span id='195'>me asleep, for I am very heavy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech109'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>Go sleep, and hear us.</span><br/>
<p><em>All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech110'><strong>ALONSO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find</span><br/>
<span id='199'>They are inclined to do so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech111'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>Please you, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Do not omit the heavy offer of it:</span><br/>
<span id='202'>It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>It is a comforter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech112'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>                  We two, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Will guard your person while you take your rest,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>And watch your safety.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech113'><strong>ALONSO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='207'>Thank you. Wondrous heavy.</span><br/>
<p><em>ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech114'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>What a strange drowsiness possesses them!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech115'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='209'>It is the quality o' the climate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech116'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>Why</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Myself disposed to sleep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech117'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='213'>Nor I; my spirits are nimble.</span><br/>
<span id='214'>They fell together all, as by consent;</span><br/>
<span id='215'>They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?&mdash;No more:&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='217'>And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,</span><br/>
<span id='218'>What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and</span><br/>
<span id='219'>My strong imagination sees a crown</span><br/>
<span id='220'>Dropping upon thy head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech118'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>What, art thou waking?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech119'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='222'>Do you not hear me speak?</span><br/>

<span id='223'>I do; and surely</span><br/>
<span id='224'>It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?</span><br/>
<span id='226'>This is a strange repose, to be asleep</span><br/>
<span id='227'>With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,</span><br/>
<span id='228'>And yet so fast asleep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech121'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='229'>Noble Sebastian,</span><br/>
<span id='230'>Thou let'st thy fortune sleep&mdash;die, rather; wink'st</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Whiles thou art waking.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech122'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='232'>Thou dost snore distinctly;</span><br/>
<span id='233'>There's meaning in thy snores.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech123'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='234'>I am more serious than my custom: you</span><br/>
<span id='235'>Must be so too, if heed me; which to do</span><br/>
<span id='236'>Trebles thee o'er.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech124'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='237'>                  Well, I am standing water.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech125'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='238'>I'll teach you how to flow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech126'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='239'>Do so: to ebb</span><br/>
<span id='240'>Hereditary sloth instructs me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech127'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='241'>O,</span><br/>
<span id='242'>If you but knew how you the purpose cherish</span><br/>
<span id='243'>Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,</span><br/>
<span id='244'>You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,</span><br/>
<span id='245'>Most often do so near the bottom run</span><br/>
<span id='246'>By their own fear or sloth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech128'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='247'>Prithee, say on:</span><br/>
<span id='248'>The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim</span><br/>
<span id='249'>A matter from thee, and a birth indeed</span><br/>
<span id='250'>Which throes thee much to yield.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech129'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='251'>Thus, sir:</span><br/>
<span id='252'>Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,</span><br/>
<span id='253'>Who shall be of as little memory</span><br/>
<span id='254'>When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='255'>For he's a spirit of persuasion, only</span><br/>
<span id='256'>Professes to persuade,&mdash;the king his son's alive,</span><br/>
<span id='257'>'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd</span><br/>
<span id='258'>And he that sleeps here swims.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech130'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='259'>I have no hope</span><br/>
<span id='260'>That he's undrown'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech131'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='261'>O, out of that 'no hope'</span><br/>
<span id='262'>What great hope have you! no hope that way is</span><br/>
<span id='263'>Another way so high a hope that even</span><br/>
<span id='264'>Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,</span><br/>
<span id='265'>But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me</span><br/>
<span id='266'>That Ferdinand is drown'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech132'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='267'>He's gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech133'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='268'>Then, tell me,</span><br/>
<span id='269'>Who's the next heir of Naples?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech134'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='270'>Claribel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech135'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='271'>She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells</span><br/>
<span id='272'>Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples</span><br/>
<span id='273'>Can have no note, unless the sun were post&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='274'>The man i' the moon's too slow&mdash;till new-born chins</span><br/>
<span id='275'>Be rough and razorable; she that&mdash;from whom?</span><br/>
<span id='276'>We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,</span><br/>
<span id='277'>And by that destiny to perform an act</span><br/>
<span id='278'>Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come</span><br/>
<span id='279'>In yours and my discharge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech136'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='280'>What stuff is this! how say you?</span><br/>
<span id='281'>'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;</span><br/>
<span id='282'>So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions</span><br/>
<span id='283'>There is some space.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech137'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='284'>A space whose every cubit</span><br/>
<span id='285'>Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel</span><br/>
<span id='286'>Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,</span><br/>
<span id='287'>And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death</span><br/>
<span id='288'>That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse</span><br/>
<span id='289'>Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples</span><br/>
<span id='290'>As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate</span><br/>
<span id='291'>As amply and unnecessarily</span><br/>
<span id='292'>As this Gonzalo; I myself could make</span><br/>
<span id='293'>A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore</span><br/>
<span id='294'>The mind that I do! what a sleep were this</span><br/>
<span id='295'>For your advancement! Do you understand me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech138'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='296'>Methinks I do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech139'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>

<span id='297'>                  And how does your content</span><br/>
<span id='298'>Tender your own good fortune?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech140'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='299'>I remember</span><br/>
<span id='300'>You did supplant your brother Prospero.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech141'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='301'>True:</span><br/>
<span id='302'>And look how well my garments sit upon me;</span><br/>
<span id='303'>Much feater than before: my brother's servants</span><br/>
<span id='304'>Were then my fellows; now they are my men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech142'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='305'>But, for your conscience?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech143'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='306'>Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,</span><br/>
<span id='307'>'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not</span><br/>
<span id='308'>This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,</span><br/>
<span id='309'>That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they</span><br/>
<span id='310'>And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,</span><br/>
<span id='311'>No better than the earth he lies upon,</span><br/>
<span id='312'>If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;</span><br/>
<span id='313'>Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,</span><br/>
<span id='314'>Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,</span><br/>
<span id='315'>To the perpetual wink for aye might put</span><br/>
<span id='316'>This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who</span><br/>
<span id='317'>Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,</span><br/>
<span id='318'>They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;</span><br/>
<span id='319'>They'll tell the clock to any business that</span><br/>
<span id='320'>We say befits the hour.</span><br/>

<span id='speech144'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>

<span id='321'>Thy case, dear friend,</span><br/>
<span id='322'>Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,</span><br/>
<span id='323'>I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke</span><br/>
<span id='324'>Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;</span><br/>
<span id='325'>And I the king shall love thee.</span><br/>

<span id='speech147'><strong>ARIEL</strong></span>

<p><em>Sings in GONZALO's ear</em></p>
<span id='333'>While you here do snoring lie,</span><br/>
<span id='334'>Open-eyed conspiracy</span><br/>

<span id='speech152'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>

<span id='345'>Whiles we stood here securing your repose,</span><br/>
<span id='346'>Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing</span><br/>
<span id='347'>Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?</span><br/>
<span id='348'>It struck mine ear most terribly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech153'><strong>ALONSO</strong></span>

<span id='349'>I heard nothing.</span><br/>

<span id='speech154'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>

<span id='350'>O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,</span><br/>
<span id='351'>To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar</span><br/>
<span id='352'>Of a whole herd of lions.</span><br/>

<span id='speech155'><strong>ALONSO</strong></span>

<span id='353'>Heard you this, Gonzalo?</span><br/>

<span id='speech156'><strong>GONZALO</strong></span>

<span id='354'>Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,</span><br/>
<span id='355'>And that a strange one too, which did awake me:</span><br/>
<span id='356'>I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,</span><br/>
<span id='357'>I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,</span><br/>

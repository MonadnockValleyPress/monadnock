<h1>Macbeth</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene VIII</h3>
<h4>Another part of the field.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter MACBETH</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Why should I play the Roman fool, and die</span><br/>
<span id='2'>On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Do better upon them.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MACDUFF</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Turn, hell-hound, turn!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Of all men else I have avoided thee:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>But get thee back; my soul is too much charged</span><br/>
<span id='7'>With blood of thine already.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>I have no words:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Than terms can give thee out!</span><br/>
<p><em>They fight</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Thou losest labour:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air</span><br/>
<span id='13'>With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>To one of woman born.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Despair thy charm;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And let the angel whom thou still hast served</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Untimely ripp'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>For it hath cow'd my better part of man!</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And be these juggling fiends no more believed,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>That palter with us in a double sense;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>That keep the word of promise to our ear,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Then yield thee, coward,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Painted on a pole, and underwrit,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>'Here may you see the tyrant.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I will not yield,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And to be baited with the rabble's curse.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And thou opposed, being of no woman born,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Yet I will try the last. Before my body</span><br/>
<span id='38'>I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt, fighting. Alarums</em></p>
<p><em>Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, MALCOLM, SIWARD, ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SIWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>So great a day as this is cheaply bought.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Macduff is missing, and your noble son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>He only lived but till he was a man;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd</span><br/>
<span id='47'>In the unshrinking station where he fought,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>But like a man he died.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SIWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Then he is dead?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Must not be measured by his worth, for then</span><br/>
<span id='52'>It hath no end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>SIWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>                  Had he his hurts before?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Ay, on the front.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SIWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>                  Why then, God's soldier be he!</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Had I as many sons as I have hairs,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>I would not wish them to a fairer death:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And so, his knell is knoll'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>He's worth more sorrow,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And that I'll spend for him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SIWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>He's worth no more</span><br/>
<span id='62'>They say he parted well, and paid his score:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands</span><br/>
<span id='65'>The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>That speak my salutation in their minds;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Hail, King of Scotland!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Hail, King of Scotland!</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>We shall not spend a large expense of time</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Before we reckon with your several loves,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland</span><br/>
<span id='75'>In such an honour named. What's more to do,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Which would be planted newly with the time,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>As calling home our exiled friends abroad</span><br/>
<span id='78'>That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Producing forth the cruel ministers</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Took off her life; this, and what needful else</span><br/>
<span id='83'>That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>We will perform in measure, time and place:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>So, thanks to all at once and to each one,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish. Exeunt</em></p>

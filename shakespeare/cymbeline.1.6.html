<h4>The same. Another room in the palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter IMOGEN</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>A father cruel, and a step-dame false;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>That hath her husband banish'd;&mdash;O, that husband!</span><br/>
<span id='4'>My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Comes from my lord with letters.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Change you, madam?</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The worthy Leonatus is in safety</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And greets your highness dearly.</span><br/>
<p><em>Presents a letter</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Thanks, good sir:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>You're kindly welcome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>[Aside]  All of her that is out of door most rich!</span><br/>
<span id='18'>If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>She is alone the Arabian bird, and I</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Rather directly fly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>[Reads]  'He is one of the noblest note, to whose</span><br/>
<span id='25'>kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon</span><br/>
<span id='26'>him accordingly, as you value your trust&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>LEONATUS.'</span><br/>
<span id='28'>So far I read aloud:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>But even the very middle of my heart</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Have words to bid you, and shall find it so</span><br/>
<span id='33'>In all that I can do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Thanks, fairest lady.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes</span><br/>
<span id='36'>To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt</span><br/>
<span id='38'>The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Upon the number'd beach? and can we not</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Partition make with spectacles so precious</span><br/>
<span id='41'>'Twixt fair and foul?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>What makes your admiration?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys</span><br/>
<span id='44'>'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>For idiots in this case of favour would</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Should make desire vomit emptiness,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Not so allured to feed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>What is the matter, trow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>The cloyed will,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Longs after for the garbage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>What, dear sir,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Thus raps you? Are you well?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Thanks, madam; well.</span><br/>
<p><em>To PISANIO</em></p>
<span id='59'>Beseech you, sir, desire</span><br/>
<span id='60'>My man's abode where I did leave him: he</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Is strange and peevish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I was going, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>To give him welcome.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Well, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there</span><br/>
<span id='68'>So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd</span><br/>
<span id='69'>The Briton reveller.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>When he was here,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>He did incline to sadness, and oft-times</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Not knowing why.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>                  I never saw him sad.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>There is a Frenchman his companion, one</span><br/>
<span id='75'>An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves</span><br/>
<span id='76'>A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces</span><br/>
<span id='77'>The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Your lord, I mean&mdash;laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows</span><br/>
<span id='80'>By history, report, or his own proof,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose</span><br/>
<span id='82'>But must be, will his free hours languish for</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Assured bondage?'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>                  Will my lord say so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>It is a recreation to be by</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Some men are much to blame.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Not he, I hope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>In you, which I account his beyond all talents,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound</span><br/>
<span id='94'>To pity too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>                  What do you pity, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Two creatures heartily.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Am I one, sir?</span><br/>
<span id='98'>You look on me: what wreck discern you in me</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Deserves your pity?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Lamentable! What,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>To hide me from the radiant sun and solace</span><br/>
<span id='102'>I' the dungeon by a snuff?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>I pray you, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Deliver with more openness your answers</span><br/>
<span id='105'>To my demands. Why do you pity me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>That others do&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>I was about to say&mdash;enjoy your&mdash;But</span><br/>
<span id='108'>It is an office of the gods to venge it,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Not mine to speak on 't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>You do seem to know</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Since doubling things go ill often hurts more</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Than to be sure they do; for certainties</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>The remedy then born&mdash;discover to me</span><br/>
<span id='116'>What both you spur and stop.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Had I this cheek</span><br/>
<span id='118'>To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul</span><br/>
<span id='120'>To the oath of loyalty; this object, which</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Slaver with lips as common as the stairs</span><br/>
<span id='124'>That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Made hard with hourly falsehood&mdash;falsehood, as</span><br/>
<span id='126'>With labour; then by-peeping in an eye</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Base and unlustrous as the smoky light</span><br/>
<span id='128'>That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit</span><br/>
<span id='129'>That all the plagues of hell should at one time</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Encounter such revolt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>My lord, I fear,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Has forgot Britain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>And himself. Not I,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce</span><br/>
<span id='135'>The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces</span><br/>
<span id='136'>That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Charms this report out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Let me hear no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart</span><br/>
<span id='140'>With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady</span><br/>
<span id='141'>So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Would make the great'st king double,&mdash;to be partner'd</span><br/>
<span id='143'>With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures</span><br/>
<span id='145'>That play with all infirmities for gold</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff</span><br/>
<span id='147'>As well might poison poison! Be revenged;</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Or she that bore you was no queen, and you</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Recoil from your great stock.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Revenged!</span><br/>
<span id='151'>How should I be revenged? If this be true,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>As I have such a heart that both mine ears</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Must not in haste abuse&mdash;if it be true,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>How should I be revenged?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>Should he make me</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.</span><br/>
<span id='159'>I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>More noble than that runagate to your bed,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>And will continue fast to your affection,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Still close as sure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>What, ho, Pisanio!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Let me my service tender on your lips.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Away! I do condemn mine ears that have</span><br/>
<span id='166'>So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not</span><br/>
<span id='168'>For such an end thou seek'st,&mdash;as base as strange.</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far</span><br/>
<span id='170'>From thy report as thou from honour, and</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Solicit'st here a lady that disdains</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!</span><br/>
<span id='173'>The king my father shall be made acquainted</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>A saucy stranger in his court to mart</span><br/>
<span id='176'>As in a Romish stew and to expound</span><br/>
<span id='177'>His beastly mind to us, he hath a court</span><br/>
<span id='178'>He little cares for and a daughter who</span><br/>
<span id='179'>He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>O happy Leonatus! I may say</span><br/>
<span id='181'>The credit that thy lady hath of thee</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!</span><br/>
<span id='184'>A lady to the worthiest sir that ever</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only</span><br/>
<span id='186'>For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.</span><br/>
<span id='187'>I have spoke this, to know if your affiance</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>That which he is, new o'er: and he is one</span><br/>
<span id='190'>The truest manner'd; such a holy witch</span><br/>
<span id='191'>That he enchants societies into him;</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Half all men's hearts are his.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>You make amends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:</span><br/>
<span id='195'>He hath a kind of honour sets him off,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Most mighty princess, that I have adventured</span><br/>
<span id='198'>To try your taking a false report; which hath</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment</span><br/>
<span id='200'>In the election of a sir so rare,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>All's well, sir: take my power i' the court</span><br/>
<span id='205'>for yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>My humble thanks. I had almost forgot</span><br/>
<span id='207'>To entreat your grace but in a small request,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>And yet of moment to, for it concerns</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Your lord; myself and other noble friends,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Are partners in the business.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='211'>Pray, what is't?</span><br/>

<span id='speech48'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='212'>Some dozen Romans of us and your lord&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='213'>The best feather of our wing&mdash;have mingled sums</span><br/>
<span id='214'>To buy a present for the emperor</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Which I, the factor for the rest, have done</span><br/>
<span id='216'>In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels</span><br/>
<span id='217'>Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;</span><br/>
<span id='218'>And I am something curious, being strange,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>To have them in safe stowage: may it please you</span><br/>
<span id='220'>To take them in protection?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>Willingly;</span><br/>

<span id='225'>They are in a trunk,</span><br/>

<span id='227'>To send them to you, only for this night;</span><br/>
<span id='228'>I must aboard to-morrow.</span><br/>

<span id='speech51'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='229'>O, no, no.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='230'>Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word</span><br/>
<span id='231'>By lengthening my return. From Gallia</span><br/>

<span id='233'>To see your grace.</span><br/>

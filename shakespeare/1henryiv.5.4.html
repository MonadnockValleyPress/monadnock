<h1>Henry IV, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Another part of the field.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Alarum. Excursions. Enter PRINCE HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, and EARL OF WESTMORELAND</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I prithee,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Harry, withdraw thyself; thou bleed'st too much.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>I beseech your majesty, make up,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>I will do so.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And rebels' arms triumph in massacres!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>We breathe too long: come, cousin Westmoreland,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Our duty this way lies; for God's sake come.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt LANCASTER and WESTMORELAND</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Before, I loved thee as a brother, John;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>But now, I do respect thee as my soul.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point</span><br/>
<span id='22'>With lustier maintenance than I did look for</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Of such an ungrown warrior.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>O, this boy</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Lends mettle to us all!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter DOUGLAS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>EARL OF DOUGLAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>I am the Douglas, fatal to all those</span><br/>
<span id='28'>That wear those colours on them: what art thou,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>That counterfeit'st the person of a king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>The king himself; who, Douglas, grieves at heart</span><br/>
<span id='31'>So many of his shadows thou hast met</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And not the very king. I have two boys</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Seek Percy and thyself about the field:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>I will assay thee: so, defend thyself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>EARL OF DOUGLAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>I fear thou art another counterfeit;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And thus I win thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>They fight. KING HENRY being in danger, PRINCE HENRY enters</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Never to hold it up again! the spirits</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Who never promiseth but he means to pay.</span><br/>
<p><em>They fight: DOUGLAS flies</em></p>
<span id='45'>Cheerly, my lord	how fares your grace?</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Stay, and breathe awhile:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And show'd thou makest some tender of my life,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>O God! they did me too much injury</span><br/>
<span id='53'>That ever said I hearken'd for your death.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>If it were so, I might have let alone</span><br/>
<span id='55'>The insulting hand of Douglas over you,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Which would have been as speedy in your end</span><br/>
<span id='57'>As all the poisonous potions in the world</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And saved the treacherous labour of your son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter HOTSPUR</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>My name is Harry Percy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Why, then I see</span><br/>
<span id='64'>A very valiant rebel of the name.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>To share with me in glory any more:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Nor can one England brook a double reign,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come</span><br/>
<span id='71'>To end the one of us; and would to God</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And all the budding honours on thy crest</span><br/>
<span id='75'>I'll crop, to make a garland for my head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>I can no longer brook thy vanities.</span><br/>
<p><em>They fight</em></p>
<p><em>Enter FALSTAFF</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find no</span><br/>
<span id='78'>boy's play here, I can tell you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter DOUGLAS; he fights with FALSTAFF,  who falls down as if he were dead, and exit DOUGLAS. HOTSPUR is wounded, and falls</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I better brook the loss of brittle life</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And time, that takes survey of all the world,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>But that the earthy and cold hand of death</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And food for&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>Dies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!</span><br/>
<span id='91'>When that this body did contain a spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>A kingdom for it was too small a bound;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>But now two paces of the vilest earth</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>If thou wert sensible of courtesy,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>I should not make so dear a show of zeal:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>But let my favours hide thy mangled face;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself</span><br/>
<span id='100'>For doing these fair rites of tenderness.</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>But not remember'd in thy epitaph!</span><br/>
<p><em>He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground</em></p>
<span id='104'>What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!</span><br/>
<span id='106'>I could have better spared a better man:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>If I were much in love with vanity!</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit PRINCE HENRY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>[Rising up]  Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too</span><br/>
<span id='115'>to-morrow. 'Sblood, 'twas time to counterfeit, or</span><br/>
<span id='116'>that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the</span><br/>
<span id='119'>counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby</span><br/>
<span id='121'>liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and</span><br/>
<span id='122'>perfect image of life indeed. The better part of</span><br/>
<span id='123'>valour is discretion; in the which better part I</span><br/>
<span id='124'>have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this</span><br/>
<span id='125'>gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he</span><br/>
<span id='126'>should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am</span><br/>
<span id='127'>afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I</span><br/>
<span id='129'>killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Therefore, sirrah,</span><br/>
<p><em>Stabbing him</em></p>
<span id='132'>with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Takes up HOTSPUR on his back</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Thy maiden sword.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>                  But, soft! whom have we here?</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>I did; I saw him dead,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art</span><br/>
<span id='139'>thou alive?</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?</span><br/>
<span id='141'>I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I</span><br/>
<span id='144'>be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:</span><br/>
<p><em>Throwing the body down</em></p>
<span id='145'>if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let</span><br/>
<span id='146'>him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either</span><br/>
<span id='147'>earl or duke, I can assure you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to</span><br/>
<span id='150'>lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;</span><br/>
<span id='151'>and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and</span><br/>
<span id='152'>fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be</span><br/>
<span id='153'>believed, so; if not, let them that should reward</span><br/>
<span id='154'>valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take</span><br/>
<span id='155'>it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the</span><br/>
<span id='156'>thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>This is the strangest fellow, brother John.</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.</span><br/>
<p><em>A retreat is sounded</em></p>
<span id='163'>The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>To see what friends are living, who are dead.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that</span><br/>
<span id='167'>rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>I'll grow less; for I'll purge, and leave sack, and</span><br/>
<span id='169'>live cleanly as a nobleman should do.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<h1>Cymbeline</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Britain. Before Cymbeline's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CLOTEN and two Lords</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the</span><br/>
<span id='2'>jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a</span><br/>
<span id='3'>hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes</span><br/>
<span id='4'>must take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mine</span><br/>
<span id='5'>oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>What got he by that? You have broke his pate with</span><br/>
<span id='7'>your bowl.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>[Aside]  If his wit had been like him that broke it,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>it would have run all out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for</span><br/>
<span id='11'>any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>No my lord;</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='13'>nor crop the ears of them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Would he had been one of my rank!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>[Aside]  To have smelt like a fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a</span><br/>
<span id='18'>pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>they dare not fight with me, because of the queen my</span><br/>
<span id='20'>mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of</span><br/>
<span id='21'>fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that</span><br/>
<span id='22'>nobody can match.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>[Aside]  You are cock and capon too; and you crow,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>cock, with your comb on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Sayest thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>It is not fit your lordship should undertake every</span><br/>
<span id='27'>companion that you give offence to.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit</span><br/>
<span id='29'>offence to my inferiors.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Why, so I say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>A stranger, and I not know on't!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>[Aside]  He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it</span><br/>
<span id='35'>not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Leonatus' friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>One of your lordship's pages.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no</span><br/>
<span id='42'>derogation in't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>You cannot derogate, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Not easily, I think.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>[Aside]  You are a fool granted; therefore your</span><br/>
<span id='46'>issues, being foolish, do not derogate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost</span><br/>
<span id='48'>to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>I'll attend your lordship.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord</em></p>
<span id='50'>That such a crafty devil as is his mother</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Should yield the world this ass! a woman that</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Bears all down with her brain; and this her son</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer</span><br/>
<span id='58'>More hateful than the foul expulsion is</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Of the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firm</span><br/>
<span id='61'>The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshaked</span><br/>
<span id='62'>That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

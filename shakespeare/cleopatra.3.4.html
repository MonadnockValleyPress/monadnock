<h4>Athens. A room in Mark Antony's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter MARK ANTONY and OCTAVIA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>That were excusable, that, and thousands more</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Of semblable import,&mdash;but he hath waged</span><br/>
<span id='4'>New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it</span><br/>
<span id='5'>To public ear:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not</span><br/>
<span id='7'>But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly</span><br/>
<span id='8'>He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>When the best hint was given him, he not took't,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Or did it from his teeth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>OCTAVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>O my good lord,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Believe not all; or, if you must believe,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>If this division chance, ne'er stood between,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Praying for both parts:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The good gods me presently,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway</span><br/>
<span id='21'>'Twixt these extremes at all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Gentle Octavia,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>I lose myself: better I were not yours</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I'll raise the preparation of a war</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>So your desires are yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>OCTAVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Thanks to my lord.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be</span><br/>
<span id='34'>As if the world should cleave, and that slain men</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Should solder up the rift.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>When it appears to you where this begins,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Can never be so equal, that your love</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Can equally move with them. Provide your going;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Choose your own company, and command what cost</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Your heart has mind to.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

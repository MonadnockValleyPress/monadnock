<h1>Cymbeline</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene V</h3>
<h4>Cymbeline's tent.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO, Lords, Officers, and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart</span><br/>
<span id='3'>That the poor soldier that so richly fought,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Stepp'd before larges of proof, cannot be found:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>He shall be happy that can find him, if</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Our grace can make him so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>I never saw</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Such noble fury in so poor a thing;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Such precious deeds in one that promises nought</span><br/>
<span id='11'>But beggary and poor looks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>No tidings of him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>He hath been search'd among the dead and living,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>But no trace of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>To my grief, I am</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The heir of his reward;</span><br/>
<p><em>To BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS</em></p>
<span id='17'>which I will add</span><br/>
<span id='18'>To you, the liver, heart and brain of Britain,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To ask of whence you are. Report it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Sir,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Further to boast were neither true nor modest,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Unless I add, we are honest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Bow your knees.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Arise my knights o' the battle: I create you</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Companions to our person and will fit you</span><br/>
<span id='28'>With dignities becoming your estates.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CORNELIUS and Ladies</em></p>
<span id='29'>There's business in these faces. Why so sadly</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Greet you our victory? you look like Romans,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And not o' the court of Britain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CORNELIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Hail, great king!</span><br/>
<span id='33'>To sour your happiness, I must report</span><br/>
<span id='34'>The queen is dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Who worse than a physician</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Would this report become? But I consider,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CORNELIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>With horror, madly dying, like her life,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Which, being cruel to the world, concluded</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd</span><br/>
<span id='42'>I will report, so please you: these her women</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Were present when she finish'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Prithee, say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CORNELIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>First, she confess'd she never loved you, only</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Affected greatness got by you, not you:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Married your royalty, was wife to your place;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Abhorr'd your person.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>She alone knew this;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And, but she spoke it dying, I would not</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CORNELIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love</span><br/>
<span id='54'>With such integrity, she did confess</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>But that her flight prevented it, she had</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Ta'en off by poison.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>O most delicate fiend!</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CORNELIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had</span><br/>
<span id='61'>For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Should by the minute feed on life and lingering</span><br/>
<span id='63'>By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to</span><br/>
<span id='65'>O'ercome you with her show, and in time,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>When she had fitted you with her craft, to work</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Her son into the adoption of the crown:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>But, failing of her end by his strange absence,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despite</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented</span><br/>
<span id='71'>The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Despairing died.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>                  Heard you all this, her women?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>First Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>We did, so please your highness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Mine eyes</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>That thought her like her seeming; it had</span><br/>
<span id='79'>been vicious</span><br/>
<span id='80'>To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!</span><br/>
<span id='81'>That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the Soothsayer, and other  Roman Prisoners, guarded; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS behind, and IMOGEN</em></p>
<span id='83'>Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute that</span><br/>
<span id='84'>The Britons have razed out, though with the loss</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit</span><br/>
<span id='86'>That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Of you their captives, which ourself have granted:</span><br/>
<span id='88'>So think of your estate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CAIUS LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>We should not, when the blood was cool,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>have threaten'd</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives</span><br/>
<span id='95'>May be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficeth</span><br/>
<span id='96'>A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Augustus lives to think on't: and so much</span><br/>
<span id='98'>For my peculiar care. This one thing only</span><br/>
<span id='99'>I will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Let him be ransom'd: never master had</span><br/>
<span id='101'>A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>So tender over his occasions, true,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join</span><br/>
<span id='104'>With my request, which I make bold your highness</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And spare no blood beside.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>I have surely seen him:</span><br/>
<span id='109'>His favour is familiar to me. Boy,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:</span><br/>
<span id='113'>And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>The noblest ta'en.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>                  I humbly thank your highness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CAIUS LUCIUS</strong></span>

<span id='118'>I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And yet I know thou wilt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>No, no: alack,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>There's other work in hand: I see a thing</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Must shuffle for itself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CAIUS LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>The boy disdains me,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys</span><br/>
<span id='126'>That place them on the truth of girls and boys.</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Why stands he so perplex'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>What wouldst thou, boy?</span><br/>
<span id='129'>I love thee more and more: think more and more</span><br/>
<span id='130'>What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>He is a Roman; no more kin to me</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Than I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Am something nearer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Wherefore eyest him so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please</span><br/>
<span id='137'>To give me hearing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Ay, with all my heart,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>And lend my best attention. What's thy name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Fidele, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>

<span id='141'>                  Thou'rt my good youth, my page;</span><br/>
<span id='142'>I'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.</span><br/>
<p><em>CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart</em></p>

<span id='143'>Is not this boy revived from death?</span><br/>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>

<span id='144'>One sand another</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?</span><br/>

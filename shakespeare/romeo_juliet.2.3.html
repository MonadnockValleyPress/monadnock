<em>Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels</span><br/>
<span id='4'>From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>I must up-fill this osier cage of ours</span><br/>
<span id='8'>With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>What is her burying grave that is her womb,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And from her womb children of divers kind</span><br/>
<span id='12'>We sucking on her natural bosom find,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Many for many virtues excellent,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>None but for some and yet all different.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies</span><br/>
<span id='16'>In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>For nought so vile that on the earth doth live</span><br/>
<span id='18'>But to the earth some special good doth give,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And vice sometimes by action dignified.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Within the infant rind of this small flower</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Poison hath residence and medicine power:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Two such opposed kings encamp them still</span><br/>
<span id='28'>In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And where the worser is predominant,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ROMEO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Good morrow, father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Benedicite!</span><br/>
<span id='33'>What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Young son, it argues a distemper'd head</span><br/>
<span id='35'>So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Therefore thy earliness doth me assure</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Or if not so, then here I hit it right,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>I have been feasting with mine enemy,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>That's by me wounded: both our remedies</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Within thy help and holy physic lies:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>My intercession likewise steads my foe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set</span><br/>
<span id='59'>On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And all combined, save what thou must combine</span><br/>
<span id='62'>By holy marriage: when and where and how</span><br/>
<span id='63'>We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>That thou consent to marry us to-day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!</span><br/>
<span id='72'>How much salt water thrown away in waste,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>To season love, that of it doth not taste!</span><br/>
<span id='74'>The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>And bad'st me bury love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Not in a grave,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>To lay one in, another out to have.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>The other did not so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>O, she knew well</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>But come, young waverer, come, go with me,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>In one respect I'll thy assistant be;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>For this alliance may so happy prove,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>To turn your households' rancour to pure love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

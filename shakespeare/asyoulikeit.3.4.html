<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>The forest.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ROSALIND and CELIA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Never talk to me; I will weep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider</span><br/>
<span id='3'>that tears do not become a man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>But have I not cause to weep?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>His very hair is of the dissembling colour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Judas's own children.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch</span><br/>
<span id='12'>of holy bread.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun</span><br/>
<span id='14'>of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>the very ice of chastity is in them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>But why did he swear he would come this morning, and</span><br/>
<span id='17'>comes not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Do you think so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a</span><br/>
<span id='21'>horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do</span><br/>
<span id='22'>think him as concave as a covered goblet or a</span><br/>
<span id='23'>worm-eaten nut.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Not true in love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>You have heard him swear downright he was.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is</span><br/>
<span id='28'>no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are</span><br/>
<span id='29'>both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends</span><br/>
<span id='30'>here in the forest on the duke your father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>I met the duke yesterday and had much question with</span><br/>
<span id='32'>him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told</span><br/>
<span id='33'>him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a</span><br/>
<span id='35'>man as Orlando?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks</span><br/>
<span id='38'>them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of</span><br/>
<span id='39'>his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse</span><br/>
<span id='40'>but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble</span><br/>
<span id='41'>goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly</span><br/>
<span id='42'>guides. Who comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CORIN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CORIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Mistress and master, you have oft inquired</span><br/>
<span id='44'>After the shepherd that complain'd of love,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess</span><br/>
<span id='47'>That was his mistress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Well, and what of him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CORIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>If you will see a pageant truly play'd,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Between the pale complexion of true love</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>If you will mark it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>O, come, let us remove:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Bring us to this sight, and you shall say</span><br/>
<span id='57'>I'll prove a busy actor in their play.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

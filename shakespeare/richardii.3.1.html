<span id='speech1'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Bring forth these men.</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Since presently your souls must part your bodies&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>With too much urging your pernicious lives,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood</span><br/>
<span id='6'>From off my hands, here in the view of men</span><br/>
<span id='7'>I will unfold some causes of your deaths.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>You have misled a prince, a royal king,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>By you unhappied and disfigured clean:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>You have in manner with your sinful hours</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Broke the possession of a royal bed</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks</span><br/>
<span id='15'>With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Near to the king in blood, and near in love</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Till you did make him misinterpret me,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Eating the bitter bread of banishment;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Whilst you have fed upon my signories,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>From my own windows torn my household coat,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Save men's opinions and my living blood,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>To show the world I am a gentleman.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>This and much more, much more than twice all this,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over</span><br/>
<span id='30'>To execution and the hand of death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BUSHY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>More welcome is the stroke of death to me</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>GREEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>My comfort is that heaven will take our souls</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And plague injustice with the pains of hell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND and others, with the prisoners</em></p>
<span id='36'>Uncle, you say the queen is at your house;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Tell her I send to her my kind commends;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Take special care my greetings be deliver'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd</span><br/>
<span id='41'>With letters of your love to her at large.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>To fight with Glendower and his complices:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Awhile to work, and after holiday.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

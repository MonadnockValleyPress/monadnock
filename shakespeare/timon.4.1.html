<h1>Timon of Athens</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Without the walls of Athens.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter TIMON</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And minister in their steads! to general filths</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Convert o' the instant, green virginity,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Rather than render back, out with your knives,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Decline to your confounding contraries,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And let confusion live! Plagues, incident to men,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Your potent and infectious fevers heap</span><br/>
<span id='23'>On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt</span><br/>
<span id='25'>As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their crop</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>at their society, as their friendship, may</span><br/>
<span id='32'>merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>But nakedness, thou detestable town!</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Timon will to the woods; where he shall find</span><br/>
<span id='36'>The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>The gods confound&mdash;hear me, you good gods all&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>The Athenians both within and out that wall!</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow</span><br/>
<span id='40'>To the whole race of mankind, high and low! Amen.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<h3>CIV</h3>
<p>
To me, fair friend, you never can be old,<br/>
For as you were when first your eye I ey'd,<br/>
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,<br/>
Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,<br/>
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd,<br/>
In process of the seasons have I seen,<br/>
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,<br/>
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.<br/>
Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,<br/>
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv'd;<br/>
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,<br/>
Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv'd:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.<br/>

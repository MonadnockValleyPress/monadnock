<h1>Titus Andronicus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Plains near Rome.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LUCIUS with an army of Goths, with drum and colours</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>I have received letters from great Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Which signify what hate they bear their emperor</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And how desirous of our sight they are.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Let him make treble satisfaction.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Goth</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Whose high exploits and honourable deeds</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Led by their master to the flowered fields,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And be avenged on cursed Tamora.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>All the Goths</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>And as he saith, so say we all with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Goth, leading AARON with his Child in his arms</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Second Goth</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Upon the wasted building, suddenly</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I heard a child cry underneath a wall.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>I made unto the noise; when soon I heard</span><br/>
<span id='26'>The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>They never do beget a coal-black calf.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Peace, villain, peace!'&mdash;even thus he rates</span><br/>
<span id='34'>the babe,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'</span><br/>
<span id='38'>With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>To use as you think needful of the man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil</span><br/>
<span id='42'>That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey</span><br/>
<span id='46'>This growing image of thy fiend-like face?</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?</span><br/>
<span id='48'>A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And by his side his fruit of bastardy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Too like the sire for ever being good.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>A sight to vex the father's soul withal.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Get me a ladder.</span><br/>
<p><em>A ladder brought, which AARON is made to ascend</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>                  Lucius, save the child,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And bear it from me to the empress.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>That highly may advantage thee to hear:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Acts of black night, abominable deeds,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Complots of mischief, treason, villanies</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And this shall all be buried by my death,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Yet, for I know thou art religious</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And hast a thing within thee called conscience,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Which I have seen thee careful to observe,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know</span><br/>
<span id='81'>An idiot holds his bauble for a god</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow</span><br/>
<span id='84'>By that same god, what god soe'er it be,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>That thou adorest and hast in reverence,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Or else I will discover nought to thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Even by my god I swear to thee I will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>First know thou, I begot him on the empress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>O most insatiate and luxurious woman!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity</span><br/>
<span id='92'>To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>That codding spirit had they from their mother,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>As sure a card as ever won the set;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>As true a dog as ever fought at head.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.</span><br/>
<span id='106'>I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>I wrote the letter that thy father found</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Confederate with the queen and her two sons:</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?</span><br/>
<span id='113'>I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And, when I had it, drew myself apart</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:</span><br/>
<span id='116'>I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall</span><br/>
<span id='117'>When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :</span><br/>
<span id='120'>And when I told the empress of this sport,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>First Goth</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Even now I curse the day&mdash;and yet, I think,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Few come within the compass of my curse,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Wherein I did not some notorious ill,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>As kill a man, or else devise his death,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Set deadly enmity between two friends,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Make poor men's cattle break their necks;</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And bid the owners quench them with their tears.</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;</span><br/>
<span id='140'>And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things</span><br/>
<span id='144'>As willingly as one would kill a fly,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And nothing grieves me heartily indeed</span><br/>
<span id='146'>But that I cannot do ten thousand more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Bring down the devil; for he must not die</span><br/>
<span id='148'>So sweet a death as hanging presently.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>If there be devils, would I were a devil,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>To live and burn in everlasting fire,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>So I might have your company in hell,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>But to torment you with my bitter tongue!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Goth</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Third Goth</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>My lord, there is a messenger from Rome</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Desires to be admitted to your presence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Let him come near.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter AEMILIUS</em></p>
<span id='157'>Welcome, AEmilius	what's the news from Rome?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>AEMILIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>The Roman emperor greets you all by me;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>And, for he understands you are in arms,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>He craves a parley at your father's house,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Willing you to demand your hostages,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>And they shall be immediately deliver'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>First Goth</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>What says our general?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>AEmilius, let the emperor give his pledges</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>And we will come. March away.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Henry IV, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene V</H3>
<h4>A public place near Westminster Abbey.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter two Grooms, strewing rushes</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Groom</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>More rushes, more rushes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Groom</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>The trumpets have sounded twice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>First Groom</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>'Twill be two o'clock ere they come from the</span><br/>
<span id='4'>coronation: dispatch, dispatch.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
<p><em>Enter FALSTAFF, SHALLOW, PISTOL, BARDOLPH, and Page</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow; I will</span><br/>
<span id='6'>make the king do you grace: I will leer upon him as</span><br/>
<span id='7'>a' comes by; and do but mark the countenance that he</span><br/>
<span id='8'>will give me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PISTOL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>God bless thy lungs, good knight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Come here, Pistol; stand behind me. O, if I had had</span><br/>
<span id='11'>time to have made new liveries, I would have</span><br/>
<span id='12'>bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you. But</span><br/>
<span id='13'>'tis no matter; this poor show doth better: this</span><br/>
<span id='14'>doth infer the zeal I had to see him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>It doth so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>It shows my earnestness of affection,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>It doth so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>My devotion,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>It doth, it doth, it doth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>As it were, to ride day and night; and not to</span><br/>
<span id='21'>deliberate, not to remember, not to have patience</span><br/>
<span id='22'>to shift me,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>It is best, certain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>But to stand stained with travel, and sweating with</span><br/>
<span id='25'>desire to see him; thinking of nothing else,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>putting all affairs else in oblivion, as if there</span><br/>
<span id='27'>were nothing else to be done but to see him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PISTOL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>'Tis 'semper idem,' for 'obsque hoc nihil est:'</span><br/>
<span id='29'>'tis all in every part.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>'Tis so, indeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PISTOL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And make thee rage.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Thy Doll, and Helen of thy noble thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Is in base durance and contagious prison;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Haled thither</span><br/>
<span id='36'>By most mechanical and dirty hand:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Alecto's snake,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>For Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>I will deliver her.</span><br/>
<p><em>Shouts within, and the trumpets sound</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PISTOL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>There roar'd the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter KING HENRY V and his train, the Lord Chief-Justice among them</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>God save thy grace, King Hal! my royal Hal!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PISTOL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>The heavens thee guard and keep, most royal imp of fame!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>God save thee, my sweet boy!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>My lord chief-justice, speak to that vain man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>
<span id='speech24'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Have you your wits? know you what 'tis to speak?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>My king! my Jove! I speak to thee, my heart!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!</span><br/>
<span id='50'>I have long dream'd of such a kind of man,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>So surfeit-swell'd, so old and so profane;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>But, being awaked, I do despise my dream.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape</span><br/>
<span id='55'>For thee thrice wider than for other men.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Reply not to me with a fool-born jest:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Presume not that I am the thing I was;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>That I have turn'd away my former self;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>So will I those that kept me company.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>When thou dost hear I am as I have been,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>The tutor and the feeder of my riots:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Till then, I banish thee, on pain of death,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>As I have done the rest of my misleaders,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Not to come near our person by ten mile.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>For competence of life I will allow you,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>That lack of means enforce you not to evil:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>We will, according to your strengths and qualities,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>To see perform'd the tenor of our word. Set on.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt KING HENRY V,  & c</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Yea, marry, Sir John; which I beseech you to let me</span><br/>
<span id='75'>have home with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not you</span><br/>
<span id='77'>grieve at this; I shall be sent for in private to</span><br/>
<span id='78'>him: look you, he must seem thus to the world:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>fear not your advancements; I will be the man yet</span><br/>
<span id='80'>that shall make you great.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>I cannot well perceive how, unless you should give</span><br/>
<span id='82'>me your doublet and stuff me out with straw. I</span><br/>
<span id='83'>beseech you, good Sir John, let me have five hundred</span><br/>
<span id='84'>of my thousand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Sir, I will be as good as my word: this that you</span><br/>
<span id='86'>heard was but a colour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>SHALLOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>A colour that I fear you will die in, Sir John.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Fear no colours: go  with me to dinner: come,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Lieutenant Pistol; come, Bardolph: I shall be sent</span><br/>
<span id='90'>for soon at night.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Prince John of LANCASTER, the Lord Chief-Justice; Officers with them</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Take all his company along with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>My lord, my lord,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>cannot now speak: I will hear you soon.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Take them away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>PISTOL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Si fortune me tormenta, spero contenta.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but PRINCE JOHN and the Lord Chief-Justice</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>I like this fair proceeding of the king's:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>He hath intent his wonted followers</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Shall all be very well provided for;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>But all are banish'd till their conversations</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Appear more wise and modest to the world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>And so they are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>The king hath call'd his parliament, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>He hath.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>We bear our civil swords and native fire</span><br/>
<span id='107'>As far as France: I beard a bird so sing,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Whose music, to my thinking, pleased the king.</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Come, will you hence?</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
<span id='110'>EPILOGUE</span><br/>
<p><em>Spoken by a Dancer</em></p>
<span id='111'>First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;</span><br/>
<span id='113'>and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look</span><br/>
<span id='114'>for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have</span><br/>
<span id='115'>to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I</span><br/>
<span id='116'>should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.</span><br/>
<span id='117'>But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it</span><br/>
<span id='118'>known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here</span><br/>
<span id='119'>in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your</span><br/>
<span id='120'>patience for it and to promise you a better. I</span><br/>
<span id='121'>meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an</span><br/>
<span id='122'>ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and</span><br/>
<span id='123'>you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you</span><br/>
<span id='124'>I would be and here I commit my body to your</span><br/>
<span id='125'>mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.</span><br/>
<span id='127'>If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will</span><br/>
<span id='128'>you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but</span><br/>
<span id='129'>light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a</span><br/>
<span id='130'>good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have</span><br/>
<span id='132'>forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the</span><br/>
<span id='133'>gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which</span><br/>
<span id='134'>was never seen before in such an assembly.</span><br/>
<span id='135'>One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too</span><br/>
<span id='136'>much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will</span><br/>
<span id='137'>continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make</span><br/>
<span id='138'>you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for</span><br/>
<span id='139'>any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>unless already a' be killed with your hard</span><br/>
<span id='141'>opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is</span><br/>
<span id='142'>not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are</span><br/>
<span id='143'>too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down</span><br/>
<span id='144'>before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.</span><br/>

<h4>Scene I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Who's there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>FRANCISCO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Long live the king!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>FRANCISCO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Bernardo?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>He.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>FRANCISCO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>You come most carefully upon your hour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>FRANCISCO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And I am sick at heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Have you had quiet guard?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>FRANCISCO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Not a mouse stirring.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Well, good night.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>FRANCISCO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Friends to this ground.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>And liegemen to the Dane.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>FRANCISCO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Give you good night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>O, farewell, honest soldier:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Who hath relieved you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>FRANCISCO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Bernardo has my place.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Give you good night.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Holla! Bernardo!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Say,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>What, is Horatio there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>A piece of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>I have seen nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And will not let belief take hold of him</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Therefore I have entreated him along</span><br/>
<span id='34'>With us to watch the minutes of this night;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>That if again this apparition come,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Sit down awhile;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And let us once again assail your ears,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>That are so fortified against our story</span><br/>
<span id='41'>What we have two nights seen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Well, sit we down,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Last night of all,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>When yond same star that's westward from the pole</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Had made his course to illume that part of heaven</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The bell then beating one,&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Ghost</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>In the same figure, like the king that's dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>It would be spoke to.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Question it, Horatio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Together with that fair and warlike form</span><br/>
<span id='58'>In which the majesty of buried Denmark</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>It is offended.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>                  See, it stalks away!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Ghost</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>'Tis gone, and will not answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Is not this something more than fantasy?</span><br/>
<span id='66'>What think you on't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Before my God, I might not this believe</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Without the sensible and true avouch</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Of mine own eyes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>                  Is it not like the king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>As thou art to thyself:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Such was the very armour he had on</span><br/>
<span id='73'>When he the ambitious Norway combated;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>'Tis strange.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>In what particular thought to work I know not;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>But in the gross and scope of my opinion,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Why this same strict and most observant watch</span><br/>
<span id='84'>So nightly toils the subject of the land,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And foreign mart for implements of war;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Does not divide the Sunday from the week;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Who is't that can inform me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>That can I;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Whose image even but now appear'd to us,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>For so this side of our known world esteem'd him&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Well ratified by law and heraldry,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Against the which, a moiety competent</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Was gaged by our king; which had return'd</span><br/>
<span id='105'>To the inheritance of Fortinbras,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And carriage of the article design'd,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>For food and diet, to some enterprise</span><br/>
<span id='113'>That hath a stomach in't; which is no other&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>As it doth well appear unto our state&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>But to recover of us, by strong hand</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</span><br/>
<span id='117'>So by his father lost: and this, I take it,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Is the main motive of our preparations,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>The source of this our watch and the chief head</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>I think it be no other but e'en so:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Well may it sort that this portentous figure</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Comes armed through our watch; so like the king</span><br/>
<span id='124'>That was and is the question of these wars.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.</span><br/>
<span id='126'>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And even the like precurse of fierce events,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>As harbingers preceding still the fates</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And prologue to the omen coming on,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Unto our climatures and countrymen.&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Ghost</em></p>
<span id='140'>I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!</span><br/>
<span id='141'>If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Speak to me:</span><br/>
<span id='143'>If there be any good thing to be done,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>That may to thee do ease and grace to me,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Speak to me:</span><br/>
<p><em>Cock crows</em></p>
<span id='146'>If thou art privy to thy country's fate,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Shall I strike at it with my partisan?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Do, if it will not stand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>'Tis here!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>'Tis here!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>'Tis gone!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Ghost</em></p>
<span id='157'>We do it wrong, being so majestical,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>To offer it the show of violence;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>For it is, as the air, invulnerable,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>And our vain blows malicious mockery.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>BERNARDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>And then it started like a guilty thing</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>The extravagant and erring spirit hies</span><br/>
<span id='169'>To his confine: and of the truth herein</span><br/>
<span id='170'>This present object made probation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>The bird of dawning singeth all night long:</span><br/>
<span id='175'>And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;</span><br/>
<span id='176'>The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>So have I heard and do in part believe it.</span><br/>
<span id='180'>But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Break we our watch up; and by my advice,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Let us impart what we have seen to-night</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Where we shall find him most conveniently.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

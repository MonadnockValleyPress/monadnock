<h1>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Mytilene. A room in a brothel.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Pandar</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Boult!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Pandar</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of</span><br/>
<span id='4'>gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being</span><br/>
<span id='5'>too wenchless.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>We were never so much out of creatures. We have but</span><br/>
<span id='7'>poor three, and they can do no more than they can</span><br/>
<span id='8'>do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Pandar</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay for</span><br/>
<span id='10'>them. If there be not a conscience to be used in</span><br/>
<span id='11'>every trade, we shall never prosper.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor</span><br/>
<span id='13'>bastards,&mdash;as, I think, I have brought up some eleven&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. But</span><br/>
<span id='15'>shall I search the market?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind</span><br/>
<span id='17'>will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Pandar</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o'</span><br/>
<span id='19'>conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, that</span><br/>
<span id='20'>lay with the little baggage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat</span><br/>
<span id='22'>for worms. But I'll go search the market.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Pandar</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a</span><br/>
<span id='24'>proportion to live quietly, and so give over.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Why to give over, I pray you? is it a shame to get</span><br/>
<span id='26'>when we are old?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Pandar</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor</span><br/>
<span id='28'>the commodity wages not with the danger: therefore,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>if in our youths we could pick up some pretty</span><br/>
<span id='30'>estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door hatched.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods</span><br/>
<span id='32'>will be strong with us for giving over.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Come, other sorts offend as well as we.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Pandar</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>As well as we! ay, and better too; we offend worse.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Neither is our profession any trade; it's no</span><br/>
<span id='36'>calling. But here comes Boult.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter BOULT, with the Pirates and MARINA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>[To MARINA]  Come your ways. My masters, you say</span><br/>
<span id='38'>she's a virgin?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>First Pirate</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>O, sir, we doubt it not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Master, I have gone through for this piece, you see:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>if you like her, so; if not, I have lost my earnest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Boult, has she any qualities?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent</span><br/>
<span id='44'>good clothes: there's no further necessity of</span><br/>
<span id='45'>qualities can make her be refused.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>What's her price, Boult?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Pandar</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Well, follow me, my masters, you shall have your</span><br/>
<span id='49'>money presently. Wife, take her in; instruct her</span><br/>
<span id='50'>what she has to do, that she may not be raw in her</span><br/>
<span id='51'>entertainment.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Pandar and Pirates</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Boult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her</span><br/>
<span id='53'>hair, complexion, height, age, with warrant of her</span><br/>
<span id='54'>virginity; and cry 'He that will give most shall</span><br/>
<span id='55'>have her first.' Such a maidenhead were no cheap</span><br/>
<span id='56'>thing, if men were as they have been. Get this done</span><br/>
<span id='57'>as I command you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Performance shall follow.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!</span><br/>
<span id='60'>He should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Not enough barbarous, had not o'erboard thrown me</span><br/>
<span id='62'>For to seek my mother!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Why lament you, pretty one?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>That I am pretty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Come, the gods have done their part in you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>I accuse them not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>You are light into my hands, where you are like to live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>The more my fault</span><br/>
<span id='69'>To scape his hands where I was like to die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>No.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Yes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all</span><br/>
<span id='73'>fashions: you shall fare well; you shall have the</span><br/>
<span id='74'>difference of all complexions. What! do you stop your ears?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Are you a woman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>What would you have me be, an I be not a woman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>An honest woman, or not a woman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Marry, whip thee, gosling: I think I shall have</span><br/>
<span id='79'>something to do with you. Come, you're a young</span><br/>
<span id='80'>foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would have</span><br/>
<span id='81'>you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>The gods defend me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>If it please the gods to defend you by men, then men</span><br/>
<span id='84'>must comfort you, men must feed you, men must stir</span><br/>
<span id='85'>you up. Boult's returned.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter BOULT</em></p>
<span id='86'>Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>I have drawn her picture with my voice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the</span><br/>
<span id='90'>inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>'Faith, they listened to me as they would have</span><br/>
<span id='92'>hearkened to their father's testament. There was a</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Spaniard's mouth so watered, that he went to bed to</span><br/>
<span id='94'>her very description.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>We shall have him here to-morrow with his best ruff on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>To-night, to-night. But, mistress, do you know the</span><br/>
<span id='97'>French knight that cowers i' the hams?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Who, Monsieur Veroles?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Ay, he: he offered to cut a caper at the</span><br/>
<span id='100'>proclamation; but he made a groan at it, and swore</span><br/>
<span id='101'>he would see her to-morrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Well, well; as for him, he brought his disease</span><br/>
<span id='103'>hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will</span><br/>
<span id='104'>come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the</span><br/>
<span id='105'>sun.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we</span><br/>
<span id='107'>should lodge them with this sign.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>[To MARINA]  Pray you, come hither awhile. You</span><br/>
<span id='109'>have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must</span><br/>
<span id='110'>seem to do that fearfully which you commit</span><br/>
<span id='111'>willingly, despise profit where you have most gain.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your</span><br/>
<span id='113'>lovers: seldom but that pity begets you a good</span><br/>
<span id='114'>opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>I understand you not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these</span><br/>
<span id='117'>blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Thou sayest true, i' faith, so they must; for your</span><br/>
<span id='119'>bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go</span><br/>
<span id='120'>with warrant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>'Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress, if</span><br/>
<span id='122'>I have bargained for the joint,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>I may so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Who should deny it? Come, young one, I like the</span><br/>
<span id='126'>manner of your garments well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Boult, spend thou that in the town: report what a</span><br/>
<span id='129'>sojourner we have; you'll lose nothing by custom.</span><br/>
<span id='130'>When nature flamed this piece, she meant thee a good</span><br/>
<span id='131'>turn; therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou</span><br/>
<span id='132'>hast the harvest out of thine own report.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>BOULT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake</span><br/>
<span id='134'>the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up</span><br/>
<span id='135'>the lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Come your ways; follow me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Diana, aid my purpose!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>Bawd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>What have we to do with Diana? Pray you, will you go with us?</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

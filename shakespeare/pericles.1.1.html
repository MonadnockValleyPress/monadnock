<h1>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h1>

<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Antioch. A room in the palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ANTIOCHUS, Prince PERICLES, and followers</em>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ANTIOCHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The danger of the task you undertake.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Think death no hazard in this enterprise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANTIOCHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>For the embracements even of Jove himself;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>The senate-house of planets all did sit,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To knit in her their best perfections.</span><br/>
<p><em>Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Of every virtue gives renown to men!</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Her face the book of praises, where is read</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Could never be her mild companion.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>You gods that made me man, and sway in love,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>That have inflamed desire in my breast</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Or die in the adventure, be my helps,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>As I am son and servant to your will,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>To compass such a boundless happiness!</span><br/>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ANTIOCHUS</strong></span>

<span id='25'>Prince Pericles,&mdash;</span><br/>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>That would be son to great Antiochus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ANTIOCHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Her countless glory, which desert must gain;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And which, without desert, because thine eye</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>That without covering, save yon field of stars,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist</span><br/>
<span id='40'>For going on death's net, whom none resist.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught</span><br/>
<span id='42'>My frail mortality to know itself,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And by those fearful objects to prepare</span><br/>
<span id='44'>This body, like to them, to what I must;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>For death remember'd should be like a mirror,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I'll make my will then, and, as sick men do</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>So I bequeath a happy peace to you</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And all good men, as every prince should do;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>My riches to the earth from whence they came;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>But my unspotted fire of love to you.</span><br/>
<p><em>To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</em></p>
<span id='54'>Thus ready for the way of life or death,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ANTIOCHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Daughter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!</span><br/>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Nor ask advice of any other thought</span><br/>
<span id='63'>But faithfulness and courage.</span><br/>
<p><em>He reads the riddle</em></p>
<span id='64'>I am no viper, yet I feed</span><br/>
<span id='65'>On mother's flesh which did me breed.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>I sought a husband, in which labour</span><br/>
<span id='67'>I found that kindness in a father:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>He's father, son, and husband mild;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>I mother, wife, and yet his child.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>How they may be, and yet in two,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>As you will live, resolve it you.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers</span><br/>
<span id='73'>That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,</span><br/>
<p><em>Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</em></p>
<span id='77'>Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt</span><br/>
<span id='79'>For he's no man on whom perfections wait</span><br/>
<span id='80'>That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>But being play'd upon before your time,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Good sooth, I care not for you.</span><br/>

<span id='87'>Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>For that's an article within our law,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:</span><br/>

<span id='92'>Few love to hear the sins they love to act;</span><br/>

<span id='94'>Who has a book of all that monarchs do,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.</span><br/>

<span id='98'>And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:</span><br/>

<span id='105'>And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?</span><br/>

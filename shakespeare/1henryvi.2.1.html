<h1>Henry VI, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Before Orleans.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter a Sergeant of a band with two Sentinels</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Sergeant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Sirs, take your places and be vigilant:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>If any noise or soldier you perceive</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Near to the walls, by some apparent sign</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Sentinel</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Sergeant, you shall.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Sergeant</em></p>
<span id='6'>Thus are poor servitors,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>When others sleep upon their quiet beds,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain and cold.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, and Forces, with scaling-ladders, their drums beating a dead march</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Lord Regent, and redoubted Burgundy,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>By whose approach the regions of Artois,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Wallon and Picardy are friends to us,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>This happy night the Frenchmen are secure,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Having all day caroused and banqueted:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Embrace we then this opportunity</span><br/>
<span id='15'>As fitting best to quittance their deceit</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Contrived by art and baleful sorcery.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Coward of France! how much he wrongs his fame,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Despairing of his own arm's fortitude,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>To join with witches and the help of hell!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Traitors have never other company.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>A maid, they say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>                  A maid! and be so martial!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>If underneath the standard of the French</span><br/>
<span id='26'>She carry armour as she hath begun.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Well, let them practise and converse with spirits:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>God is our fortress, in whose conquering name</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Ascend, brave Talbot; we will follow thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Not all together: better far, I guess,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>That we do make our entrance several ways;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>That, if it chance the one of us do fail,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>The other yet may rise against their force.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Agreed: I'll to yond corner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>And I to this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>And here will Talbot mount, or make his grave.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Of English Henry, shall this night appear</span><br/>
<span id='40'>How much in duty I am bound to both.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Sentinels</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Arm! arm! the enemy doth make assault!</span><br/>
<p><em>Cry: 'St. George,' 'A Talbot.'</em></p>
<p><em>The French leap over the walls in their shirts.  Enter, several ways, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, and REIGNIER, half ready, and half unready</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ALENCON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>How now, my lords! what, all unready so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>REIGNIER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Hearing alarums at our chamber-doors.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ALENCON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise</span><br/>
<span id='48'>More venturous or desperate than this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>REIGNIER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ALENCON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CHARLES and JOAN LA PUCELLE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CHARLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Make us partakers of a little gain,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>That now our loss might be ten times so much?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend!</span><br/>
<span id='58'>At all times will you have my power alike?</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CHARLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Duke of Alencon, this was your default,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>That, being captain of the watch to-night,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Did look no better to that weighty charge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ALENCON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Had all your quarters been as safely kept</span><br/>
<span id='67'>As that whereof I had the government,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>We had not been thus shamefully surprised.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Mine was secure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>REIGNIER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>                  And so was mine, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>CHARLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>And, for myself, most part of all this night,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Within her quarter and mine own precinct</span><br/>
<span id='73'>I was employ'd in passing to and fro,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>About relieving of the sentinels:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Then how or which way should they first break in?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Question, my lords, no further of the case,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>How or which way: 'tis sure they found some place</span><br/>
<span id='78'>But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>And now there rests no other shift but this;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispersed,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And lay new platforms to endamage them.</span><br/>
<p><em>Alarum. Enter an English Soldier, crying 'A  Talbot! a Talbot!' They fly, leaving their clothes behind</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>I'll be so bold to take what they have left.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>For I have loaden me with many spoils,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Using no other weapon but his name.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

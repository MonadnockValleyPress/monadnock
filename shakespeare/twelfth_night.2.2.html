<h4>A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter VIOLA, MALVOLIO following</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since</span><br/>
<span id='3'>arrived but hither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have</span><br/>
<span id='5'>saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord</span><br/>
<span id='7'>into a desperate assurance she will none of him:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to</span><br/>
<span id='9'>come again in his affairs, unless it be to report</span><br/>
<span id='10'>your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her</span><br/>
<span id='13'>will is, it should be so returned: if it be worth</span><br/>
<span id='14'>stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, be</span><br/>
<span id='15'>it his that finds it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>I left no ring with her: what means this lady?</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!</span><br/>
<span id='18'>She made good view of me; indeed, so much,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>For she did speak in starts distractedly.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Invites me in this churlish messenger.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Poor lady, she were better love a dream.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>How easy is it for the proper-false</span><br/>
<span id='29'>In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!</span><br/>
<span id='31'>For such as we are made of, such we be.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>What will become of this? As I am man,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>My state is desperate for my master's love;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>As I am woman,&mdash;now alas the day!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!</span><br/>
<span id='39'>O time! thou must untangle this, not I;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>It is too hard a knot for me to untie!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

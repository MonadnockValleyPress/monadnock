<h3>Act II, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter THERSITES, solus</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>THERSITES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>How now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth of</span><br/>
<span id='2'>thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He</span><br/>
<span id='3'>beats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!</span><br/>
<span id='4'>would it were otherwise; that I could beat him,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to</span><br/>
<span id='6'>conjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of</span><br/>
<span id='7'>my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, a</span><br/>
<span id='8'>rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two</span><br/>
<span id='9'>undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of</span><br/>
<span id='10'>themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy</span><br/>
<span id='13'>caduceus, if ye take not that little, little less</span><br/>
<span id='14'>than little wit from them that they have! which</span><br/>
<span id='15'>short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant</span><br/>
<span id='16'>scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly</span><br/>
<span id='17'>from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and</span><br/>
<span id='18'>cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the</span><br/>
<span id='19'>whole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>methinks, is the curse dependent on those that war</span><br/>
<span id='21'>for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy</span><br/>
<span id='22'>say Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PATROCLUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PATROCLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>THERSITES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thou</span><br/>
<span id='25'>wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but</span><br/>
<span id='26'>it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common</span><br/>
<span id='27'>curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in</span><br/>
<span id='28'>great revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, and</span><br/>
<span id='29'>discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy</span><br/>
<span id='30'>direction till thy death! then if she that lays thee</span><br/>
<span id='31'>out says thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn and</span><br/>
<span id='32'>sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Amen. Where's Achilles?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PATROCLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>What, art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>THERSITES</strong></span>

<span id='35'>Ay: the heavens hear me!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ACHILLES</em></p>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PATROCLUS</strong></span>

<span id='37'>Thersites, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ACHILLES</strong></span>

<span id='38'>Where, where? Art thou come? why, my cheese, my</span><br/>
<span id='39'>digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to</span><br/>
<span id='40'>my table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>THERSITES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>what's Achilles?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PATROCLUS</strong></span>

<span id='43'>Thy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee,</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Thy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>what art thou?</span><br/>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PATROCLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Thou mayst tell that knowest.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='48'>O, tell, tell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>THERSITES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>THERSITES</strong></span>

<span id='55'>Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites</span><br/>
<span id='56'>is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ACHILLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Derive this; come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>THERSITES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool, and</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Patroclus is a fool positive.</span><br/>

<span id='62'>Why am I a fool?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>THERSITES</strong></span>

<span id='63'>Make that demand of the prover. It suffices me thou</span><br/>

<span id='66'>Come in with me, Thersites.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>THERSITES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Here is such patchery, such juggling and such</span><br/>
<span id='68'>knavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a</span><br/>
<span id='69'>whore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factions</span><br/>
<span id='70'>and bleed to death upon. Now, the dry serpigo on</span><br/>

<span id='83'>Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call it</span><br/>

<span id='94'>All the better; their fraction is more our wish than</span><br/>

<span id='237'>Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure;</span><br/>
<span id='238'>Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:</span><br/>
<span id='239'>Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature</span><br/>
<span id='240'>Thrice famed, beyond all erudition:</span><br/>
<span id='241'>But he that disciplined thy arms to fight,</span><br/>
<span id='242'>Let Mars divide eternity in twain,</span><br/>
<span id='243'>And give him half: and, for thy vigour,</span><br/>
<span id='244'>Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield</span><br/>
<span id='245'>To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,</span><br/>
<span id='246'>Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines</span><br/>
<span id='247'>Thy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor;</span><br/>
<span id='248'>Instructed by the antiquary times,</span><br/>
<span id='249'>He must, he is, he cannot but be wise:</span><br/>
<span id='250'>Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days</span><br/>
<span id='251'>As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,</span><br/>
<span id='252'>You should not have the eminence of him,</span><br/>
<span id='253'>But be as Ajax.</span><br/>

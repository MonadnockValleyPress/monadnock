<blockquote>
<em>Enter KENT and OSWALD, severally</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Ay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Where may we set our horses?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>I' the mire.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>I love thee not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Why, then, I care not for thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee</span><br/>
<span id='9'>care for me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Fellow, I know thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>What dost thou know me for?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a</span><br/>
<span id='14'>base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a</span><br/>
<span id='16'>lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a</span><br/>
<span id='19'>bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but</span><br/>
<span id='20'>the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I</span><br/>
<span id='22'>will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest</span><br/>
<span id='23'>the least syllable of thy addition.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail</span><br/>
<span id='25'>on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou</span><br/>
<span id='27'>knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up</span><br/>
<span id='28'>thy heels, and beat thee before the king? Draw, you</span><br/>
<span id='29'>rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon</span><br/>
<span id='30'>shines; I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw.</span><br/>
<p><em>Drawing his sword</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Away! I have nothing to do with thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the</span><br/>
<span id='34'>king; and take vanity the puppet's part against the</span><br/>
<span id='35'>royalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I'll so</span><br/>
<span id='36'>carbonado your shanks: draw, you rascal; come your ways.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Help, ho! murder! help!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Strike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neat</span><br/>
<span id='39'>slave, strike.</span><br/>
<p><em>Beating him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Help, ho! murder! murder!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter EDMUND, with his rapier drawn, CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>How now! What's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>With you, goodman boy, an you please: come, I'll</span><br/>
<span id='43'>flesh ye; come on, young master.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Weapons! arms! What 's the matter here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Keep peace, upon your lives:</span><br/>
<span id='46'>He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>The messengers from our sister and the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>What is your difference? speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>I am scarce in breath, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You</span><br/>
<span id='51'>cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a</span><br/>
<span id='52'>tailor made thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or painter could</span><br/>
<span id='55'>not have made him so ill, though he had been but two</span><br/>
<span id='56'>hours at the trade.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared</span><br/>
<span id='59'>at suit of his gray beard,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My</span><br/>
<span id='61'>lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this</span><br/>
<span id='62'>unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall of</span><br/>
<span id='63'>a jakes with him. Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Peace, sirrah!</span><br/>
<span id='65'>You beastly knave, know you no reverence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Why art thou angry?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>That such a slave as this should wear a sword,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion</span><br/>
<span id='72'>That in the natures of their lords rebel;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks</span><br/>
<span id='75'>With every gale and vary of their masters,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>A plague upon your epileptic visage!</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Why, art thou mad, old fellow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>How fell you out? say that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>No contraries hold more antipathy</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Than I and such a knave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Why dost thou call him a knave?  What's his offence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>His countenance likes me not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>I have seen better faces in my time</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Than stands on any shoulder that I see</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Before me at this instant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>This is some fellow,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect</span><br/>
<span id='94'>A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!</span><br/>
<span id='97'>An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Than twenty silly ducking observants</span><br/>
<span id='101'>That stretch their duties nicely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Under the allowance of your great aspect,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire</span><br/>
<span id='105'>On flickering Phoebus' front,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>What mean'st by this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>To go out of my dialect, which you</span><br/>
<span id='108'>discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no</span><br/>
<span id='109'>flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain</span><br/>
<span id='110'>accent was a plain knave; which for my part</span><br/>
<span id='111'>I will not be, though I should win your displeasure</span><br/>
<span id='112'>to entreat me to 't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>What was the offence you gave him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>I never gave him any:</span><br/>
<span id='115'>It pleased the king his master very late</span><br/>
<span id='116'>To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And put upon him such a deal of man,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>That worthied him, got praises of the king</span><br/>
<span id='121'>For him attempting who was self-subdued;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Drew on me here again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>None of these rogues and cowards</span><br/>
<span id='125'>But Ajax is their fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Fetch forth the stocks!</span><br/>
<span id='127'>You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>We'll teach you&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>                  Sir, I am too old to learn:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>On whose employment I was sent to you:</span><br/>
<span id='132'>You shall do small respect, show too bold malice</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Against the grace and person of my master,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Stocking his messenger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>There shall he sit till noon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Till noon! till night, my lord; and all night too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>You should not use me so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Sir, being his knave, I will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>This is a fellow of the self-same colour</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!</span><br/>
<p><em>Stocks brought out</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Let me beseech your grace not to do so:</span><br/>
<span id='144'>His fault is much, and the good king his master</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Will cheque him for 't: your purposed low correction</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches</span><br/>
<span id='147'>For pilferings and most common trespasses</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>That he's so slightly valued in his messenger,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Should have him thus restrain'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>I'll answer that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>My sister may receive it much more worse,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>For following her affairs. Put in his legs.</span><br/>
<p><em>KENT is put in the stocks</em></p>
<span id='155'>Come, my good lord, away.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and KENT</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>I am sorry for thee, friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Whose disposition, all the world well knows,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd: I'll entreat for thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Pray, do not, sir: I have watched and travell'd hard;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.</span><br/>
<span id='161'>A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Give you good morrow!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>The duke's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Good king, that must approve the common saw,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Thou out of heaven's benediction comest</span><br/>
<span id='166'>To the warm sun!</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>That by thy comfortable beams I may</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Peruse this letter! Nothing almost sees miracles</span><br/>
<span id='170'>But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Who hath most fortunately been inform'd</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Of my obscured course; and shall find time</span><br/>
<span id='173'>From this enormous state, seeking to give</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Losses their remedies. All weary and o'erwatch'd,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold</span><br/>
<span id='176'>This shameful lodging.</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Fortune, good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel!</span><br/>
<p><em>Sleeps</em></p>

<blockquote>
<em>Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Servant</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He</span><br/>
<span id='2'>shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Servant</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's</span><br/>
<span id='4'>hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>First Servant</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Away with the joint-stools, remove the</span><br/>
<span id='6'>court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save</span><br/>
<span id='7'>me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let</span><br/>
<span id='8'>the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Antony, and Potpan!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Servant</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Ay, boy, ready.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Servant</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>You are looked for and called for, asked for and</span><br/>
<span id='12'>sought for, in the great chamber.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Second Servant</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be</span><br/>
<span id='14'>brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day</span><br/>
<span id='21'>That I have worn a visor and could tell</span><br/>
<span id='22'>A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.</span><br/>
<p><em>Music plays, and they dance</em></p>
<span id='26'>More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>For you and I are past our dancing days:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>How long is't now since last yourself and I</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Were in a mask?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Second Capulet</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>                  By'r lady, thirty years.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Come pentecost as quickly as it will,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Second Capulet</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>His son is thirty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>                  Will you tell me that?</span><br/>
<span id='41'>His son was but a ward two years ago.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>[To a Servingman]  What lady is that, which doth</span><br/>
<span id='43'>enrich the hand</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Of yonder knight?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Servant</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>I know not, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!</span><br/>
<span id='47'>It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!</span><br/>
<span id='50'>So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!</span><br/>
<span id='55'>For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TYBALT</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>This, by his voice, should be a Montague.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>TYBALT</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>A villain that is hither come in spite,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>To scorn at our solemnity this night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Young Romeo is it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>TYBALT</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>'Tis he, that villain Romeo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>He bears him like a portly gentleman;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And, to say truth, Verona brags of him</span><br/>
<span id='71'>To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>I would not for the wealth of all the town</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Here in my house do him disparagement:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Therefore be patient, take no note of him:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>It is my will, the which if thou respect,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>TYBALT</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>It fits, when such a villain is a guest:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>I'll not endure him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>He shall be endured:</span><br/>
<span id='81'>What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Am I the master here, or you? go to.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!</span><br/>
<span id='84'>You'll make a mutiny among my guests!</span><br/>
<span id='85'>You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>TYBALT</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Go to, go to;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?</span><br/>
<span id='89'>This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Be quiet, or&mdash;More light, more light! For shame!</span><br/>
<span id='93'>I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>TYBALT</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>[To JULIET]  If I profane with my unworthiest hand</span><br/>
<span id='99'>This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand</span><br/>
<span id='101'>To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Which mannerly devotion shows in this;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Then have my lips the sin that they have took.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Give me my sin again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>You kiss by the book.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>Nurse</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Madam, your mother craves a word with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>What is her mother?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>Nurse</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Marry, bachelor,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Her mother is the lady of the house,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous</span><br/>
<span id='122'>I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>I tell you, he that can lay hold of her</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Shall have the chinks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Is she a Capulet?</span><br/>
<span id='126'>O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Away, begone; the sport is at the best.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all</span><br/>
<span id='132'>I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.</span><br/>
<span id='133'>More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>I'll to my rest.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse</em></p>

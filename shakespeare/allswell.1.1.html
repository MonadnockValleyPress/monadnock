<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Rousillon. The Count's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death</span><br/>
<span id='3'>anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to</span><br/>
<span id='4'>whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times</span><br/>
<span id='7'>good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose</span><br/>
<span id='8'>worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather</span><br/>
<span id='9'>than lack it where there is such abundance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose</span><br/>
<span id='12'>practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and</span><br/>
<span id='13'>finds no other advantage in the process but only the</span><br/>
<span id='14'>losing of hope by time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>This young gentlewoman had a father,&mdash;O, that</span><br/>
<span id='16'>'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!&mdash;whose skill was</span><br/>
<span id='17'>almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so</span><br/>
<span id='18'>far, would have made nature immortal, and death</span><br/>
<span id='19'>should have play for lack of work. Would, for the</span><br/>
<span id='20'>king's sake, he were living! I think it would be</span><br/>
<span id='21'>the death of the king's disease.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>How called you the man you speak of, madam?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was</span><br/>
<span id='24'>his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very</span><br/>
<span id='26'>lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he</span><br/>
<span id='27'>was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge</span><br/>
<span id='28'>could be set up against mortality.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>A fistula, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>I heard not of it before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman</span><br/>
<span id='33'>the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my</span><br/>
<span id='35'>overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that</span><br/>
<span id='36'>her education promises; her dispositions she</span><br/>
<span id='37'>inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where</span><br/>
<span id='38'>an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there</span><br/>
<span id='39'>commendations go with pity; they are virtues and</span><br/>
<span id='40'>traitors too; in her they are the better for their</span><br/>
<span id='41'>simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise</span><br/>
<span id='44'>in. The remembrance of her father never approaches</span><br/>
<span id='45'>her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all</span><br/>
<span id='46'>livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect</span><br/>
<span id='48'>a sorrow than have it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>excessive grief the enemy to the living.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess</span><br/>
<span id='53'>makes it soon mortal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Madam, I desire your holy wishes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>How understand we that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father</span><br/>
<span id='57'>In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Advise him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>          He cannot want the best</span><br/>
<span id='69'>That shall attend his love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>[To HELENA]  The best wishes that can be forged in</span><br/>
<span id='72'>your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable</span><br/>
<span id='73'>to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of</span><br/>
<span id='75'>your father.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>O, were that all! I think not on my father;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And these great tears grace his remembrance more</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Than those I shed for him. What was he like?</span><br/>
<span id='79'>I have forgot him: my imagination</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>I am undone: there is no living, none,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one</span><br/>
<span id='83'>That I should love a bright particular star</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And think to wed it, he is so above me:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>In his bright radiance and collateral light</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.</span><br/>
<span id='87'>The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:</span><br/>
<span id='88'>The hind that would be mated by the lion</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>To see him every hour; to sit and draw</span><br/>
<span id='91'>His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>In our heart's table; heart too capable</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PAROLLES</em></p>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='96'>One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And yet I know him a notorious liar,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>That they take place, when virtue's steely bones</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Save you, fair queen!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>And you, monarch!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>No.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>And no.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Are you meditating on virginity?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me</span><br/>
<span id='109'>ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how</span><br/>
<span id='110'>may we barricado it against him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Keep him out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some</span><br/>
<span id='114'>warlike resistance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>There is none: man, sitting down before you, will</span><br/>
<span id='116'>undermine you and blow you up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Bless our poor virginity from underminers and</span><br/>
<span id='118'>blowers up! Is there no military policy, how</span><br/>
<span id='119'>virgins might blow up men?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be</span><br/>
<span id='121'>blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with</span><br/>
<span id='122'>the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It</span><br/>
<span id='123'>is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to</span><br/>
<span id='124'>preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational</span><br/>
<span id='125'>increase and there was never virgin got till</span><br/>
<span id='126'>virginity was first lost. That you were made of is</span><br/>
<span id='127'>metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost</span><br/>
<span id='128'>may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is</span><br/>
<span id='129'>ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the</span><br/>
<span id='132'>rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible</span><br/>
<span id='134'>disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>virginity murders itself and should be buried in</span><br/>
<span id='136'>highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate</span><br/>
<span id='137'>offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very</span><br/>
<span id='139'>paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of</span><br/>
<span id='141'>self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the</span><br/>
<span id='142'>canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose</span><br/>
<span id='143'>by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make</span><br/>
<span id='144'>itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the</span><br/>
<span id='145'>principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it</span><br/>
<span id='148'>likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with</span><br/>
<span id='149'>lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't</span><br/>
<span id='150'>while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out</span><br/>
<span id='152'>of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just</span><br/>
<span id='153'>like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not</span><br/>
<span id='154'>now. Your date is better in your pie and your</span><br/>
<span id='155'>porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>your old virginity, is like one of our French</span><br/>
<span id='157'>withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Not my virginity yet [         ]</span><br/>
<span id='161'>There shall your master have a thousand loves,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>A mother and a mistress and a friend,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>A phoenix, captain and an enemy,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>His humble ambition, proud humility,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='171'>I know not what he shall. God send him well!</span><br/>
<span id='172'>The court's a learning place, and he is one&mdash;</span><br/>

<span id='speech44'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>What one, i' faith?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>That I wish well. 'Tis pity&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>What's pity?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>That wishing well had not a body in't,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Might with effects of them follow our friends,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>And show what we alone must think, which never</span><br/>

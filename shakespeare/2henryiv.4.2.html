<h1>Henry IV, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene II</H3>
<h4>Another part of the forest.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter, from one side, MOWBRAY, attended; afterwards  the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, HASTINGS, and others: from  the other side, Prince John of LANCASTER, and WESTMORELAND; Officers, and others with them</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>You are well encounter'd here, my cousin Mowbray:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Good day to you, gentle lord archbishop;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.</span><br/>
<span id='4'>My Lord of York, it better show'd with you</span><br/>
<span id='5'>When that your flock, assembled by the bell,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Encircled you to hear with reverence</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Your exposition on the holy text</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Than now to see you here an iron man,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Turning the word to sword and life to death.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>That man that sits within a monarch's heart,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Would he abuse the countenance of the king,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Alack, what mischiefs might he set abrooch</span><br/>
<span id='15'>In shadow of such greatness! With you, lord bishop,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken</span><br/>
<span id='17'>How deep you were within the books of God?</span><br/>
<span id='18'>To us the speaker in his parliament;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>To us the imagined voice of God himself;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>The very opener and intelligencer</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And our dull workings. O, who shall believe</span><br/>
<span id='23'>But you misuse the reverence of your place,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>As a false favourite doth his prince's name,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Under the counterfeited zeal of God,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>The subjects of his substitute, my father,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And both against the peace of heaven and him</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Have here up-swarm'd them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Good my Lord of Lancaster,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>I am not here against your father's peace;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>But, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>To hold our safety up. I sent your grace</span><br/>
<span id='37'>The parcels and particulars of our grief,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep</span><br/>
<span id='41'>With grant of our most just and right desires,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And true obedience, of this madness cured,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>If not, we ready are to try our fortunes</span><br/>
<span id='45'>To the last man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>                  And though we here fall down,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>We have supplies to second our attempt:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And so success of mischief shall be born</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Whiles England shall have generation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>To sound the bottom of the after-times.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Pleaseth your grace to answer them directly</span><br/>
<span id='55'>How far forth you do like their articles.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>I like them all, and do allow them well,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And swear here, by the honour of my blood,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>My father's purposes have been mistook,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And some about him have too lavishly</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Wrested his meaning and authority.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Discharge your powers unto their several counties,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>As we will ours: and here between the armies</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Let's drink together friendly and embrace,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>That all their eyes may bear those tokens home</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Of our restored love and amity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>I take your princely word for these redresses.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>I give it you, and will maintain my word:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And thereupon I drink unto your grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Go, captain, and deliver to the army</span><br/>
<span id='72'>This news of peace: let them have pay, and part:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>I know it will well please them. Hie thee, captain.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Officer</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>I pledge your grace; and, if you knew what pains</span><br/>
<span id='76'>I have bestow'd to breed this present peace,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>You would drink freely: but my love to ye</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Shall show itself more openly hereafter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>I do not doubt you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>I am glad of it.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>You wish me health in very happy season;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>For I am, on the sudden, something ill.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Against ill chances men are ever merry;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>But heaviness foreruns the good event.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Serves to say thus, 'some good thing comes</span><br/>
<span id='88'>to-morrow.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>So much the worse, if your own rule be true.</span><br/>
<p><em>Shouts within</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>The word of peace is render'd: hark, how they shout!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>This had been cheerful after victory.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>A peace is of the nature of a conquest;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>For then both parties nobly are subdued,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And neither party loser.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Go, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And let our army be discharged too.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit WESTMORELAND</em></p>
<span id='98'>And, good my lord, so please you, let our trains</span><br/>
<span id='99'>March, by us, that we may peruse the men</span><br/>
<span id='100'>We should have coped withal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Go, good Lord Hastings,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>And, ere they be dismissed, let them march by.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit HASTINGS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>I trust, lords, we shall lie to-night together.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter WESTMORELAND</em></p>
<span id='104'>Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army still?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>The leaders, having charge from you to stand,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Will not go off until they hear you speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>They know their duties.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter HASTINGS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>My lord, our army is dispersed already;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Like youthful steers unyoked, they take their courses</span><br/>
<span id='110'>East, west, north, south; or, like a school broke up,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which</span><br/>
<span id='113'>I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And you, lord archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Of capitol treason I attach you both.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Is this proceeding just and honourable?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Is your assembly so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Will you thus break your faith?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>I pawn'd thee none:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>I promised you redress of these same grievances</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Whereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>I will perform with a most Christian care.</span><br/>
<span id='123'>But for you, rebels, look to taste the due</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours.</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Most shallowly did you these arms commence,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence.</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Strike up our drums, pursue the scatter'd stray:</span><br/>
<span id='128'>God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Some guard these traitors to the block of death,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Treason's true bed and yielder up of breath.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Henry VIII</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene V</h3>
<h4>The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter trumpets, sounding; then two Aldermen, Lord  Mayor, Garter, CRANMER, NORFOLK with his marshal's  staff, SUFFOLK, two Noblemen bearing great  standing-bowls for the christening-gifts; then  four Noblemen bearing a canopy, under which the  Duchess of Norfolk, godmother, bearing the child  richly habited in a mantle,  &amp;c., train borne by a  Lady; then follows the Marchioness Dorset, the  other godmother, and Ladies. The troop pass once about the stage, and Garter speaks</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Garter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Heaven, from thy endless goodness, send prosperous</span><br/>
<span id='2'>life, long, and ever happy, to the high and mighty</span><br/>
<span id='3'>princess of England, Elizabeth!</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VIII and Guard</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>[Kneeling] And to your royal grace, and the good queen,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>My noble partners, and myself, thus pray:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>May hourly fall upon ye!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Thank you, good lord archbishop:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>What is her name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>                  Elizabeth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Stand up, lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>KING HENRY VIII kisses the child</em></p>
<span id='13'>With this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee!</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Into whose hand I give thy life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Amen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>My noble gossips, ye have been too prodigal:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>When she has so much English.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Let me speak, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>This royal infant&mdash;heaven still move about her!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Though in her cradle, yet now promises</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>But few now living can behold that goodness&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>A pattern to all princes living with her,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And all that shall succeed: Saba was never</span><br/>
<span id='29'>More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>With all the virtues that attend the good,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>In her days every man shall eat in safety,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing</span><br/>
<span id='40'>The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>God shall be truly known; and those about her</span><br/>
<span id='42'>From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when</span><br/>
<span id='45'>The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Her ashes new create another heir,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>As great in admiration as herself;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>So shall she leave her blessedness to one,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Who from the sacred ashes of her honour</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>That were the servants to this chosen infant,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>His honour and the greatness of his name</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Shall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches</span><br/>
<span id='59'>To all the plains about him: our children's children</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Shall see this, and bless heaven.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Thou speakest wonders.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>She shall be, to the happiness of England,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>An aged princess; many days shall see her,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And yet no day without a deed to crown it.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Would I had known no more! but she must die,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>A most unspotted lily shall she pass</span><br/>
<span id='68'>To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>O lord archbishop,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Thou hast made me now a man! never, before</span><br/>
<span id='71'>This happy child, did I get any thing:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>That when I am in heaven I shall desire</span><br/>
<span id='74'>To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.</span><br/>
<span id='75'>I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And your good brethren, I am much beholding;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>I have received much honour by your presence,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>She will be sick else. This day, no man think</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Has business at his house; for all shall stay:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>This little one shall make it holiday.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h4>EPILOGUE</h4>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>'Tis ten to one this play can never please</span><br/>
<span id='84'>All that are here: some come to take their ease,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>We have frighted with our trumpets; so, 'tis clear,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>They'll say 'tis naught: others, to hear the city</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Abused extremely, and to cry 'That's witty!'</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Which we have not done neither: that, I fear,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>All the expected good we're like to hear</span><br/>
<span id='91'>For this play at this time, is only in</span><br/>
<span id='92'>The merciful construction of good women;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And say 'twill do, I know, within a while</span><br/>
<span id='95'>All the best men are ours; for 'tis ill hap,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.</span><br/>

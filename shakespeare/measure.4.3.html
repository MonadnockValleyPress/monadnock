<h3>Act IV, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Another room in the same.</h4>

<em>Enter POMPEY</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house</span><br/>
<span id='2'>of profession: one would think it were Mistress</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old</span><br/>
<span id='4'>customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in</span><br/>
<span id='5'>for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made</span><br/>
<span id='7'>five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not</span><br/>
<span id='8'>much in request, for the old women were all dead.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of</span><br/>
<span id='11'>peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a</span><br/>
<span id='12'>beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the</span><br/>
<span id='17'>great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in</span><br/>
<span id='19'>our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ABHORSON</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ABHORSON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Master Barnardine!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ABHORSON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>What, ho, Barnardine!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BARNARDINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>[Within]  A pox o' your throats! Who makes that</span><br/>
<span id='25'>noise there? What are you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so</span><br/>
<span id='27'>good, sir, to rise and be put to death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BARNARDINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>[Within]  Away, you rogue, away! I am sleepy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ABHORSON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are</span><br/>
<span id='31'>executed, and sleep afterwards.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ABHORSON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Go in to him, and fetch him out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ABHORSON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Very ready, sir.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BARNARDINE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BARNARDINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ABHORSON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your</span><br/>
<span id='38'>prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BARNARDINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not</span><br/>
<span id='40'>fitted for 't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the</span><br/>
<span id='43'>sounder all the next day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ABHORSON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do</span><br/>
<span id='45'>we jest now, think you?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily</span><br/>
<span id='47'>you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort</span><br/>
<span id='48'>you and pray with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BARNARDINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Friar, not I; I have been drinking hard all night,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>and I will have more time to prepare me, or they</span><br/>
<span id='51'>shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not</span><br/>
<span id='52'>consent to die this day, that's certain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Look forward on the journey you shall go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BARNARDINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>I swear I will not die to-day for any man's</span><br/>
<span id='56'>persuasion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>But hear you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BARNARDINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!</span><br/>
<span id='61'>After him, fellows; bring him to the block.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ABHORSON and POMPEY</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter Provost</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And to transport him in the mind he is</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Were damnable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>                  Here in the prison, father,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>There died this morning of a cruel fever</span><br/>
<span id='68'>One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Just of his colour. What if we do omit</span><br/>
<span id='71'>This reprobate till he were well inclined;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And satisfy the deputy with the visage</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And sent according to command; whiles I</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>This shall be done, good father, presently.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>But Barnardine must die this afternoon:</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And how shall we continue Claudio,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>To save me from the danger that might come</span><br/>
<span id='83'>If he were known alive?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Let this be done.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting</span><br/>
<span id='87'>To the under generation, you shall find</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Your safety manifested.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>I am your free dependant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Provost</em></p>
<span id='91'>Now will I write letters to Angelo,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Shall witness to him I am near at home,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And that, by great injunctions, I am bound</span><br/>
<span id='95'>To enter publicly: him I'll desire</span><br/>
<span id='96'>To meet me at the consecrated fount</span><br/>
<span id='97'>A league below the city; and from thence,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>By cold gradation and well-balanced form,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>We shall proceed with Angelo.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Provost</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Convenient is it. Make a swift return;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>For I would commune with you of such things</span><br/>
<span id='103'>That want no ear but yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>I'll make all speed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>[Within]  Peace, ho, be here!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know</span><br/>
<span id='107'>If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>But I will keep her ignorant of her good,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>To make her heavenly comforts of despair,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>When it is least expected.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ISABELLA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Ho, by your leave!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>The better, given me by so holy a man.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:</span><br/>
<span id='116'>His head is off and sent to Angelo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Nay, but it is not so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>In your close patience.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>You shall not be admitted to his sight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Injurious world! most damned Angelo!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Mark what I say, which you shall find</span><br/>
<span id='127'>By every syllable a faithful verity:</span><br/>
<span id='128'>The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>One of our convent, and his confessor,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Gives me this instance: already he hath carried</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Notice to Escalus and Angelo,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom</span><br/>
<span id='134'>In that good path that I would wish it go,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>And general honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>                  I am directed by you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;</span><br/>
<span id='140'>'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Say, by this token, I desire his company</span><br/>
<span id='142'>At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours</span><br/>
<span id='143'>I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>I am combined by a sacred vow</span><br/>
<span id='147'>And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Command these fretting waters from your eyes</span><br/>
<span id='149'>With a light heart; trust not my holy order,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>If I pervert your course. Who's here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LUCIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Good even. Friar, where's the provost?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Not within, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see</span><br/>
<span id='154'>thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain</span><br/>
<span id='155'>to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for</span><br/>
<span id='156'>my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set</span><br/>
<span id='157'>me to 't. But they say the duke will be here</span><br/>
<span id='158'>to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:</span><br/>
<span id='159'>if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been</span><br/>
<span id='160'>at home, he had lived.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit ISABELLA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your</span><br/>
<span id='162'>reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:</span><br/>
<span id='164'>he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee</span><br/>
<span id='167'>I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>You have told me too many of him already, sir, if</span><br/>
<span id='169'>they be true; if not true, none were enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>I was once before him for getting a wench with child.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Did you such a thing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Yes, marry, did I	but I was fain to forswear it;</span><br/>
<span id='173'>they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:</span><br/>
<span id='176'>if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of</span><br/>
<span id='177'>it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

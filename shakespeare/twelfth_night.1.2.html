<h1>Twelfth Night</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The sea-coast.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and Sailors</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>What country, friends, is this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Captain</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>This is Illyria, lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>And what should I do in Illyria?</span><br/>
<span id='4'>My brother he is in Elysium.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Captain</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>It is perchance that you yourself were saved.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Captain</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Assure yourself, after our ship did split,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>When you and those poor number saved with you</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Most provident in peril, bind himself,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves</span><br/>
<span id='17'>So long as I could see.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>For saying so, there's gold:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Whereto thy speech serves for authority,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>The like of him. Know'st thou this country?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Captain</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Not three hours' travel from this very place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Who governs here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Captain</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>A noble duke, in nature as in name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>What is the name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Captain</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Orsino.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Orsino! I have heard my father name him:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>He was a bachelor then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Captain</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>And so is now, or was so very late;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>For but a month ago I went from hence,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And then 'twas fresh in murmur,&mdash;as, you know,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>What great ones do the less will prattle of,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>What's she?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Captain</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count</span><br/>
<span id='37'>That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her</span><br/>
<span id='38'>In the protection of his son, her brother,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>They say, she hath abjured the company</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And sight of men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>                  O that I served that lady</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And might not be delivered to the world,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>What my estate is!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Captain</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>That were hard to compass;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Because she will admit no kind of suit,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>No, not the duke's.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And though that nature with a beauteous wall</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee</span><br/>
<span id='52'>I will believe thou hast a mind that suits</span><br/>
<span id='53'>With this thy fair and outward character.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Conceal me what I am, and be my aid</span><br/>
<span id='56'>For such disguise as haply shall become</span><br/>
<span id='57'>The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And speak to him in many sorts of music</span><br/>
<span id='61'>That will allow me very worth his service.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>What else may hap to time I will commit;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Captain</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>I thank thee: lead me on.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

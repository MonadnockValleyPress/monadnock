<h1>The Comedy of Errors</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>A public place.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Second Merchant, ANGELO, and an Officer</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Second Merchant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>You know since Pentecost the sum is due,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And since I have not much importuned you;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Nor now I had not, but that I am bound</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Therefore make present satisfaction,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Or I'll attach you by this officer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Even just the sum that I do owe to you</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Is growing to me by Antipholus,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And in the instant that I met with you</span><br/>
<span id='10'>He had of me a chain: at five o'clock</span><br/>
<span id='11'>I shall receive the money for the same.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>I will discharge my bond and thank you too.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus from the courtezan's</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>That labour may you save: see where he comes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Among my wife and her confederates,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>For locking me out of my doors by day.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>A man is well holp up that trusts to you:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>I promised your presence and the chain;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Belike you thought our love would last too long,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Saving your merry humour, here's the note</span><br/>
<span id='28'>How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Which doth amount to three odd ducats more</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Than I stand debted to this gentleman:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>I pray you, see him presently discharged,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>I am not furnish'd with the present money;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Besides, I have some business in the town.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Good signior, take the stranger to my house</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And with you take the chain and bid my wife</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Perchance I will be there as soon as you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Or else you may return without your money.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And I, to blame, have held him here too long.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>I should have chid you for not bringing it,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Second Merchant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>You hear how he importunes me;&mdash;the chain!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Either send the chain or send me by some token.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Second Merchant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>My business cannot brook this dalliance.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>If not, I'll leave him to the officer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I answer you! what should I answer you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>The money that you owe me for the chain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>I owe you none till I receive the chain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>You know I gave it you half an hour since.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Consider how it stands upon my credit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Second Merchant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>This touches me in reputation.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Either consent to pay this sum for me</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Or I attach you by this officer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Consent to pay thee that I never had!</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>I would not spare my brother in this case,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>If he should scorn me so apparently.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>I do obey thee till I give thee bail.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear</span><br/>
<span id='82'>As all the metal in your shop will answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To your notorious shame; I doubt it not.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DROMIO of Syracuse, from the bay</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum</span><br/>
<span id='86'>That stays but till her owner comes aboard,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought</span><br/>
<span id='89'>The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>The ship is in her trim; the merry wind</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all</span><br/>
<span id='92'>But for their owner, master, and yourself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And told thee to what purpose and what end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>You sent me for a rope's end as soon:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>I will debate this matter at more leisure</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And teach your ears to list me with more heed.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk</span><br/>
<span id='104'>That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Tell her I am arrested in the street</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone!</span><br/>
<span id='108'>On, officer, to prison till it come.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Second Merchant, Angelo, Officer, and Antipholus of Ephesus</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>To Adriana! that is where we dined,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:</span><br/>
<span id='111'>She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Thither I must, although against my will,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

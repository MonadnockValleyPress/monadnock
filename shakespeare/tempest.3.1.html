<h4>Before Prospero's cell.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>There be some sports are painful, and their labour</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Are nobly undergone and most poor matters</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Point to rich ends. This my mean task</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Would be as heavy to me as odious, but</span><br/>
<span id='6'>The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And he's composed of harshness. I must remove</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Had never like executor. I forget:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Most busy lest, when I do it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Alas, now, pray you,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Work not so hard: I would the lightning had</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>He's safe for these three hours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>O most dear mistress,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>The sun will set before I shall discharge</span><br/>
<span id='25'>What I must strive to do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>If you'll sit down,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I'll carry it to the pile.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>No, precious creature;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Than you should such dishonour undergo,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>While I sit lazy by.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>It would become me</span><br/>
<span id='34'>As well as it does you: and I should do it</span><br/>
<span id='35'>With much more ease; for my good will is to it,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And yours it is against.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Poor worm, thou art infected!</span><br/>
<span id='38'>This visitation shows it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>You look wearily.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>No, noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with me</span><br/>
<span id='41'>When you are by at night. I do beseech you&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>What is your name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>                  Miranda.&mdash;O my father,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>I have broke your hest to say so!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Admired Miranda!</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Indeed the top of admiration! worth</span><br/>
<span id='48'>What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady</span><br/>
<span id='49'>I have eyed with best regard and many a time</span><br/>
<span id='50'>The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Have I liked several women; never any</span><br/>
<span id='53'>With so fun soul, but some defect in her</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And put it to the foil: but you, O you,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>So perfect and so peerless, are created</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Of every creature's best!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>I do not know</span><br/>
<span id='59'>One of my sex; no woman's face remember,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen</span><br/>
<span id='61'>More that I may call men than you, good friend,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And my dear father: how features are abroad,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>The jewel in my dower, I would not wish</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Any companion in the world but you,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Nor can imagination form a shape,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Something too wildly and my father's precepts</span><br/>
<span id='69'>I therein do forget.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>I am in my condition</span><br/>
<span id='71'>A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>I would, not so!&mdash;and would no more endure</span><br/>
<span id='73'>This wooden slavery than to suffer</span><br/>
<span id='74'>The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>The very instant that I saw you, did</span><br/>
<span id='76'>My heart fly to your service; there resides,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>To make me slave to it; and for your sake</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Am I this patient log&mdash;man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Do you love me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And crown what I profess with kind event</span><br/>
<span id='82'>If I speak true! if hollowly, invert</span><br/>
<span id='83'>What best is boded me to mischief! I</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Beyond all limit of what else i' the world</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Do love, prize, honour you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>I am a fool</span><br/>
<span id='87'>To weep at what I am glad of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Fair encounter</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace</span><br/>
<span id='90'>On that which breeds between 'em!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Wherefore weep you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>At mine unworthiness that dare not offer</span><br/>
<span id='93'>What I desire to give, and much less take</span><br/>
<span id='94'>What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And all the more it seeks to hide itself,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!</span><br/>
<span id='98'>I am your wife, if you will marry me;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow</span><br/>
<span id='100'>You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Whether you will or no.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>My mistress, dearest;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And I thus humble ever.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>My husband, then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Ay, with a heart as willing</span><br/>
<span id='106'>As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>And mine, with my heart in't; and now farewell</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Till half an hour hence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>A thousand thousand!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>So glad of this as they I cannot be,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing</span><br/>
<span id='112'>At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>For yet ere supper-time must I perform</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Much business appertaining.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

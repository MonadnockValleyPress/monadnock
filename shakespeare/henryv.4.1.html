<h1>Henry V</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>The English camp at Agincourt.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING HENRY, BEDFORD, and GLOUCESTER</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The greater therefore should our courage be.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!</span><br/>
<span id='4'>There is some soul of goodness in things evil,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Would men observingly distil it out.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Which is both healthful and good husbandry:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Besides, they are our outward consciences,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And preachers to us all, admonishing</span><br/>
<span id='10'>That we should dress us fairly for our end.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Thus may we gather honey from the weed,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And make a moral of the devil himself.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ERPINGHAM</em></p>
<span id='13'>Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>A good soft pillow for that good white head</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Were better than a churlish turf of France.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ERPINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Not so, my liege: this lodging likes me better,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Since I may say 'Now lie I like a king.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>'Tis good for men to love their present pains</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Upon example; so the spirit is eased:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And when the mind is quicken'd, out of doubt,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>The organs, though defunct and dead before,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Break up their drowsy grave and newly move,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>With casted slough and fresh legerity.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Commend me to the princes in our camp;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Do my good morrow to them, and anon</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Desire them all to my pavilion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>We shall, my liege.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ERPINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Shall I attend your grace?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>No, my good knight;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Go with my brothers to my lords of England:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>I and my bosom must debate awhile,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And then I would no other company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ERPINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but KING HENRY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>God-a-mercy, old heart! thou speak'st cheerfully.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PISTOL</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Qui va la?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>A friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Discuss unto me; art thou officer?</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Or art thou base, common and popular?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>I am a gentleman of a company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Trail'st thou the puissant pike?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Even so. What are you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>As good a gentleman as the emperor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Then you are a better than the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>The king's a bawcock, and a heart of gold,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>A lad of life, an imp of fame;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Of parents good, of fist most valiant.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heart-string</span><br/>
<span id='49'>I love the lovely bully. What is thy name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Harry le Roy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Le Roy! a Cornish name: art thou of Cornish crew?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>No, I am a Welshman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Know'st thou Fluellen?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Yes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Tell him, I'll knock his leek about his pate</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Upon Saint Davy's day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>lest he knock that about yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Art thou his friend?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>And his kinsman too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>The figo for thee, then!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I thank you: God be with you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>My name is Pistol call'd.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>It sorts well with your fierceness.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>GOWER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Captain Fluellen!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>So! in the name of Jesu Christ, speak lower. It is</span><br/>
<span id='67'>the greatest admiration of the universal world, when</span><br/>
<span id='68'>the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the</span><br/>
<span id='69'>wars is not kept: if you would take the pains but to</span><br/>
<span id='70'>examine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shall</span><br/>
<span id='71'>find, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle toddle</span><br/>
<span id='72'>nor pibble pabble in Pompey's camp; I warrant you,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>you shall find the ceremonies of the wars, and the</span><br/>
<span id='74'>cares of it, and the forms of it, and the sobriety</span><br/>
<span id='75'>of it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>GOWER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Why, the enemy is loud; you hear him all night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating</span><br/>
<span id='78'>coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>look you, be an ass and a fool and a prating</span><br/>
<span id='80'>coxcomb? in your own conscience, now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>GOWER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>I will speak lower.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>I pray you and beseech you that you will.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt GOWER and FLUELLEN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Though it appear a little out of fashion,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>There is much care and valour in this Welshman.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter three soldiers, JOHN BATES, ALEXANDER COURT, and MICHAEL WILLIAMS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>COURT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which</span><br/>
<span id='86'>breaks yonder?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>BATES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>I think it be: but we have no great cause to desire</span><br/>
<span id='88'>the approach of day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>WILLIAMS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think</span><br/>
<span id='90'>we shall never see the end of it. Who goes there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>A friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>WILLIAMS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Under what captain serve you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>WILLIAMS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I</span><br/>
<span id='95'>pray you, what thinks he of our estate?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be</span><br/>
<span id='97'>washed off the next tide.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BATES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>He hath not told his thought to the king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I</span><br/>
<span id='100'>speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I</span><br/>
<span id='101'>am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the</span><br/>
<span id='102'>element shows to him as it doth to me; all his</span><br/>
<span id='103'>senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies</span><br/>
<span id='104'>laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and</span><br/>
<span id='105'>though his affections are higher mounted than ours,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like</span><br/>
<span id='107'>wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we</span><br/>
<span id='108'>do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish</span><br/>
<span id='109'>as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess</span><br/>
<span id='110'>him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing</span><br/>
<span id='111'>it, should dishearten his army.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BATES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>He may show what outward courage he will; but I</span><br/>
<span id='113'>believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish</span><br/>
<span id='114'>himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he</span><br/>
<span id='115'>were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>I think he would not wish himself any where but</span><br/>
<span id='118'>where he is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>BATES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Then I would he were here alone; so should he be</span><br/>
<span id='120'>sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here</span><br/>
<span id='122'>alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's</span><br/>
<span id='123'>minds: methinks I could not die any where so</span><br/>
<span id='124'>contented as in the king's company; his cause being</span><br/>
<span id='125'>just and his quarrel honourable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>WILLIAMS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>That's more than we know.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>BATES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know</span><br/>
<span id='128'>enough, if we know we are the king's subjects: if</span><br/>
<span id='129'>his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes</span><br/>
<span id='130'>the crime of it out of us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>WILLIAMS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath</span><br/>
<span id='132'>a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and</span><br/>
<span id='133'>arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join</span><br/>
<span id='134'>together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at</span><br/>
<span id='135'>such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a</span><br/>
<span id='136'>surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind</span><br/>
<span id='137'>them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their</span><br/>
<span id='138'>children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die</span><br/>
<span id='139'>well that die in a battle; for how can they</span><br/>
<span id='140'>charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their</span><br/>
<span id='141'>argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it</span><br/>
<span id='142'>will be a black matter for the king that led them to</span><br/>
<span id='143'>it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of</span><br/>
<span id='144'>subjection.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>So, if a son that is by his father sent about</span><br/>
<span id='146'>merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the</span><br/>
<span id='147'>imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be</span><br/>
<span id='148'>imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a</span><br/>
<span id='149'>servant, under his master's command transporting a</span><br/>
<span id='150'>sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in</span><br/>
<span id='151'>many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the</span><br/>
<span id='152'>business of the master the author of the servant's</span><br/>
<span id='153'>damnation: but this is not so: the king is not</span><br/>
<span id='154'>bound to answer the particular endings of his</span><br/>
<span id='155'>soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of</span><br/>
<span id='156'>his servant; for they purpose not their death, when</span><br/>
<span id='157'>they purpose their services. Besides, there is no</span><br/>
<span id='158'>king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to</span><br/>
<span id='159'>the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all</span><br/>
<span id='160'>unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them</span><br/>
<span id='161'>the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;</span><br/>
<span id='162'>some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of</span><br/>
<span id='163'>perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that</span><br/>
<span id='164'>have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with</span><br/>
<span id='165'>pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have</span><br/>
<span id='166'>defeated the law and outrun native punishment,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to</span><br/>
<span id='168'>fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>so that here men are punished for before-breach of</span><br/>
<span id='170'>the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where</span><br/>
<span id='171'>they feared the death, they have borne life away;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>and where they would be safe, they perish: then if</span><br/>
<span id='173'>they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of</span><br/>
<span id='174'>their damnation than he was before guilty of those</span><br/>
<span id='175'>impieties for the which they are now visited. Every</span><br/>
<span id='176'>subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's</span><br/>
<span id='177'>soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in</span><br/>
<span id='178'>the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every</span><br/>
<span id='179'>mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death</span><br/>
<span id='180'>is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was</span><br/>
<span id='181'>blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:</span><br/>
<span id='182'>and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think</span><br/>
<span id='183'>that, making God so free an offer, He let him</span><br/>
<span id='184'>outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach</span><br/>
<span id='185'>others how they should prepare.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>WILLIAMS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon</span><br/>
<span id='187'>his own head, the king is not to answer it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>BATES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>But I do not desire he should answer for me; and</span><br/>
<span id='189'>yet I determine to fight lustily for him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>WILLIAMS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but</span><br/>
<span id='192'>when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we</span><br/>
<span id='193'>ne'er the wiser.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>WILLIAMS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of an</span><br/>
<span id='196'>elder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can</span><br/>
<span id='197'>do against a monarch! you may as well go about to</span><br/>
<span id='198'>turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a</span><br/>
<span id='199'>peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word</span><br/>
<span id='200'>after! come, 'tis a foolish saying.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>Your reproof is something too round: I should be</span><br/>
<span id='202'>angry with you, if the time were convenient.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>WILLIAMS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>I embrace it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>WILLIAMS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>How shall I know thee again?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my</span><br/>
<span id='207'>bonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, I</span><br/>
<span id='208'>will make it my quarrel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>WILLIAMS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='209'>Here's my glove: give me another of thine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>There.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>WILLIAMS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='211'>This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou come</span><br/>
<span id='212'>to me and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,'</span><br/>
<span id='213'>by this hand, I will take thee a box on the ear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>WILLIAMS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='215'>Thou darest as well be hanged.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>Well. I will do it, though I take thee in the</span><br/>
<span id='217'>king's company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>WILLIAMS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>Keep thy word: fare thee well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>BATES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='219'>Be friends, you English fools, be friends: we have</span><br/>
<span id='220'>French quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to</span><br/>
<span id='222'>one, they will beat us; for they bear them on their</span><br/>
<span id='223'>shoulders: but it is no English treason to cut</span><br/>
<span id='224'>French crowns, and to-morrow the king himself will</span><br/>
<span id='225'>be a clipper.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt soldiers</em></p>
<span id='226'>Upon the king! let us our lives, our souls,</span><br/>
<span id='227'>Our debts, our careful wives,</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Our children and our sins lay on the king!</span><br/>
<span id='229'>We must bear all. O hard condition,</span><br/>
<span id='230'>Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel</span><br/>
<span id='232'>But his own wringing! What infinite heart's-ease</span><br/>
<span id='233'>Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy!</span><br/>
<span id='234'>And what have kings, that privates have not too,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>Save ceremony, save general ceremony?</span><br/>
<span id='236'>And what art thou, thou idle ceremony?</span><br/>
<span id='237'>What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st more</span><br/>
<span id='238'>Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?</span><br/>
<span id='239'>What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?</span><br/>
<span id='240'>O ceremony, show me but thy worth!</span><br/>
<span id='241'>What is thy soul of adoration?</span><br/>
<span id='242'>Art thou aught else but place, degree and form,</span><br/>
<span id='243'>Creating awe and fear in other men?</span><br/>
<span id='244'>Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd</span><br/>
<span id='245'>Than they in fearing.</span><br/>
<span id='246'>What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,</span><br/>
<span id='247'>But poison'd flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,</span><br/>
<span id='248'>And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!</span><br/>
<span id='249'>Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out</span><br/>
<span id='250'>With titles blown from adulation?</span><br/>
<span id='251'>Will it give place to flexure and low bending?</span><br/>
<span id='252'>Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,</span><br/>
<span id='253'>Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,</span><br/>
<span id='254'>That play'st so subtly with a king's repose;</span><br/>
<span id='255'>I am a king that find thee, and I know</span><br/>
<span id='256'>'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,</span><br/>
<span id='257'>The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,</span><br/>
<span id='258'>The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,</span><br/>
<span id='259'>The farced title running 'fore the king,</span><br/>
<span id='260'>The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp</span><br/>
<span id='261'>That beats upon the high shore of this world,</span><br/>
<span id='262'>No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,</span><br/>
<span id='263'>Not all these, laid in bed majestical,</span><br/>
<span id='264'>Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,</span><br/>
<span id='265'>Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind</span><br/>
<span id='266'>Gets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread;</span><br/>
<span id='267'>Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,</span><br/>
<span id='268'>But, like a lackey, from the rise to set</span><br/>
<span id='269'>Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night</span><br/>
<span id='270'>Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,</span><br/>
<span id='271'>Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,</span><br/>
<span id='272'>And follows so the ever-running year,</span><br/>
<span id='273'>With profitable labour, to his grave:</span><br/>
<span id='274'>And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,</span><br/>
<span id='275'>Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,</span><br/>
<span id='276'>Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.</span><br/>
<span id='277'>The slave, a member of the country's peace,</span><br/>
<span id='278'>Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots</span><br/>
<span id='279'>What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,</span><br/>
<span id='280'>Whose hours the peasant best advantages.</span><br/>

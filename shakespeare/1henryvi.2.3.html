<h1>Henry VI, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Auvergne. The Countess's castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the COUNTESS and her Porter</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Porter, remember what I gave in charge;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And when you have done so, bring the keys to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Porter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Madam, I will.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>The plot is laid: if all things fall out right,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I shall as famous be by this exploit</span><br/>
<span id='6'>As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And his achievements of no less account:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To give their censure of these rare reports.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Messenger and TALBOT</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Madam,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>According as your ladyship desired,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>And he is welcome. What! is this the man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Madam, it is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>                  Is this the scourge of France?</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad</span><br/>
<span id='18'>That with his name the mothers still their babes?</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I see report is fabulous and false:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>I thought I should have seen some Hercules,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>A second Hector, for his grim aspect,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!</span><br/>
<span id='24'>It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Should strike such terror to his enemies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Madam, I have been bold to trouble you;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>But since your ladyship is not at leisure,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I'll sort some other time to visit you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves</span><br/>
<span id='31'>To know the cause of your abrupt departure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>I go to certify her Talbot's here.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Porter with keys</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>If thou be he, then art thou prisoner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Prisoner! to whom?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>To me, blood-thirsty lord;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And for that cause I trained thee to my house.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>For in my gallery thy picture hangs:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>But now the substance shall endure the like,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>That hast by tyranny these many years</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Wasted our country, slain our citizens</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And sent our sons and husbands captivate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Ha, ha, ha!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>I laugh to see your ladyship so fond</span><br/>
<span id='48'>To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Whereon to practise your severity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Why, art not thou the man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>I am indeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Then have I substance too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>No, no, I am but shadow of myself:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>You are deceived, my substance is not here;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>For what you see is but the smallest part</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And least proportion of humanity:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Your roof were not sufficient to contain't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>This is a riddling merchant for the nonce;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>He will be here, and yet he is not here:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>How can these contrarieties agree?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>That will I show you presently.</span><br/>
<p><em>Winds his horn. Drums strike up: a peal of ordnance. Enter soldiers</em></p>
<span id='64'>How say you, madam? are you now persuaded</span><br/>
<span id='65'>That Talbot is but shadow of himself?</span><br/>
<span id='66'>These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Razeth your cities and subverts your towns</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And in a moment makes them desolate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And more than may be gather'd by thy shape.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>For I am sorry that with reverence</span><br/>
<span id='75'>I did not entertain thee as thou art.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconstrue</span><br/>
<span id='77'>The mind of Talbot, as you did mistake</span><br/>
<span id='78'>The outward composition of his body.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>What you have done hath not offended me;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Nor other satisfaction do I crave,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>But only, with your patience, that we may</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Taste of your wine and see what cates you have;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>COUNTESS OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>With all my heart, and think me honoured</span><br/>
<span id='85'>To feast so great a warrior in my house.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Henry VI, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Auvergne. The Countess's castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the COUNTESS and her Porter</em>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>COUNTESS</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Porter, remember what I gave in charge;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And when you have done so, bring the keys to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Porter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Madam, I will.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<span id='5'>COUNTESS</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>The plot is laid: if all things fall out right,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>I shall as famous be by this exploit</span><br/>
<span id='8'>As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And his achievements of no less account:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>To give their censure of these rare reports.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Messenger and TALBOT</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Madam,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>According as your ladyship desired,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>COUNTESS</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>And he is welcome. What! is this the man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Madam, it is.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>COUNTESS</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>                  Is this the scourge of France?</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad</span><br/>
<span id='22'>That with his name the mothers still their babes?</span><br/>
<span id='23'>I see report is fabulous and false:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I thought I should have seen some Hercules,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>A second Hector, for his grim aspect,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!</span><br/>
<span id='28'>It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Should strike such terror to his enemies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Madam, I have been bold to trouble you;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>But since your ladyship is not at leisure,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>I'll sort some other time to visit you.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>COUNTESS</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves</span><br/>
<span id='36'>To know the cause of your abrupt departure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>I go to certify her Talbot's here.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Porter with keys</em></p>
<span id='39'>COUNTESS</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>If thou be he, then art thou prisoner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Prisoner! to whom?</span><br/>
<span id='42'>COUNTESS</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>To me, blood-thirsty lord;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And for that cause I trained thee to my house.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>For in my gallery thy picture hangs:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>But now the substance shall endure the like,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>That hast by tyranny these many years</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Wasted our country, slain our citizens</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And sent our sons and husbands captivate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Ha, ha, ha!</span><br/>
<span id='53'>COUNTESS</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>I laugh to see your ladyship so fond</span><br/>
<span id='56'>To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Whereon to practise your severity.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>COUNTESS</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Why, art not thou the man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>I am indeed.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>COUNTESS</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Then have I substance too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>No, no, I am but shadow of myself:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>You are deceived, my substance is not here;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>For what you see is but the smallest part</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And least proportion of humanity:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Your roof were not sufficient to contain't.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>COUNTESS</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>This is a riddling merchant for the nonce;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>He will be here, and yet he is not here:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>How can these contrarieties agree?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>That will I show you presently.</span><br/>
<p><em>Winds his horn. Drums strike up: a peal of ordnance. Enter soldiers</em></p>
<span id='75'>How say you, madam? are you now persuaded</span><br/>
<span id='76'>That Talbot is but shadow of himself?</span><br/>
<span id='77'>These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Razeth your cities and subverts your towns</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And in a moment makes them desolate.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>COUNTESS</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And more than may be gather'd by thy shape.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>For I am sorry that with reverence</span><br/>
<span id='87'>I did not entertain thee as thou art.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>TALBOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconstrue</span><br/>
<span id='89'>The mind of Talbot, as you did mistake</span><br/>
<span id='90'>The outward composition of his body.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>What you have done hath not offended me;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Nor other satisfaction do I crave,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>But only, with your patience, that we may</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Taste of your wine and see what cates you have;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>COUNTESS</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>OF AUVERGNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>With all my heart, and think me honoured</span><br/>
<span id='98'>To feast so great a warrior in my house.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

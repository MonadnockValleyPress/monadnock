<h3>Act II, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>The Boar's-Head Tavern, Eastcheap.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me</span><br/>
<span id='2'>thy hand to laugh a little.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Where hast been, Hal?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four</span><br/>
<span id='5'>score hogsheads. I have sounded the very</span><br/>
<span id='6'>base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother</span><br/>
<span id='7'>to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by</span><br/>
<span id='8'>their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>They take it already upon their salvation, that</span><br/>
<span id='10'>though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king</span><br/>
<span id='11'>of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a</span><br/>
<span id='13'>good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I</span><br/>
<span id='14'>am king of England, I shall command all the good</span><br/>
<span id='15'>lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing</span><br/>
<span id='16'>scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they</span><br/>
<span id='17'>cry  'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I</span><br/>
<span id='18'>am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>that I can drink with any tinker in his own language</span><br/>
<span id='20'>during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost</span><br/>
<span id='21'>much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet</span><br/>
<span id='22'>action. But, sweet Ned,&mdash;to sweeten which name of</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped</span><br/>
<span id='24'>even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that</span><br/>
<span id='25'>never spake other English in his life than 'Eight</span><br/>
<span id='26'>shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with</span><br/>
<span id='27'>this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint</span><br/>
<span id='28'>of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to</span><br/>
<span id='29'>drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my</span><br/>
<span id='31'>puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do</span><br/>
<span id='32'>thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale</span><br/>
<span id='33'>to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and</span><br/>
<span id='34'>I'll show thee a precedent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Francis!</span><br/>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Thou art perfect.</span><br/>

<span id='speech6'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Francis!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit POINS</em></p>
<p><em>Enter FRANCIS</em></p>

<span id='speech7'><strong>FRANCIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Come hither, Francis.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>FRANCIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>My lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>How long hast thou to serve, Francis?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>FRANCIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Forsooth, five years, and as much as to&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>[Within]  Francis!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>FRANCIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Anon, anon, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Five year! by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking</span><br/>
<span id='46'>of pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant</span><br/>
<span id='47'>as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it</span><br/>
<span id='48'>a fair pair of heels and run from it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>FRANCIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in</span><br/>
<span id='50'>England, I could find in my heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>POINS</strong></a>

<span id='53'>How old art thou, Francis?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>FRANCIS</strong></a>

<span id='54'>Let me see&mdash;about Michaelmas next I shall be&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>[Within]  Francis!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>FRANCIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Nay, but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou</span><br/>
<span id='58'>gavest me,'twas a pennyworth, wast't not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>FRANCIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>O Lord, I would it had been two!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>I will give thee for it a thousand pound: ask me</span><br/>
<span id='61'>when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>[Within]  Francis!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>FRANCIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Anon, anon.</span><br/>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Anon, Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>or, Francis, o' Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when</span><br/>
<span id='66'>thou wilt. But, Francis!</span><br/>

<span id='speech28'><strong>FRANCIS</strong></a>

<span id='67'>My lord?</span><br/>

<span id='68'>Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>FRANCIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>O Lord, sir, who do you mean?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Why, then, your brown bastard is your only drink;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet</span><br/>
<span id='74'>will sully: in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>FRANCIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>What, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>[Within]  Francis!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them call?</span><br/>
<p><em>Here they both call him; the drawer stands amazed, not knowing which way to go</em></p>
<p><em>Enter Vintner</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>Vintner</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>What, standest thou still, and hearest such a</span><br/>
<span id='79'>calling? Look to the guests within.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Francis</em></p>
<span id='80'>My lord, old Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are</span><br/>
<span id='81'>at the door: shall I let them in?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Let them alone awhile, and then open the door.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Vintner</em></p>

<p><em>Re-enter POINS</em></p>

<span id='84'>Anon, anon, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at</span><br/>
<span id='86'>the door: shall we be merry?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what</span><br/>
<span id='88'>cunning match have you made with this jest of the</span><br/>
<span id='89'>drawer? come, what's the issue?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>I am now of all humours that have showed themselves</span><br/>
<span id='91'>humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the</span><br/>
<span id='92'>pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter FRANCIS</em></p>
<span id='93'>What's o'clock, Francis?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>FRANCIS</strong></a>

<span id='94'>Anon, anon, sir.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a</span><br/>
<span id='96'>parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is</span><br/>
<span id='97'>upstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of</span><br/>
<span id='98'>a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's mind, the</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or</span><br/>
<span id='100'>seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his</span><br/>
<span id='101'>hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet</span><br/>
<span id='102'>life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>'how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan</span><br/>
<span id='104'>horse a drench,' says he; and answers 'Some</span><br/>
<span id='105'>fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I</span><br/>
<span id='106'>prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and</span><br/>
<span id='107'>that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his</span><br/>
<span id='108'>wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter FALSTAFF, GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO; FRANCIS following with wine</em></p>

<span id='speech43'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!</span><br/>
<span id='111'>marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I</span><br/>
<span id='112'>lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend</span><br/>
<span id='113'>them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards!</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?</span><br/>
<p><em>He drinks</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?</span><br/>
<span id='116'>pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale</span><br/>
<span id='117'>of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is</span><br/>
<span id='119'>nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime</span><br/>
<span id='121'>in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be</span><br/>
<span id='123'>not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a</span><br/>
<span id='124'>shotten herring. There live not three good men</span><br/>
<span id='125'>unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and</span><br/>
<span id='126'>grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say.</span><br/>
<span id='127'>I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any</span><br/>
<span id='128'>thing. A plague of all cowards, I say still.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>How now, wool-sack! what mutter you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy</span><br/>
<span id='131'>kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy</span><br/>
<span id='132'>subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!</span><br/>

<span id='speech49'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>'Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Lord, I'll stab thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call</span><br/>
<span id='139'>thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I</span><br/>
<span id='140'>could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight</span><br/>
<span id='141'>enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your</span><br/>
<span id='142'>back: call you that backing of your friends? A</span><br/>
<span id='143'>plague upon such backing! give me them that will</span><br/>
<span id='144'>face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I</span><br/>
<span id='145'>drunk to-day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou</span><br/>
<span id='147'>drunkest last.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>All's one for that.</span><br/>
<p><em>He drinks</em></p>
<span id='149'>A plague of all cowards, still say I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>What's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>What's the matter! there be four of us here have</span><br/>
<span id='152'>ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Where is it, Jack? where is it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon</span><br/>
<span id='155'>poor four of us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>What, a hundred, man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a</span><br/>
<span id='158'>dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by</span><br/>
<span id='159'>miracle. I am eight times thrust through the</span><br/>
<span id='160'>doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut</span><br/>
<span id='161'>through and through; my sword hacked like a</span><br/>
<span id='162'>hand-saw&mdash;ecce signum! I never dealt better since</span><br/>
<span id='163'>I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all</span><br/>
<span id='164'>cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or</span><br/>
<span id='165'>less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Speak, sirs; how was it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>GADSHILL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>We four set upon some dozen&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Sixteen at least, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>GADSHILL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>And bound them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>PETO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>No, no, they were not bound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I</span><br/>
<span id='172'>am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>GADSHILL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>What, fought you with them all?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought</span><br/>
<span id='177'>not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if</span><br/>
<span id='178'>there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Pray God you have not murdered some of them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two</span><br/>
<span id='182'>of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues</span><br/>
<span id='183'>in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell</span><br/>
<span id='184'>thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou</span><br/>
<span id='185'>knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my</span><br/>
<span id='186'>point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>What, four? thou saidst but two even now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Four, Hal; I told thee four.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>Ay, ay, he said four.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at</span><br/>
<span id='191'>me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven</span><br/>
<span id='192'>points in my target, thus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>Seven? why, there were but four even now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>In buckram?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>Ay, four, in buckram suits.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>Dost thou hear me, Hal?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine</span><br/>
<span id='201'>in buckram that I told thee of&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>So, two more already.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>Their points being broken,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>Down fell their hose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of</span><br/>
<span id='207'>the eleven I paid.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech89'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech90'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='209'>But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten</span><br/>
<span id='210'>knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive</span><br/>
<span id='211'>at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst</span><br/>
<span id='212'>not see thy hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech91'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='213'>These lies are like their father that begets them;</span><br/>
<span id='214'>gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou</span><br/>
<span id='215'>clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou</span><br/>
<span id='216'>whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech92'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth</span><br/>
<span id='218'>the truth?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech93'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='219'>Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal</span><br/>
<span id='220'>green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy</span><br/>
<span id='221'>hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?</span><br/>

<span id='465'>O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most</span><br/>
<span id='466'>monstrous watch is at the door.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech171'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='467'>Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to</span><br/>
<span id='468'>say in the behalf of that Falstaff.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter the Hostess</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech172'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>

<span id='469'>O Jesu, my lord, my lord!</span><br/>

<span id='speech173'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>

<span id='470'>Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick:</span><br/>
<span id='471'>what's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech174'><strong>Hostess</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='472'>The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they</span><br/>
<span id='473'>are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech175'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='474'>Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of</span><br/>
<span id='475'>gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,</span><br/>
<span id='476'>without seeming so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech176'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='477'>And thou a natural coward, without instinct.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech177'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='478'>I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,</span><br/>
<span id='479'>so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart</span><br/>
<span id='480'>as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!</span><br/>
<span id='481'>I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.</span><br/>

<span id='speech178'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>

<span id='482'>Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up</span><br/>

<span id='speech179'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='485'>Both which I have had: but their date is out, and</span><br/>
<span id='486'>therefore I'll hide me.</span><br/>

<span id='speech180'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>

<span id='487'>Call in the sheriff.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all except PRINCE HENRY and PETO</em></p>

<span id='488'>Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech181'><strong>Sheriff</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='489'>First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry</span><br/>
<span id='490'>Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.</span><br/>

<span id='speech182'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='491'>What men?</span><br/>

<span id='speech183'><strong>Sheriff</strong></a>

<span id='speech185'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>

<span id='495'>The man, I do assure you, is not here;</span><br/>

<span id='498'>That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,</span><br/>
<span id='499'>Send him to answer thee, or any man,</span><br/>
<span id='500'>For any thing he shall be charged withal:</span><br/>
<span id='501'>And so let me entreat you leave the house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech186'><strong>Sheriff</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='502'>I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen</span><br/>
<span id='503'>Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.</span><br/>

<span id='speech187'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>

<span id='504'>It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,</span><br/>
<span id='505'>He shall be answerable; and so farewell.</span><br/>

<span id='speech188'><strong>Sheriff</strong></a>

<span id='506'>Good night, my noble lord.</span><br/>

<span id='speech191'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>

<span id='509'>This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,</span><br/>

<span id='speech192'><strong>PETO</strong></a>

<span id='511'>Falstaff!&mdash;Fast asleep behind the arras, and</span><br/>
<span id='512'>snorting like a horse.</span><br/>

<span id='513'>Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.</span><br/>
<p><em>He searcheth his pockets, and findeth certain papers</em></p>
<span id='514'>What hast thou found?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech194'><strong>PETO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='515'>Nothing but papers, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech195'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>

<span id='516'>Let's see what they be: read them.</span><br/>

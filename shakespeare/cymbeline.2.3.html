<h1>Cymbeline</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene III</h3>
<h4>An ante-chamber adjoining Imogen's apartments.</h4>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter CLOTEN and Lords</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the</span><br/>
<span id='2'>most coldest that ever turned up ace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>It would make any man cold to lose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>But not every man patient after the noble temper of</span><br/>
<span id='5'>your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Winning will put any man into courage. If I could</span><br/>
<span id='7'>get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>It's almost morning, is't not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Day, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>I would this music would come: I am advised to give</span><br/>
<span id='11'>her music o' mornings; they say it will penetrate.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Musicians</em></p>
<span id='12'>Come on; tune: if you can penetrate her with your</span><br/>
<span id='13'>fingering, so; we'll try with tongue too: if none</span><br/>
<span id='14'>will do, let her remain; but I'll never give o'er.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>First, a very excellent good-conceited thing;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich</span><br/>
<span id='17'>words to it: and then let her consider.</span><br/>
<p><em>SONG</em></p>
<span id='18'>Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And Phoebus 'gins arise,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>His steeds to water at those springs</span><br/>
<span id='21'>On chaliced flowers that lies;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And winking Mary-buds begin</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To ope their golden eyes:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>With every thing that pretty is,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>My lady sweet, arise:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Arise, arise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will</span><br/>
<span id='28'>consider your music the better: if it do not, it is</span><br/>
<span id='29'>a vice in her ears, which horse-hairs and</span><br/>
<span id='30'>calves'-guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to</span><br/>
<span id='31'>boot, can never amend.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Musicians</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Here comes the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>I am glad I was up so late; for that's the reason I</span><br/>
<span id='34'>was up so early: he cannot choose but take this</span><br/>
<span id='35'>service I have done fatherly.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN</em></p>
<span id='36'>Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Will she not forth?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>I have assailed her with music, but she vouchsafes no notice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>The exile of her minion is too new;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>She hath not yet forgot him: some more time</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Must wear the print of his remembrance out,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And then she's yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>You are most bound to the king,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Who lets go by no vantages that may</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself</span><br/>
<span id='47'>To orderly soliciting, and be friended</span><br/>
<span id='48'>With aptness of the season; make denials</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Increase your services; so seem as if</span><br/>
<span id='50'>You were inspired to do those duties which</span><br/>
<span id='51'>You tender to her; that you in all obey her,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Save when command to your dismission tends,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And therein you are senseless.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Senseless! not so.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>The one is Caius Lucius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>A worthy fellow,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>But that's no fault of his: we must receive him</span><br/>
<span id='60'>According to the honour of his sender;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>We must extend our notice. Our dear son,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>When you have given good morning to your mistress,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Attend the queen and us; we shall have need</span><br/>
<span id='65'>To employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but CLOTEN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Let her lie still and dream.</span><br/>
<p><em>Knocks</em></p>
<span id='68'>By your leave, ho!</span><br/>
<span id='69'>I know her women are about her: what</span><br/>
<span id='70'>If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Which buys admittance; oft it doth; yea, and makes</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Their deer to the stand o' the stealer; and 'tis gold</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Can it not do and undo? I will make</span><br/>
<span id='77'>One of her women lawyer to me, for</span><br/>
<span id='78'>I yet not understand the case myself.</span><br/>
<p><em>Knocks</em></p>
<span id='79'>By your leave.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Lady</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Who's there that knocks?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>A gentleman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>No more?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>That's more</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Your lady's person: is she ready?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Ay,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>To keep her chamber.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>There is gold for you;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Sell me your good report.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>How! my good name? or to report of you</span><br/>
<span id='93'>What I shall think is good?&mdash;The princess!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter IMOGEN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Lady</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains</span><br/>
<span id='96'>For purchasing but trouble; the thanks I give</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Is telling you that I am poor of thanks</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And scarce can spare them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Still, I swear I love you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>If you swear still, your recompense is still</span><br/>
<span id='102'>That I regard it not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>This is no answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>But that you shall not say I yield being silent,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>I would not speak. I pray you, spare me: 'faith,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>I shall unfold equal discourtesy</span><br/>
<span id='107'>To your best kindness: one of your great knowing</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Should learn, being taught, forbearance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>I will not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>          Fools are not mad folks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Do you call me fool?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>As I am mad, I do:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>You put me to forget a lady's manners,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>By the very truth of it, I care not for you,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>And am so near the lack of charity&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>To accuse myself&mdash;I hate you; which I had rather</span><br/>
<span id='122'>You felt than make't my boast.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>You sin against</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Obedience, which you owe your father. For</span><br/>
<span id='125'>The contract you pretend with that base wretch,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none:</span><br/>
<span id='128'>And though it be allow'd in meaner parties&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Yet who than he more mean?&mdash;to knit their souls,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>On whom there is no more dependency</span><br/>
<span id='131'>But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by</span><br/>
<span id='133'>The consequence o' the crown, and must not soil</span><br/>
<span id='134'>The precious note of it with a base slave.</span><br/>
<span id='135'>A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>A pantler, not so eminent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Profane fellow</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more</span><br/>
<span id='139'>But what thou art besides, thou wert too base</span><br/>
<span id='140'>To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Comparative for your virtues, to be styled</span><br/>
<span id='143'>The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated</span><br/>
<span id='144'>For being preferred so well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>The south-fog rot him!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>He never can meet more mischance than come</span><br/>
<span id='147'>To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer</span><br/>
<span id='149'>In my respect than all the hairs above thee,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PISANIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>'His garment!' Now the devil&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>'His garment!'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>                  I am sprited with a fool.</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Search for a jewel that too casually</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>If I would lose it for a revenue</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Of any king's in Europe. I do think</span><br/>
<span id='160'>I saw't this morning: confident I am</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:</span><br/>
<span id='162'>I hope it be not gone to tell my lord</span><br/>
<span id='163'>That I kiss aught but he.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>'Twill not be lost.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>I hope so: go and search.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit PISANIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>You have abused me:</span><br/>
<span id='167'>'His meanest garment!'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Ay, I said so, sir:</span><br/>
<span id='169'>If you will make't an action, call witness to't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>I will inform your father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Your mother too:</span><br/>
<span id='172'>She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>To the worst of discontent.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='230'>I'll be revenged:</span><br/>
<span id='231'>'His meanest garment!' Well.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<h1>The Merchant of Venice</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Belmont. A room in Portia's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and BALTHASAR</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Madam, although I speak it in your presence,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>You have a noble and a true conceit</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly</span><br/>
<span id='4'>In bearing thus the absence of your lord.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>But if you  knew to whom you show this honour,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>How true a gentleman you send relief,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>How dear a lover of my lord your husband,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>I know you would be prouder of the work</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Than customary bounty can enforce you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>I never did repent for doing good,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Nor shall not now: for in companions</span><br/>
<span id='12'>That do converse and waste the time together,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>There must be needs a like proportion</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Which makes me think that this Antonio,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Being the bosom lover of my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>How little is the cost I have bestow'd</span><br/>
<span id='20'>In purchasing the semblance of my soul</span><br/>
<span id='21'>From out the state of hellish misery!</span><br/>
<span id='22'>This comes too near the praising of myself;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Therefore no more of it: hear other things.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Lorenzo, I commit into your hands</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The husbandry and manage of my house</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Until my lord's return: for mine own part,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow</span><br/>
<span id='28'>To live in prayer and contemplation,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Only attended by Nerissa here,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Until her husband and my lord's return:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>There is a monastery two miles off;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And there will we abide. I do desire you</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Not to deny this imposition;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>The which my love and some necessity</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Now lays upon you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>                  Madam, with all my heart;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>I shall obey you in all fair commands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>My people do already know my mind,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And will acknowledge you and Jessica</span><br/>
<span id='40'>In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And so farewell, till we shall meet again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LORENZO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>JESSICA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>I wish your ladyship all heart's content.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased</span><br/>
<span id='45'>To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO</em></p>
<span id='46'>Now, Balthasar,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>As I have ever found thee honest-true,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And use thou all the endeavour of a man</span><br/>
<span id='50'>In speed to Padua: see thou render this</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Unto the tranect, to the common ferry</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BALTHASAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Madam, I go with all convenient speed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand</span><br/>
<span id='59'>That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Before they think of us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>NERISSA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Shall they see us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>That they shall think we are accomplished</span><br/>
<span id='64'>With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>When we are both accoutred like young men,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And wear my dagger with the braver grace,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And speak between the change of man and boy</span><br/>
<span id='69'>With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Into a manly stride, and speak of frays</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>How honourable ladies sought my love,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Which I denying, they fell sick and died;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>I could not do withal; then I'll repent,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>That men shall swear I have discontinued school</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind</span><br/>
<span id='79'>A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Which I will practise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>NERISSA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Why, shall we turn to men?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Fie, what a question's that,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!</span><br/>
<span id='84'>But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device</span><br/>
<span id='85'>When I am in my coach, which stays for us</span><br/>
<span id='86'>At the park gate; and therefore haste away,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>For we must measure twenty miles to-day.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

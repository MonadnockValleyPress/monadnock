<h1>Othello</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The garden of the castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do</span><br/>
<span id='2'>All my abilities in thy behalf.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>As if the case were his.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>But I will have my lord and you again</span><br/>
<span id='7'>As friendly as you were.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Bounteous madam,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>He's never any thing but your true servant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>You have known him long; and be you well assured</span><br/>
<span id='13'>He shall in strangeness stand no further off</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Than in a polite distance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Ay, but, lady,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>That policy may either last so long,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Or breed itself so out of circumstance,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>That, I being absent and my place supplied,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>My general will forget my love and service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Do not doubt that; before Emilia here</span><br/>
<span id='22'>I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it</span><br/>
<span id='24'>To the last article: my lord shall never rest;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>I'll intermingle every thing he does</span><br/>
<span id='28'>With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>For thy solicitor shall rather die</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Than give thy cause away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Madam, here comes my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Madam, I'll take my leave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Why, stay, and hear me speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Unfit for mine own purposes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Well, do your discretion.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit CASSIO</em></p>
<p><em>Enter OTHELLO and IAGO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Ha! I like not that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>What dost thou say?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Nothing, my lord: or if&mdash;I know not what.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>That he would steal away so guilty-like,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Seeing you coming.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>                  I do believe 'twas he.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>How now, my lord!</span><br/>
<span id='46'>I have been talking with a suitor here,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>A man that languishes in your displeasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Who is't you mean?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>If I have any grace or power to move you,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>His present reconciliation take;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>For if he be not one that truly loves you,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>I have no judgment in an honest face:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>I prithee, call him back.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Went he hence now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Ay, sooth; so humbled</span><br/>
<span id='58'>That he hath left part of his grief with me,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>But shall't be shortly?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>The sooner, sweet, for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Shall't be to-night at supper?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>No, not to-night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>To-morrow dinner, then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>I shall not dine at home;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>I meet the captains at the citadel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>I prithee, name the time, but let it not</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And yet his trespass, in our common reason&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Save that, they say, the wars must make examples</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Out of their best&mdash;is not almost a fault</span><br/>
<span id='75'>To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>What you would ask me, that I should deny,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do</span><br/>
<span id='82'>To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>I will deny thee nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Why, this is not a boon;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit</span><br/>
<span id='89'>To your own person: nay, when I have a suit</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>It shall be full of poise and difficult weight</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And fearful to be granted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>I will deny thee nothing:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>To leave me but a little to myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Whate'er you be, I am obedient.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Chaos is come again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>My noble lord&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>                  What dost thou say, Iago?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Know of your love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>But for a satisfaction of my thought;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>No further harm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>                  Why of thy thought, Iago?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>I did not think he had been acquainted with her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>O, yes; and went between us very oft.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Indeed!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Is he not honest?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Honest, my lord!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>                  Honest! ay, honest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>My lord, for aught I know.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>What dost thou think?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Think, my lord!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Think, my lord!</span><br/>
<span id='122'>By heaven, he echoes me,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>As if there were some monster in his thought</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?</span><br/>
<span id='127'>And when I told thee he was of my counsel</span><br/>
<span id='128'>In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And didst contract and purse thy brow together,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Show me thy thought.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>My lord, you know I love you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>I think thou dost;</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>For such things in a false disloyal knave</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just</span><br/>
<span id='140'>They are close delations, working from the heart</span><br/>
<span id='141'>That passion cannot rule.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>For Michael Cassio,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>I think so too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>                  Men should be what they seem;</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Or those that be not, would they might seem none!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Certain, men should be what they seem.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Nay, yet there's more in this:</span><br/>
<span id='150'>I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='152'>The worst of words.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Good my lord, pardon me:</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Though I am bound to every act of duty,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>As where's that palace whereinto foul things</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>But some uncleanly apprehensions</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Keep leets and law-days and in session sit</span><br/>
<span id='161'>With meditations lawful?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear</span><br/>
<span id='164'>A stranger to thy thoughts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>I do beseech you&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>As, I confess, it is my nature's plague</span><br/>
<span id='168'>To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Shapes faults that are not&mdash;that your wisdom yet,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>From one that so imperfectly conceits,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Out of his scattering and unsure observance.</span><br/>
<span id='173'>It were not for your quiet nor your good,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>To let you know my thoughts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>What dost thou mean?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Is the immediate jewel of their souls:</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;</span><br/>
<span id='180'>'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:</span><br/>
<span id='181'>But he that filches from me my good name</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Robs me of that which not enriches him</span><br/>
<span id='183'>And makes me poor indeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Ha!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;</span><br/>
<span id='189'>It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock</span><br/>
<span id='190'>The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;</span><br/>
<span id='192'>But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>O misery!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>Poor and content is rich and rich enough,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>But riches fineless is as poor as winter</span><br/>
<span id='197'>To him that ever fears he shall be poor.</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend</span><br/>
<span id='199'>From jealousy!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>                  Why, why is this?</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>To follow still the changes of the moon</span><br/>
<span id='203'>With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>When I shall turn the business of my soul</span><br/>
<span id='206'>To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous</span><br/>
<span id='208'>To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw</span><br/>
<span id='212'>The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;</span><br/>
<span id='213'>For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;</span><br/>
<span id='214'>I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;</span><br/>
<span id='215'>And on the proof, there is no more but this,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='216'>Away at once with love or jealousy!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason</span><br/>
<span id='218'>To show the love and duty that I bear you</span><br/>
<span id='219'>With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,</span><br/>
<span id='220'>Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.</span><br/>
<span id='221'>Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;</span><br/>
<span id='222'>Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:</span><br/>
<span id='223'>I would not have your free and noble nature,</span><br/>
<span id='224'>Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:</span><br/>
<span id='225'>I know our country disposition well;</span><br/>
<span id='226'>In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks</span><br/>
<span id='227'>They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='229'>Dost thou say so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='230'>She did deceive her father, marrying you;</span><br/>
<span id='231'>And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,</span><br/>
<span id='232'>She loved them most.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='233'>And so she did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='234'>Why, go to then;</span><br/>
<span id='235'>She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,</span><br/>
<span id='236'>To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-</span><br/>
<span id='237'>He thought 'twas witchcraft&mdash;but I am much to blame;</span><br/>
<span id='238'>I humbly do beseech you of your pardon</span><br/>
<span id='239'>For too much loving you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='240'>I am bound to thee for ever.</span><br/>

<span id='speech81'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='241'>I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='242'>Not a jot, not a jot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='243'>I' faith, I fear it has.</span><br/>
<span id='244'>I hope you will consider what is spoke</span><br/>
<span id='245'>Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:</span><br/>
<span id='246'>I am to pray you not to strain my speech</span><br/>
<span id='247'>To grosser issues nor to larger reach</span><br/>
<span id='248'>Than to suspicion.</span><br/>

<span id='504'>Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,</span><br/>
<span id='505'>Whose icy current and compulsive course</span><br/>
<span id='506'>Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on</span><br/>
<span id='507'>To the Propontic and the Hellespont,</span><br/>
<span id='508'>Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,</span><br/>
<span id='509'>Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,</span><br/>
<span id='510'>Till that a capable and wide revenge</span><br/>
<span id='511'>Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,</span><br/>
<p><em>Kneels</em></p>
<span id='512'>In the due reverence of a sacred vow</span><br/>
<span id='513'>I here engage my words.</span><br/>

<span id='speech159'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='514'>Do not rise yet.</span><br/>
<p><em>Kneels</em></p>
<span id='515'>Witness, you ever-burning lights above,</span><br/>
<span id='516'>You elements that clip us round about,</span><br/>
<span id='517'>Witness that here Iago doth give up</span><br/>
<span id='518'>The execution of his wit, hands, heart,</span><br/>
<span id='519'>To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,</span><br/>
<span id='520'>And to obey shall be in me remorse,</span><br/>
<span id='521'>What bloody business ever.</span><br/>
<p><em>They rise</em></p>

<span id='speech160'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='522'>I greet thy love,</span><br/>
<span id='523'>Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,</span><br/>
<span id='524'>And will upon the instant put thee to't:</span><br/>
<span id='525'>Within these three days let me hear thee say</span><br/>
<span id='526'>That Cassio's not alive.</span><br/>

<span id='529'>Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!</span><br/>
<span id='530'>Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,</span><br/>
<span id='531'>To furnish me with some swift means of death</span><br/>
<span id='532'>For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.</span><br/>

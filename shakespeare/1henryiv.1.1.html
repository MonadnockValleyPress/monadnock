<h3>Act I, Scene I</H3>
<h4>London. The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>So shaken as we are, so wan with care,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And breathe short-winded accents of new broils</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To be commenced in strands afar remote.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>No more the thirsty entrance of this soil</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>All of one nature, of one substance bred,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Did lately meet in the intestine shock</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And furious close of civil butchery</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>March all one way and be no more opposed</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross</span><br/>
<span id='21'>We are impressed and engaged to fight,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb</span><br/>
<span id='24'>To chase these pagans in those holy fields</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd</span><br/>
<span id='27'>For our advantage on the bitter cross.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>But this our purpose now is twelve month old,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>What yesternight our council did decree</span><br/>
<span id='33'>In forwarding this dear expedience.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>My liege, this haste was hot in question,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And many limits of the charge set down</span><br/>
<span id='36'>But yesternight: when all athwart there came</span><br/>
<span id='37'>A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Against the irregular and wild Glendower,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>A thousand of his people butchered;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Such beastly shameless transformation,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>By those Welshwomen done as may not be</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Without much shame retold or spoken of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>It seems then that the tidings of this broil</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Brake off our business for the Holy Land.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>For more uneven and unwelcome news</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Came from the north and thus it did import:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>That ever-valiant and approved Scot,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>At Holmedon met,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>As by discharge of their artillery,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And shape of likelihood, the news was told;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>For he that brought them, in the very heat</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And pride of their contention did take horse,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Uncertain of the issue any way.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Stain'd with the variation of each soil</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see</span><br/>
<span id='70'>On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son</span><br/>
<span id='72'>To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And is not this an honourable spoil?</span><br/>
<span id='75'>A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>In faith,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin</span><br/>
<span id='79'>In envy that my Lord Northumberland</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Should be the father to so blest a son,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>See riot and dishonour stain the brow</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved</span><br/>
<span id='87'>That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged</span><br/>
<span id='88'>In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Which he in this adventure hath surprised,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Malevolent to you in all aspects;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up</span><br/>
<span id='99'>The crest of youth against your dignity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>But I have sent for him to answer this;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And for this cause awhile we must neglect</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>But come yourself with speed to us again;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>For more is to be said and to be done</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Than out of anger can be uttered.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>I will, my liege.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

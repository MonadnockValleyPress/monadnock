<h1>Richard III</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene V</h3>
<h4>The Tower-walls.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, in rotten armour, marvellous ill-favoured</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And then begin again, and stop again,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Speak and look back, and pry on every side,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Are at my service, like enforced smiles;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And both are ready in their offices,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>At any time, to grace my stratagems.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>But what, is Catesby gone?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the Lord Mayor and CATESBY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Lord mayor,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Look to the drawbridge there!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Hark! a drum.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Catesby, o'erlook the walls.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Lord mayor, the reason we have sent&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>God and our innocency defend and guard us!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LOVEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>I took him for the plainest harmless creature</span><br/>
<span id='26'>That breathed upon this earth a Christian;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Made him my book wherein my soul recorded</span><br/>
<span id='28'>The history of all her secret thoughts:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>That, his apparent open guilt omitted,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>He lived from all attainder of suspect.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor</span><br/>
<span id='34'>That ever lived.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Would you imagine, or almost believe,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Were't not that, by great preservation,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor</span><br/>
<span id='38'>This day had plotted, in the council-house</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Lord Mayor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>What, had he so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>What, think You we are Turks or infidels?</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Or that we would, against the form of law,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>But that the extreme peril of the case,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>The peace of England and our persons' safety,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Enforced us to this execution?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Lord Mayor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>To warn false traitors from the like attempts.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>I never look'd for better at his hands,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Yet had not we determined he should die,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Until your lordship came to see his death;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Which now the loving haste of these our friends,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Because, my lord, we would have had you heard</span><br/>
<span id='57'>The traitor speak, and timorously confess</span><br/>
<span id='58'>The manner and the purpose of his treason;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>That you might well have signified the same</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Unto the citizens, who haply may</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Lord Mayor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>As well as I had seen and heard him speak</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And doubt you not, right noble princes both,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens</span><br/>
<span id='66'>With all your just proceedings in this cause.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>To avoid the carping censures of the world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>But since you come too late of our intents,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Yet witness what you hear we did intend:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Lord Mayor</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Only for saying he would make his son</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Moreover, urge his hateful luxury</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And bestial appetite in change of lust;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Without control, listed to make his prey.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Tell them, when that my mother went with child</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York</span><br/>
<span id='88'>My princely father then had wars in France</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And, by just computation of the time,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Found that the issue was not his begot;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Which well appeared in his lineaments,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Being nothing like the noble duke my father:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator</span><br/>
<span id='96'>As if the golden fee for which I plead</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Where you shall find me well accompanied</span><br/>
<span id='100'>With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>I go: and towards three or four o'clock</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit BUCKINGHAM</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;</span><br/>
<p><em>To CATESBY</em></p>
<span id='104'>Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER</em></p>
<span id='106'>Now will I in, to take some privy order,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And to give notice, that no manner of person</span><br/>
<span id='109'>At any time have recourse unto the princes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

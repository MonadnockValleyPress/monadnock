<h1>Henry VIII</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>A hall in Black-Friars.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Trumpets, sennet, and cornets. Enter two Vergers,  with short silver wands; next them, two Scribes, in  the habit of doctors; after them, CANTERBURY alone;  after him, LINCOLN, Ely, Rochester, and Saint  Asaph; next them, with some small distance, follows  a Gentleman bearing the purse, with the great seal,  and a cardinal's hat; then two Priests, bearing  each a silver cross; then a Gentleman-usher  bare-headed, accompanied with a Sergeant-at-arms  bearing a silver mace; then two Gentlemen bearing  two great silver pillars; after them, side by side,  CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS; two Noblemen  with the sword and mace. KING HENRY VIII takes  place under the cloth of state; CARDINAL WOLSEY and  CARDINAL CAMPEIUS sit under him as judges. QUEEN  KATHARINE takes place some distance from KING  HENRY VIII. The Bishops place themselves on each  side the court, in manner of a consistory; below  them, the Scribes. The Lords sit next the Bishops.  The rest of the Attendants stand in convenient order about the stage</em>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Sir, I desire you do me right and justice;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And to bestow your pity on me: for</span><br/>
<span id='15'>I am a most poor woman, and a stranger,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Born out of your dominions; having here</span><br/>
<span id='17'>No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>In what have I offended you? what cause</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Hath my behavior given to your displeasure,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>That thus you should proceed to put me off,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>I have been to you a true and humble wife,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>At all times to your will conformable;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry</span><br/>
<span id='27'>As I saw it inclined: when was the hour</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I ever contradicted your desire,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Have I not strove to love, although I knew</span><br/>
<span id='31'>He were mine enemy? what friend of mine</span><br/>
<span id='32'>That had to him derived your anger, did I</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Continue in my liking? nay, gave notice</span><br/>
<span id='34'>He was from thence discharged. Sir, call to mind</span><br/>
<span id='35'>That I have been your wife, in this obedience,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Upward of twenty years, and have been blest</span><br/>
<span id='37'>With many children by you: if, in the course</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And process of this time, you can report,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And prove it too, against mine honour aught,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Against your sacred person, in God's name,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Turn me away; and let the foul'st contempt</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Shut door upon me, and so give me up</span><br/>
<span id='44'>To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you sir,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>The king, your father, was reputed for</span><br/>
<span id='46'>A prince most prudent, of an excellent</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And unmatch'd wit and judgment: Ferdinand,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>My father, king of Spain, was reckon'd one</span><br/>
<span id='49'>The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many</span><br/>
<span id='50'>A year before: it is not to be question'd</span><br/>
<span id='51'>That they had gather'd a wise council to them</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Of every realm, that did debate this business,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Who deem'd our marriage lawful: wherefore I humbly</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Be by my friends in Spain advised; whose counsel</span><br/>
<span id='56'>I will implore: if not, i' the name of God,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Your pleasure be fulfill'd!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>You have here, lady,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And of your choice, these reverend fathers; men</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Of singular integrity and learning,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Yea, the elect o' the land, who are assembled</span><br/>
<span id='62'>To plead your cause: it shall be therefore bootless</span><br/>
<span id='63'>That longer you desire the court; as well</span><br/>
<span id='64'>For your own quiet, as to rectify</span><br/>
<span id='65'>What is unsettled in the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>His grace</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Hath spoken well and justly: therefore, madam,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>It's fit this royal session do proceed;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And that, without delay, their arguments</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Be now produced and heard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Lord cardinal,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>To you I speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>                  Your pleasure, madam?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Sir,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>I am about to weep; but, thinking that</span><br/>
<span id='76'>We are a queen, or long have dream'd so, certain</span><br/>
<span id='77'>The daughter of a king, my drops of tears</span><br/>
<span id='78'>I'll turn to sparks of fire.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Be patient yet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>I will, when you are humble; nay, before,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Or God will punish me. I do believe,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Induced by potent circumstances, that</span><br/>
<span id='83'>You are mine enemy, and make my challenge</span><br/>
<span id='84'>You shall not be my judge: for it is you</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>I hold my most malicious foe, and think not</span><br/>
<span id='90'>At all a friend to truth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>I do profess</span><br/>
<span id='92'>You speak not like yourself; who ever yet</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Have stood to charity, and display'd the effects</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Of disposition gentle, and of wisdom</span><br/>
<span id='95'>O'ertopping woman's power. Madam, you do me wrong:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>I have no spleen against you; nor injustice</span><br/>
<span id='97'>For you or any: how far I have proceeded,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Or how far further shall, is warranted</span><br/>
<span id='99'>By a commission from the consistory,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Yea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge me</span><br/>
<span id='101'>That I have blown this coal: I do deny it:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>The king is present: if it be known to him</span><br/>
<span id='103'>That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And worthily, my falsehood! yea, as much</span><br/>
<span id='105'>As you have done my truth. If he know</span><br/>
<span id='106'>That I am free of your report, he knows</span><br/>
<span id='107'>I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him</span><br/>
<span id='108'>It lies to cure me: and the cure is, to</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Remove these thoughts from you: the which before</span><br/>
<span id='110'>His highness shall speak in, I do beseech</span><br/>
<span id='111'>You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And to say so no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>My lord, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>I am a simple woman, much too weak</span><br/>
<span id='115'>To oppose your cunning. You're meek and</span><br/>
<span id='116'>humble-mouth'd;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>With meekness and humility; but your heart</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>You have, by fortune and his highness' favours,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Where powers are your retainers, and your words,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Domestics to you, serve your will as't please</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>You tender more your person's honour than</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Your high profession spiritual: that again</span><br/>
<span id='127'>I do refuse you for my judge; and here,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Before you all, appeal unto the pope,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And to be judged by him.</span><br/>
<p><em>She curtsies to KING HENRY VIII, and offers to depart</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>The queen is obstinate,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Disdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.</span><br/>
<span id='134'>She's going away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Call her again.</span><br/>

<span id='139'>When you are call'd, return. Now, the Lord help,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>They vex me past my patience! Pray you, pass on:</span><br/>
<span id='141'>I will not tarry; no, nor ever more</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Upon this business my appearance make</span><br/>
<span id='143'>In any of their courts.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt QUEEN KATHARINE and her Attendants</em></p>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>

<span id='144'>Go thy ways, Kate:</span><br/>
<span id='145'>That man i' the world who shall report he has</span><br/>
<span id='146'>A better wife, let him in nought be trusted,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>For speaking false in that: thou art, alone,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>If thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Obeying in commanding, and thy parts</span><br/>

<span id='152'>The queen of earthly queens: she's noble born;</span><br/>
<span id='153'>And, like her true nobility, she has</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Carried herself towards me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>Most gracious sir,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>In humblest manner I require your highness,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>That it shall please you to declare, in hearing</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Of all these ears,&mdash;for where I am robb'd and bound,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>There must I be unloosed, although not there</span><br/>
<span id='160'>At once and fully satisfied,&mdash;whether ever I</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Did broach this business to your highness; or</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Laid any scruple in your way, which might</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Induce you to the question on't? or ever</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Have to you, but with thanks to God for such</span><br/>
<span id='165'>A royal lady, spake one the least word that might</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Be to the prejudice of her present state,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Or touch of her good person?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>My lord cardinal,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>I free you from't. You are not to be taught</span><br/>
<span id='171'>That you have many enemies, that know not</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Why they are so, but, like to village-curs,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Bark when their fellows do: by some of these</span><br/>
<span id='174'>The queen is put in anger. You're excused:</span><br/>
<span id='175'>But will you be more justified? You ever</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired</span><br/>
<span id='177'>It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>The passages made toward it: on my honour,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>I will be bold with time and your attention:</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:</span><br/>
<span id='183'>My conscience first received a tenderness,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd</span><br/>
<span id='185'>By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Who had been hither sent on the debating</span><br/>
<span id='187'>A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Ere a determinate resolution, he,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>I mean the bishop, did require a respite;</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Wherein he might the king his lord advertise</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Whether our daughter were legitimate,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook</span><br/>
<span id='195'>The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble</span><br/>
<span id='197'>The region of my breast; which forced such way,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>That many mazed considerings did throng</span><br/>
<span id='199'>And press'd in with this caution. First, methought</span><br/>
<span id='200'>I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>If it conceived a male child by me, should</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Do no more offices of life to't than</span><br/>
<span id='204'>The grave does to the dead; for her male issue</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Or died where they were made, or shortly after</span><br/>
<span id='206'>This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that</span><br/>
<span id='210'>I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in</span><br/>
<span id='211'>By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in</span><br/>
<span id='213'>The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Toward this remedy, whereupon we are</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Now present here together: that's to say,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>I meant to rectify my conscience,&mdash;which</span><br/>
<span id='217'>I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='218'>By all the reverend fathers of the land</span><br/>
<span id='219'>And doctors learn'd: first I began in private</span><br/>
<span id='220'>With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember</span><br/>
<span id='221'>How under my oppression I did reek,</span><br/>
<span id='222'>When I first moved you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LINCOLN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='223'>Very well, my liege.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='224'>I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say</span><br/>
<span id='225'>How far you satisfied me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>LINCOLN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='226'>So please your highness,</span><br/>
<span id='227'>The question did at first so stagger me,</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Bearing a state of mighty moment in't</span><br/>
<span id='229'>And consequence of dread, that I committed</span><br/>
<span id='230'>The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt;</span><br/>
<span id='231'>And did entreat your highness to this course</span><br/>
<span id='232'>Which you are running here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='233'>I then moved you,</span><br/>
<span id='234'>My Lord of Canterbury; and got your leave</span><br/>
<span id='235'>To make this present summons: unsolicited</span><br/>
<span id='236'>I left no reverend person in this court;</span><br/>
<span id='237'>But by particular consent proceeded</span><br/>
<span id='238'>Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on:</span><br/>
<span id='239'>For no dislike i' the world against the person</span><br/>
<span id='240'>Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points</span><br/>
<span id='241'>Of my alleged reasons, drive this forward:</span><br/>
<span id='242'>Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life</span><br/>
<span id='243'>And kingly dignity, we are contented</span><br/>
<span id='244'>To wear our mortal state to come with her,</span><br/>
<span id='245'>Katharine our queen, before the primest creature</span><br/>
<span id='246'>That's paragon'd o' the world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='247'>So please your highness,</span><br/>
<span id='248'>The queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness</span><br/>
<span id='249'>That we adjourn this court till further day:</span><br/>
<span id='250'>Meanwhile must be an earnest motion</span><br/>
<span id='251'>Made to the queen, to call back her appeal</span><br/>
<span id='252'>She intends unto his holiness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='253'>[Aside]	I may perceive</span><br/>
<span id='254'>These cardinals trifle with me: I abhor</span><br/>
<span id='255'>This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.</span><br/>
<span id='256'>My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,</span><br/>
<span id='257'>Prithee, return: with thy approach, I know,</span><br/>

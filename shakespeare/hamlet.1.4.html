<h4>Scene IV. The platform.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>It is a nipping and an eager air.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>What hour now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>                  I think it lacks of twelve.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>No, it is struck.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.</span><br/>
<p><em>A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within</em></p>
<span id='8'>What does this mean, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The triumph of his pledge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Is it a custom?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Ay, marry, is't:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>But to my mind, though I am native here</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And to the manner born, it is a custom</span><br/>
<span id='18'>More honour'd in the breach than the observance.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>This heavy-headed revel east and west</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Soil our addition; and indeed it takes</span><br/>
<span id='23'>From our achievements, though perform'd at height,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>The pith and marrow of our attribute.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>So, oft it chances in particular men,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>That for some vicious mole of nature in them,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>As, in their birth&mdash;wherein they are not guilty,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Since nature cannot choose his origin&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens</span><br/>
<span id='32'>The form of plausive manners, that these men,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Their virtues else&mdash;be they as pure as grace,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>As infinite as man may undergo&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Shall in the general censure take corruption</span><br/>
<span id='38'>From that particular fault: the dram of eale</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Doth all the noble substance of a doubt</span><br/>
<span id='40'>To his own scandal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Look, my lord, it comes!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Ghost</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Angels and ministers of grace defend us!</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Be thy intents wicked or charitable,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Thou comest in such a questionable shape</span><br/>
<span id='47'>That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>To cast thee up again. What may this mean,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Making night hideous; and we fools of nature</span><br/>
<span id='58'>So horridly to shake our disposition</span><br/>
<span id='59'>With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?</span><br/>
<p><em>Ghost beckons HAMLET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>It beckons you to go away with it,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>As if it some impartment did desire</span><br/>
<span id='63'>To you alone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>                  Look, with what courteous action</span><br/>
<span id='65'>It waves you to a more removed ground:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>But do not go with it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>No, by no means.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>It will not speak; then I will follow it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Do not, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>                  Why, what should be the fear?</span><br/>
<span id='71'>I do not set my life in a pin's fee;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And for my soul, what can it do to that,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Being a thing immortal as itself?</span><br/>
<span id='74'>It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff</span><br/>
<span id='77'>That beetles o'er his base into the sea,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And there assume some other horrible form,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And draw you into madness? think of it:</span><br/>
<span id='81'>The very place puts toys of desperation,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Without more motive, into every brain</span><br/>
<span id='83'>That looks so many fathoms to the sea</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And hears it roar beneath.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>It waves me still.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Go on; I'll follow thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>You shall not go, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Hold off your hands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Be ruled; you shall not go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>My fate cries out,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And makes each petty artery in this body</span><br/>
<span id='92'>As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!</span><br/>
<span id='95'>I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>He waxes desperate with imagination.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Have after. To what issue will this come?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Heaven will direct it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MARCELLUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Nay, let's follow him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Henry VI, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Other plains in Gascony.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter SOMERSET, with his army; a Captain of TALBOT's with him</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>It is too late; I cannot send them now:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>This expedition was by York and Talbot</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Too rashly plotted: all our general force</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Might with a sally of the very town</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Be buckled with: the over-daring Talbot</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour</span><br/>
<span id='7'>By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>York set him on to fight and die in shame,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Captain</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Here is Sir William Lucy, who with me</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Set from our o'ermatch'd forces forth for aid.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Sir William LUCY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>How now, Sir William! whither were you sent?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LUCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Whither, my lord? from bought and sold Lord Talbot;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Who, ring'd about with bold adversity,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Cries out for noble York and Somerset,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>To beat assailing death from his weak legions:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And whiles the honourable captain there</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And, in advantage lingering, looks for rescue,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>You, his false hopes, the trust of England's honour,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Let not your private discord keep away</span><br/>
<span id='23'>The levied succors that should lend him aid,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>While he, renowned noble gentleman,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Yields up his life unto a world of odds:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Orleans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Alencon, Reignier, compass him about,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And Talbot perisheth by your default.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>York set him on; York should have sent him aid.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LUCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>And York as fast upon your grace exclaims;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Swearing that you withhold his levied host,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Collected for this expedition.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>York lies; he might have sent and had the horse;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>I owe him little duty, and less love;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LUCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>The fraud of England, not the force of France,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Hath now entrapp'd the noble-minded Talbot:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Never to England shall he bear his life;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>But dies, betray'd to fortune by your strife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Come, go; I will dispatch the horsemen straight:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Within six hours they will be at his aid.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LUCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Too late comes rescue: he is ta'en or slain;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>For fly he could not, if he would have fled;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And fly would Talbot never, though he might.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>If he be dead, brave Talbot, then adieu!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LUCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>His fame lives in the world, his shame in you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

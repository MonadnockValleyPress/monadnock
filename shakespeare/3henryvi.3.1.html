<h1>Henry VI, Part 3</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>A forest in the north of England.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter two Keepers, with cross-bows in their hands</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Keeper</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>For through this laund anon the deer will come;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And in this covert will we make our stand,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Culling the principal of all the deer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Keeper</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Keeper</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And, for the time shall not seem tedious,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>I'll tell thee what befell me on a day</span><br/>
<span id='11'>In this self-place where now we mean to stand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Keeper</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter KING HENRY VI, disguised, with a prayerbook</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>No humble suitors press to speak for right,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>No, not a man comes for redress of thee;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>For how can I help them, and not myself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>First Keeper</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>For wise men say it is the wisest course.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Second Keeper</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>First Keeper</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>My queen and son are gone to France for aid;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister</span><br/>
<span id='31'>To wife for Edward: if this news be true,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>For Warwick is a subtle orator,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>By this account then Margaret may win him;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>For she's a woman to be pitied much:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And Nero will be tainted with remorse,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And in conclusion wins the king from her,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>With promise of his sister, and what else,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>To strengthen and support King Edward's place.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Second Keeper</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>More than I seem, and less than I was born to:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>A man at least, for less I should not be;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And men may talk of kings, and why not I?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Second Keeper</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Second Keeper</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>My crown is in my heart, not on my head;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Second Keeper</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Your crown content and you must be contented</span><br/>
<span id='68'>To go along with us; for as we think,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>You are the king King Edward hath deposed;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Will apprehend you as his enemy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>But did you never swear, and break an oath?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Second Keeper</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>No, never such an oath; nor will not now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Where did you dwell when I was King of England?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Second Keeper</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Here in this country, where we now remain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>I was anointed king at nine months old;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>My father and my grandfather were kings,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And you were sworn true subjects unto me:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>First Keeper</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>No;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>For we were subjects but while you were king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Look, as I blow this feather from my face,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And as the air blows it to me again,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Obeying with my wind when I do blow,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And yielding to another when it blows,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Commanded always by the greater gust;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Such is the lightness of you common men.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>But do not break your oaths; for of that sin</span><br/>
<span id='91'>My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>First Keeper</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>So would you be again to Henry,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>If he were seated as King Edward is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>First Keeper</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>To go with us unto the officers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And what God will, that let your king perform;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And what he will, I humbly yield unto.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

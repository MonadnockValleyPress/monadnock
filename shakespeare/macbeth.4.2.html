<blockquote>
<em>Enter LADY MACDUFF, her Son, and ROSS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>What had he done, to make him fly the land?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>You must have patience, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>He had none:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>His flight was madness: when our actions do not,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Our fears do make us traitors.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>You know not</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>His mansion and his titles in a place</span><br/>
<span id='10'>From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The most diminutive of birds, will fight,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>All is the fear and nothing is the love;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>As little is the wisdom, where the flight</span><br/>
<span id='16'>So runs against all reason.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>My dearest coz,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows</span><br/>
<span id='20'>The fits o' the season. I dare not speak</span><br/>
<span id='21'>much further;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>But cruel are the times, when we are traitors</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour</span><br/>
<span id='24'>From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>But float upon a wild and violent sea</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Each way and move. I take my leave of you:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Shall not be long but I'll be here again:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward</span><br/>
<span id='29'>To what they were before. My pretty cousin,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Blessing upon you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>I take my leave at once.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Sirrah, your father's dead;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And what will you do now? How will you live?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>As birds do, mother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>What, with worms and flies?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>With what I get, I mean; and so do they.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>The pitfall nor the gin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>My father is not dead, for all your saying.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Nay, how will you do for a husband?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>With wit enough for thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Was my father a traitor, mother?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Ay, that he was.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>What is a traitor?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Why, one that swears and lies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>And be all traitors that do so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Every one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Who must hang them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Why,  the honest men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Then the liars and swearers are fools,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>for there are liars and swearers enow to beat</span><br/>
<span id='62'>the honest men and hang up them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Now, God help thee, poor monkey!</span><br/>
<span id='64'>But how wilt thou do for a father?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>If he were dead, you'ld weep for</span><br/>
<span id='66'>him: if you would not, it were a good sign</span><br/>
<span id='67'>that I should quickly have a new father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Though in your state of honour I am perfect.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>If you will take a homely man's advice,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>To do worse to you were fell cruelty,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!</span><br/>
<span id='77'>I dare abide no longer.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Whither should I fly?</span><br/>
<span id='79'>I have done no harm. But I remember now</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I am in this earthly world; where to do harm</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Is often laudable, to do good sometime</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Do I put up that womanly defence,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To say I have done no harm?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Murderers</em></p>
<span id='85'>What are these faces?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Where is your husband?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LADY MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>I hope, in no place so unsanctified</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Where such as thou mayst find him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>He's a traitor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>What, you egg!</span><br/>
<p><em>Stabbing him</em></p>
<span id='92'>Young fry of treachery!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>He has kill'd me, mother:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Run away, I pray you!</span><br/>
<p><em>Dies</em></p>
<p><em>Exit LADY MACDUFF, crying 'Murder!' Exeunt Murderers, following her</em></p>

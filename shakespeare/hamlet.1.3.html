<h4>Scene III. A room in Polonius' house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And, sister, as the winds give benefit</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>But let me hear from you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Do you doubt that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>A violet in the youth of primy nature,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>       No more but so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Think it no more;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>For nature, crescent, does not grow alone</span><br/>
<span id='14'>In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>The inward service of the mind and soul</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</span><br/>
<span id='18'>The virtue of his will: but you must fear,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>For he himself is subject to his birth:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>He may not, as unvalued persons do,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Carve for himself; for on his choice depends</span><br/>
<span id='23'>The safety and health of this whole state;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And therefore must his choice be circumscribed</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Unto the voice and yielding of that body</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</span><br/>
<span id='28'>As he in his particular act and place</span><br/>
<span id='29'>May give his saying deed; which is no further</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>If with too credent ear you list his songs,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open</span><br/>
<span id='34'>To his unmaster'd importunity.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And keep you in the rear of your affection,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Out of the shot and danger of desire.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>The chariest maid is prodigal enough,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>If she unmask her beauty to the moon:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>The canker galls the infants of the spring,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And in the morn and liquid dew of youth</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Contagious blastments are most imminent.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And recks not his own rede.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>O, fear me not.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>I stay too long: but here my father comes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter POLONIUS</em></p>
<span id='56'>A double blessing is a double grace,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Occasion smiles upon a second leave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!</span><br/>
<span id='59'>The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And these few precepts in thy memory</span><br/>
<span id='62'>See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Nor any unproportioned thought his act.</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>But do not dull thy palm with entertainment</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>For the apparel oft proclaims the man,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And they in France of the best rank and station</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Are of a most select and generous chief in that.</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Neither a borrower nor a lender be;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>For loan oft loses both itself and friend,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>This above all: to thine ownself be true,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And it must follow, as the night the day,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Thou canst not then be false to any man.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>The time invites you; go; your servants tend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well</span><br/>
<span id='88'>What I have said to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>'Tis in my memory lock'd,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And you yourself shall keep the key of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Marry, well bethought:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Given private time to you; and you yourself</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And that in way of caution, I must tell you,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>You do not understand yourself so clearly</span><br/>
<span id='101'>As it behoves my daughter and your honour.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>What is between you? give me up the truth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Of his affection to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>I do not know, my lord, what I should think.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;</span><br/>
<span id='110'>That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Or&mdash;not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Running it thus&mdash;you'll tender me a fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>My lord, he hath importuned me with love</span><br/>
<span id='115'>In honourable fashion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>With almost all the holy vows of heaven.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Even in their promise, as it is a-making,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>You must not take for fire. From this time</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Set your entreatments at a higher rate</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Believe so much in him, that he is young</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And with a larger tether may he walk</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Not of that dye which their investments show,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>But mere implorators of unholy suits,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>The better to beguile. This is for all:</span><br/>
<span id='136'>I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Have you so slander any moment leisure,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>I shall obey, my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Winter's Tale</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>A court of Justice.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LEONTES, Lords, and Officers</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried</span><br/>
<span id='3'>The daughter of a king, our wife, and one</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Of being tyrannous, since we so openly</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Even to the guilt or the purgation.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Produce the prisoner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>It is his highness' pleasure that the queen</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Appear in person here in court. Silence!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HERMIONE guarded; PAULINA and Ladies attending</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Read the indictment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>[Reads]            Hermione, queen to the worthy</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Leontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and</span><br/>
<span id='14'>arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery</span><br/>
<span id='15'>with Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring</span><br/>
<span id='16'>with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign</span><br/>
<span id='17'>lord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence</span><br/>
<span id='18'>whereof being by circumstances partly laid open,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance</span><br/>
<span id='20'>of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for</span><br/>
<span id='21'>their better safety, to fly away by night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Since what I am to say must be but that</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Which contradicts my accusation and</span><br/>
<span id='24'>The testimony on my part no other</span><br/>
<span id='25'>But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me</span><br/>
<span id='26'>To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Be so received. But thus: if powers divine</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Behold our human actions, as they do,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>I doubt not then but innocence shall make</span><br/>
<span id='31'>False accusation blush and tyranny</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Who least will seem to do so, my past life</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>As I am now unhappy; which is more</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Than history can pattern, though devised</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And play'd to take spectators. For behold me</span><br/>
<span id='38'>A fellow of the royal bed, which owe</span><br/>
<span id='39'>A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing</span><br/>
<span id='41'>To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it</span><br/>
<span id='43'>As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>'Tis a derivative from me to mine,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And only that I stand for. I appeal</span><br/>
<span id='46'>To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Came to your court, how I was in your grace,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>How merited to be so; since he came,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>With what encounter so uncurrent I</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond</span><br/>
<span id='51'>The bound of honour, or in act or will</span><br/>
<span id='52'>That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Cry fie upon my grave!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>I ne'er heard yet</span><br/>
<span id='56'>That any of these bolder vices wanted</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Less impudence to gainsay what they did</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Than to perform it first.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>That's true enough;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>You will not own it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>More than mistress of</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not</span><br/>
<span id='64'>At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>With whom I am accused, I do confess</span><br/>
<span id='66'>I loved him as in honour he required,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>With such a kind of love as might become</span><br/>
<span id='68'>A lady like me, with a love even such,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>So and no other, as yourself commanded:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Which not to have done I think had been in me</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Both disobedience and ingratitude</span><br/>
<span id='72'>To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely</span><br/>
<span id='74'>That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd</span><br/>
<span id='76'>For me to try how: all I know of it</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Is that Camillo was an honest man;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And why he left your court, the gods themselves,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>You knew of his departure, as you know</span><br/>
<span id='81'>What you have underta'en to do in's absence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Sir,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>You speak a language that I understand not:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>My life stands in the level of your dreams,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Which I'll lay down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Your actions are my dreams;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>You had a bastard by Polixenes,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Those of your fact are so&mdash;so past all truth:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>No father owning it,&mdash;which is, indeed,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>More criminal in thee than it,&mdash;so thou</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Look for no less than death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Sir, spare your threats:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>The bug which you would fright me with I seek.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>To me can life be no commodity:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>But know not how it went. My second joy</span><br/>
<span id='102'>And first-fruits of my body, from his presence</span><br/>
<span id='103'>I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Haled out to murder: myself on every post</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred</span><br/>
<span id='108'>The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs</span><br/>
<span id='109'>To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Here to this place, i' the open air, before</span><br/>
<span id='111'>I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Tell me what blessings I have here alive,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else</span><br/>
<span id='118'>But what your jealousies awake, I tell you</span><br/>
<span id='119'>'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>I do refer me to the oracle:</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Apollo be my judge!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>This your request</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And in Apollo's name, his oracle.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt certain Officers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>The Emperor of Russia was my father:</span><br/>
<span id='126'>O that he were alive, and here beholding</span><br/>
<span id='127'>His daughter's trial! that he did but see</span><br/>
<span id='128'>The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Of pity, not revenge!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Officers, with CLEOMENES and DION</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought</span><br/>
<span id='133'>The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>You have not dared to break the holy seal</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Nor read the secrets in't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CLEOMENES</strong></span>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DION</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>All this we swear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>

<span id='138'>Break up the seals and read.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>[Reads]	Hermione is chaste;</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes</span><br/>
<span id='141'>a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten;</span><br/>
<span id='142'>and the king shall live without an heir, if that</span><br/>
<span id='143'>which is lost be not found.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Officer</strong></span>

<span id='147'>Ay, my lord; even so</span><br/>
<span id='148'>As it is here set down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>

<span id='149'>There is no truth at all i' the oracle:</span><br/>

<span id='171'>New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;</span><br/>
<span id='173'>For, being transported by my jealousies</span><br/>
<span id='174'>To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Camillo for the minister to poison</span><br/>
<span id='176'>My friend Polixenes: which had been done,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>But that the good mind of Camillo tardied</span><br/>
<span id='178'>My swift command, though I with death and with</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Reward did threaten and encourage him,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane</span><br/>
<span id='181'>And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Which you knew great, and to the hazard</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Of all incertainties himself commended,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>No richer than his honour: how he glisters</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Thorough my rust! and how his pity</span><br/>

<span id='195'>Must I receive, whose every word deserves</span><br/>
<span id='196'>To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Together working with thy jealousies,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle</span><br/>
<span id='199'>For girls of nine, O, think what they have done</span><br/>
<span id='200'>And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.</span><br/>
<span id='202'>That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;</span><br/>
<span id='203'>That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant</span><br/>

<span id='205'>Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon</span><br/>
<span id='208'>The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter</span><br/>
<span id='209'>To be or none or little; though a devil</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:</span><br/>

<span id='212'>Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,</span><br/>

<span id='229'>Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,</span><br/>
<span id='230'>Upon a barren mountain and still winter</span><br/>

<span id='261'>The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there</span><br/>
<span id='262'>Shall be my recreation: so long as nature</span><br/>
<span id='263'>Will bear up with this exercise, so long</span><br/>
<span id='264'>I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me</span><br/>
<span id='265'>Unto these sorrows.</span><br/>

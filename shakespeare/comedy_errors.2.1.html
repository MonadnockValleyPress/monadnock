<h1>The Comedy of Errors</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>The house of Antipholus of Ephesus.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>That in such haste I sent to seek his master!</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Good sister, let us dine and never fret:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>A man is master of his liberty:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Time is their master, and, when they see time,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Why should their liberty than ours be more?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Because their business still lies out o' door.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>O, know he is the bridle of your will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>There's none but asses will be bridled so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>There's nothing situate under heaven's eye</span><br/>
<span id='17'>But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Are their males' subjects and at their controls:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Men, more divine, the masters of all these,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Indued with intellectual sense and souls,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Are masters to their females, and their lords:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Then let your will attend on their accords.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>This servitude makes you to keep unwed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>How if your husband start some other where?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Till he come home again, I would forbear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>They can be meek that have no other cause.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>But were we burdened with like weight of pain,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>As much or more would we ourselves complain:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>But, if thou live to see like right bereft,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Well, I will marry one day, but to try.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DROMIO of Ephesus</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Say, is your tardy master now at hand?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears</span><br/>
<span id='46'>can witness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his</span><br/>
<span id='52'>blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce</span><br/>
<span id='53'>understand them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he</span><br/>
<span id='55'>hath great care to please his wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Horn-mad, thou villain!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>I mean not cuckold-mad;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>But, sure, he is stark mad.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>When I desired him to come home to dinner,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'</span><br/>
<span id='66'>'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!</span><br/>
<span id='68'>I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Quoth who?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Quoth my master:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'</span><br/>
<span id='72'>So that my errand, due unto my tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Go back again, and be new beaten home?</span><br/>
<span id='77'>For God's sake, send some other messenger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>And he will bless that cross with other beating:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Between you I shall have a holy head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Am I so round with you as you with me,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>That like a football you do spurn me thus?</span><br/>
<span id='84'>You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>His company must do his minions grace,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Hath homely age the alluring beauty took</span><br/>
<span id='90'>From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?</span><br/>
<span id='92'>If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Do their gay vestments his affections bait?</span><br/>
<span id='95'>That's not my fault: he's master of my state:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>What ruins are in me that can be found,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Of my defeatures. My decayed fair</span><br/>
<span id='99'>A sunny look of his would soon repair</span><br/>
<span id='100'>But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Or else what lets it but he would be here?</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Sister, you know he promised me a chain;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Would that alone, alone he would detain,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!</span><br/>
<span id='109'>I see the jewel best enamelled</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>That others touch, and often touching will</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

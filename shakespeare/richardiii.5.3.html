<span id='speech5'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>We must both give and take, my gracious lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>But where to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Who hath descried the number of the foe?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Why, our battalion trebles that account:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Which they upon the adverse party want.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Let us survey the vantage of the field</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Call for some men of sound direction.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Let's want no discipline, make no delay,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
<p><em>Enter, on the other side of the field, RICHMOND,  Sir William Brandon, OXFORD, and others. Some of the Soldiers pitch RICHMOND's tent</em></p>

<span id='22'>Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Give me some ink and paper in my tent.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>I'll draw the form and model of our battle,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Limit each leader to his several charge,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And part in just proportion our small strength.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,</span><br/>

<span id='30'>The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And by the second hour in the morning</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Desire the earl to see me in my tent:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BLUNT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Unless I have mista'en his colours much,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Which well I am assured I have not done,</span><br/>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BLUNT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='57'>Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.</span><br/>

<span id='73'>Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KING RICHARD III</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>I have not that alacrity of spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?</span><br/>

<span id='92'>In brief,&mdash;for so the season bids us be,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Prepare thy battle early in the morning,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And put thy fortune to the arbitrement</span><br/>

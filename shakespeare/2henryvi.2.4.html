<h1>Henry VI, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GLOUCESTER and his Servingmen, in mourning cloaks</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And after summer evermore succeeds</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Barren winter, with his wrathful nipping cold:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>So cares and joys abound, as seasons fleet.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Sirs, what's o'clock?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Servants</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Ten, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Ten is the hour that was appointed me</span><br/>
<span id='8'>To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To tread them with her tender-feeling feet.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The abject people gazing on thy face,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>That erst did follow thy proud chariot-wheels</span><br/>
<span id='15'>When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>But, soft! I think she comes; and I'll prepare</span><br/>
<span id='17'>My tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the DUCHESS in a white sheet, and a taper  burning in her hand; with STANLEY, the Sheriff, and Officers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>So please your grace, we'll take her from the sheriff.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>No, stir not, for your lives; let her pass by.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!</span><br/>
<span id='22'>See how the giddy multitude do point,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee!</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Be patient, gentle Nell; forget this grief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!</span><br/>
<span id='29'>For whilst I think I am thy married wife</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And thou a prince, protector of this land,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Methinks I should not thus be led along,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Mail'd up in shame, with papers on my back,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And followed with a rabble that rejoice</span><br/>
<span id='34'>To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And when I start, the envious people laugh</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And bid me be advised how I tread.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?</span><br/>
<span id='41'>No; dark shall be my light and night my day;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Sometime I'll say, I am Duke Humphrey's wife,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And he a prince and ruler of the land:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was</span><br/>
<span id='46'>As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock</span><br/>
<span id='48'>To every idle rascal follower.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>But be thou mild and blush not at my shame,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>For Suffolk, he that can do all in all</span><br/>
<span id='53'>With her that hateth thee and hates us all,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And York and impious Beaufort, that false priest,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And, fly thou how thou canst, they'll tangle thee:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Ah, Nell, forbear! thou aimest all awry;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>I must offend before I be attainted;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And had I twenty times so many foes,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And each of them had twenty times their power,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>All these could not procure me any scathe,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>So long as I am loyal, true and crimeless.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Why, yet thy scandal were not wiped away</span><br/>
<span id='67'>But I in danger for the breach of law.</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>I pray thee, sort thy heart to patience;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>These few days' wonder will be quickly worn.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Herald</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Herald</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>I summon your grace to his majesty's parliament,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Holden at Bury the first of this next month.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before!</span><br/>
<span id='74'>This is close dealing. Well, I will be there.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Herald</em></p>
<span id='75'>My Nell, I take my leave: and, master sheriff,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Let not her penance exceed the king's commission.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Sheriff</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>An't please your grace, here my commission stays,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And Sir John Stanley is appointed now</span><br/>
<span id='79'>To take her with him to the Isle of Man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>STANLEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>So am I given in charge, may't please your grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Entreat her not the worse in that I pray</span><br/>
<span id='83'>You use her well: the world may laugh again;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And I may live to do you kindness if</span><br/>
<span id='85'>You do it her: and so, Sir John, farewell!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Witness my tears, I cannot stay to speak.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Servingmen</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Art thou gone too? all comfort go with thee!</span><br/>
<span id='89'>For none abides with me: my joy is death;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Death, at whose name I oft have been afear'd,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Because I wish'd this world's eternity.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Stanley, I prithee, go, and take me hence;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>I care not whither, for I beg no favour,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Only convey me where thou art commanded.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>STANLEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>There to be used according to your state.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And shall I then be used reproachfully?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>STANLEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Like to a duchess, and Duke Humphrey's lady;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>According to that state you shall be used.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Sheriff</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>It is my office; and, madam, pardon me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Ay, ay, farewell; thy office is discharged.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Come, Stanley, shall we go?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>STANLEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And go we to attire you for our journey.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>My shame will not be shifted with my sheet:</span><br/>
<span id='109'>No, it will hang upon my richest robes</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And show itself, attire me how I can.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Go, lead the way; I long to see my prison.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

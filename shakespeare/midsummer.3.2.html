<h1>A Midsummer Night's Dream</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Another part of the wood.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter OBERON</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I wonder if Titania be awaked;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Then, what it was that next came in her eye,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Which she must dote on in extremity.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PUCK</em></p>
<span id='4'>Here comes my messenger.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>How now, mad spirit!</span><br/>
<span id='6'>What night-rule now about this haunted grove?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>My mistress with a monster is in love.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Near to her close and consecrated bower,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Were met together to rehearse a play</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Who Pyramus presented, in their sport</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake</span><br/>
<span id='17'>When I did him at this advantage take,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>An ass's nole I fixed on his head:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Anon his Thisbe must be answered,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Rising and cawing at the gun's report,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>He murder cries and help from Athens calls.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears</span><br/>
<span id='29'>thus strong,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all</span><br/>
<span id='33'>things catch.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>I led them on in this distracted fear,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And left sweet Pyramus translated there:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>When in that moment, so it came to pass,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>This falls out better than I could devise.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes</span><br/>
<span id='40'>With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>I took him sleeping,&mdash;that is finish'd too,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And the Athenian woman by his side:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Stand close: this is the same Athenian.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>This is the woman, but not this the man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HERMIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And kill me too.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>The sun was not so true unto the day</span><br/>
<span id='54'>As he to me: would he have stolen away</span><br/>
<span id='55'>From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon</span><br/>
<span id='56'>This whole earth may be bored and that the moon</span><br/>
<span id='57'>May through the centre creep and so displease</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>So should the murder'd look, and so should I,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HERMIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>What's this to my Lysander? where is he?</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>HERMIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Henceforth be never number'd among men!</span><br/>
<span id='71'>O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?</span><br/>
<span id='75'>An adder did it; for with doubler tongue</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>You spend your passion on a misprised mood:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HERMIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>An if I could, what should I get therefore?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HERMIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>A privilege never to see me more.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And from thy hated presence part I so:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>See me no more, whether he be dead or no.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>There is no following her in this fierce vein:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Here therefore for a while I will remain.</span><br/>
<span id='87'>So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow</span><br/>
<span id='88'>For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Which now in some slight measure it will pay,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>If for his tender here I make some stay.</span><br/>
<p><em>Lies down and sleeps</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Of thy misprision must perforce ensue</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>A million fail, confounding oath on oath.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>About the wood go swifter than the wind,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And Helena of Athens look thou find:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>By some illusion see thou bring her here:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>I go, I go; look how I go,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>   Flower of this purple dye,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Hit with Cupid's archery,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Sink in apple of his eye.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>When his love he doth espy,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Let her shine as gloriously</span><br/>
<span id='110'>As the Venus of the sky.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>When thou wakest, if she be by,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Beg of her for remedy.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter PUCK</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>   Captain of our fairy band,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Helena is here at hand;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And the youth, mistook by me,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Pleading for a lover's fee.</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Shall we their fond pageant see?</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Lord, what fools these mortals be!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Stand aside: the noise they make</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Will cause Demetrius to awake.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Then will two at once woo one;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>That must needs be sport alone;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>And those things do best please me</span><br/>
<span id='124'>That befal preposterously.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LYSANDER and HELENA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Scorn and derision never come in tears:</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>In their nativity all truth appears.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>How can these things in me seem scorn to you,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HELENA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>You do advance your cunning more and more.</span><br/>
<span id='132'>When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!</span><br/>
<span id='133'>These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>I had no judgment when to her I swore.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>HELENA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>[Awaking]  O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!</span><br/>
<span id='141'>To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!</span><br/>
<span id='144'>That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow</span><br/>
<span id='146'>When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss</span><br/>
<span id='147'>This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>HELENA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent</span><br/>
<span id='149'>To set against me for your merriment:</span><br/>
<span id='150'>If you we re civil and knew courtesy,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>You would not do me thus much injury.</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Can you not hate me, as I know you do,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>But you must join in souls to mock me too?</span><br/>
<span id='154'>If you were men, as men you are in show,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>You would not use a gentle lady so;</span><br/>
<span id='156'>To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.</span><br/>
<span id='158'>You both are rivals, and love Hermia;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And now both rivals, to mock Helena:</span><br/>
<span id='160'>A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes</span><br/>
<span id='162'>With your derision! none of noble sort</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Would so offend a virgin, and extort</span><br/>
<span id='164'>A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>For you love Hermia; this you know I know:</span><br/>
<span id='167'>And here, with all good will, with all my heart,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>And yours of Helena to me bequeath,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Whom I do love and will do till my death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>HELENA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Never did mockers waste more idle breath.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:</span><br/>
<span id='173'>If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.</span><br/>
<span id='174'>My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>And now to Helen is it home return'd,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>There to remain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>                  Helen, it is not so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter HERMIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>HERMIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>The ear more quick of apprehension makes;</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>It pays the hearing double recompense.</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound</span><br/>
<span id='187'>But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HERMIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>What love could press Lysander from my side?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Fair Helena, who more engilds the night</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HERMIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>You speak not as you think: it cannot be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HELENA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>Lo, she is one of this confederacy!</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three</span><br/>
<span id='198'>To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Have you conspired, have you with these contrived</span><br/>
<span id='201'>To bait me with this foul derision?</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Is all the counsel that we two have shared,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>When we have chid the hasty-footed time</span><br/>
<span id='205'>For parting us,&mdash;O, is it all forgot?</span><br/>
<span id='206'>All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?</span><br/>
<span id='207'>We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Have with our needles created both one flower,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Both warbling of one song, both in one key,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Had been incorporate. So we grow together,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>But yet an union in partition;</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;</span><br/>
<span id='216'>So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;</span><br/>
<span id='217'>Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,</span><br/>
<span id='218'>Due but to one and crowned with one crest.</span><br/>
<span id='219'>And will you rent our ancient love asunder,</span><br/>
<span id='220'>To join with men in scorning your poor friend?</span><br/>
<span id='221'>It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:</span><br/>
<span id='222'>Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,</span><br/>
<span id='223'>Though I alone do feel the injury.</span><br/>

<span id='speech44'><strong>HERMIA</strong></a>

<span id='speech45'><strong>HELENA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='226'>Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,</span><br/>
<span id='227'>To follow me and praise my eyes and face?</span><br/>
<span id='228'>And made your other love, Demetrius,</span><br/>
<span id='229'>Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,</span><br/>
<span id='230'>To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this</span><br/>
<span id='232'>To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander</span><br/>
<span id='233'>Deny your love, so rich within his soul,</span><br/>
<span id='234'>And tender me, forsooth, affection,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>But by your setting on, by your consent?</span><br/>
<span id='236'>What thought I be not so in grace as you,</span><br/>
<span id='237'>So hung upon with love, so fortunate,</span><br/>
<span id='238'>But miserable most, to love unloved?</span><br/>
<span id='239'>This you should pity rather than despise.</span><br/>

<span id='244'>This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.</span><br/>
<span id='245'>If you have any pity, grace, or manners,</span><br/>
<span id='246'>You would not make me such an argument.</span><br/>

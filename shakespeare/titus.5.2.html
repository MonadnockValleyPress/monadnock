<h1>Titus Andronicus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Rome. Before Titus's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, and CHIRON, disguised</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>I will encounter with Andronicus,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And say I am Revenge, sent from below</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Knock at his study, where, they say, he keeps,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Tell him Revenge is come to join with him,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And work confusion on his enemies.</span><br/>
<p><em>They knock</em></p>
<p><em>Enter TITUS, above</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Who doth molest my contemplation?</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Is it your trick to make me ope the door,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>That so my sad decrees may fly away,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And all my study be to no effect?</span><br/>
<span id='13'>You are deceived: for what I mean to do</span><br/>
<span id='14'>See here in bloody lines I have set down;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And what is written shall be executed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Titus, I am come to talk with thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>No, not a word; how can I grace my talk,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Wanting a hand to give it action?</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>If thou didst know me, thou wouldest talk with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>I am not mad; I know thee well enough:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Witness these trenches made by grief and care,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Witness the tiring day and heavy night;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Witness all sorrow, that I know thee well</span><br/>
<span id='26'>For our proud empress, mighty Tamora:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Is not thy coming for my other hand?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>She is thy enemy, and I thy friend:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>I am Revenge: sent from the infernal kingdom,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Come down, and welcome me to this world's light;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Confer with me of murder and of death:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>No vast obscurity or misty vale,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Where bloody murder or detested rape</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Can couch for fear, but I will find them out;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>To be a torment to mine enemies?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>I am; therefore come down, and welcome me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Do me some service, ere I come to thee.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Now give me some surance that thou art Revenge,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot-wheels;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And then I'll come and be thy waggoner,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And whirl along with thee about the globe.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And find out murderers in their guilty caves:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And when thy car is loaden with their heads,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Trot, like a servile footman, all day long,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Even from Hyperion's rising in the east</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Until his very downfall in the sea:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And day by day I'll do this heavy task,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>These are my ministers, and come with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Are these thy ministers? what are they call'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Rapine and Murder; therefore called so,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are!</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And you, the empress! but we worldly men</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>I will embrace thee in it by and by.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit above</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>This closing with him fits his lunacy</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And, being credulous in this mad thought,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>I'll make him send for Lucius his son;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And, whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>I'll find some cunning practise out of hand,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Or, at the least, make them his enemies.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter TITUS below</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Welcome, dread Fury, to my woful house:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>How like the empress and her sons you are!</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Could not all hell afford you such a devil?</span><br/>
<span id='87'>For well I wot the empress never wags</span><br/>
<span id='88'>But in her company there is a Moor;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And, would you represent our queen aright,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>It were convenient you had such a devil:</span><br/>
<span id='91'>But welcome, as you are. What shall we do?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Show me a villain that hath done a rape,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And I am sent to be revenged on him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And I will be revenged on them all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Look round about the wicked streets of Rome;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap</span><br/>
<span id='102'>To find another that is like to thee,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Good Rapine, stab him; he's a ravisher.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Go thou with them; and in the emperor's court</span><br/>
<span id='105'>There is a queen, attended by a Moor;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>For up and down she doth resemble thee:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>I pray thee, do on them some violent death;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>They have been violent to me and mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>But would it please thee, good Andronicus,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And bid him come and banquet at thy house;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>I will bring in the empress and her sons,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>The emperor himself and all thy foes;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>And at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>What says Andronicus to this device?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MARCUS</em></p>
<span id='122'>Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Bid him repair to me, and bring with him</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Tell him the emperor and the empress too</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>This do thou for my love; and so let him,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>As he regards his aged father's life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>This will I do, and soon return again.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Now will I hence about thy business,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And take my ministers along with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me;</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Or else I'll call my brother back again,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>[Aside to her sons]  What say you, boys? will you</span><br/>
<span id='138'>bide with him,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor</span><br/>
<span id='140'>How I have govern'd our determined jest?</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>And tarry with him till I turn again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>[Aside]  I know them all, though they suppose me mad,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>And will o'erreach them in their own devices:</span><br/>
<span id='145'>A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes</span><br/>
<span id='148'>To lay a complot to betray thy foes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit TAMORA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Tut, I have work enough for you to do.</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PUBLIUS and others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>PUBLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>What is your will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Know you these two?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>PUBLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>The empress' sons, I take them, Chiron and Demetrius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceived;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>The one is Murder, Rape is the other's name;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>And therefore bind them, gentle Publius.</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them.</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>And now I find it; therefore bind them sure,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>And stop their mouths, if they begin to cry.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>PUBLIUS,  &amp;c. lay hold on CHIRON and DEMETRIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>PUBLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>And therefore do we what we are commanded.</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Is he sure bound? look that you bind them fast.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter TITUS, with LAVINIA; he bearing a knife, and she a basin</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>But let them hear what fearful words I utter.</span><br/>
<span id='170'>O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>This goodly summer with your winter mix'd.</span><br/>
<span id='173'>You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>My hand cut off and made a merry jest;</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forced.</span><br/>
<span id='179'>What would you say, if I should let you speak?</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.</span><br/>
<span id='182'>This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Whilst that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold</span><br/>
<span id='184'>The basin that receives your guilty blood.</span><br/>
<span id='185'>You know your mother means to feast with me,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad:</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust</span><br/>
<span id='188'>And with your blood and it I'll make a paste,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>And of the paste a coffin I will rear</span><br/>
<span id='190'>And make two pasties of your shameful heads,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>And bid that strumpet, your unhallow'd dam,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Like to the earth swallow her own increase.</span><br/>
<span id='193'>This is the feast that I have bid her to,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;</span><br/>
<span id='195'>For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>And worse than Progne I will be revenged:</span><br/>
<span id='197'>And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,</span><br/>
<p><em>He cuts their throats</em></p>
<span id='198'>Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Let me go grind their bones to powder small</span><br/>
<span id='200'>And with this hateful liquor temper it;</span><br/>
<span id='201'>And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Come, come, be every one officious</span><br/>
<span id='203'>To make this banquet; which I wish may prove</span><br/>
<span id='204'>More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.</span><br/>
<span id='205'>So, now bring them in, for I'll play the cook,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>And see them ready 'gainst their mother comes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt, bearing the dead bodies</em></p>

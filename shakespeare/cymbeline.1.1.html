<h1>Cymbeline</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter two Gentlemen</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods</span><br/>
<span id='2'>No more obey the heavens than our courtiers</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Still seem as does the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>But what's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom</span><br/>
<span id='6'>He purposed to his wife's sole son&mdash;a widow</span><br/>
<span id='7'>That late he married&mdash;hath referr'd herself</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Is outward sorrow; though I think the king</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Be touch'd at very heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>None but the king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>That most desired the match; but not a courtier,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Although they wear their faces to the bent</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Glad at the thing they scowl at.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>And why so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>I mean, that married her, alack, good man!</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And therefore banish'd&mdash;is a creature such</span><br/>
<span id='23'>As, to seek through the regions of the earth</span><br/>
<span id='24'>For one his like, there would be something failing</span><br/>
<span id='25'>In him that should compare. I do not think</span><br/>
<span id='26'>So fair an outward and such stuff within</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Endows a man but he.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>You speak him far.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>I do extend him, sir, within himself,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Crush him together rather than unfold</span><br/>
<span id='31'>His measure duly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>                  What's his name and birth?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>I cannot delve him to the root: his father</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Against the Romans with Cassibelan,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>But had his titles by Tenantius whom</span><br/>
<span id='37'>He served with glory and admired success,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And had, besides this gentleman in question,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Died with their swords in hand; for which</span><br/>
<span id='42'>their father,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow</span><br/>
<span id='44'>That he quit being, and his gentle lady,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased</span><br/>
<span id='46'>As he was born. The king he takes the babe</span><br/>
<span id='47'>To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Puts to him all the learnings that his time</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Could make him the receiver of; which he took,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Which rare it is to do&mdash;most praised, most loved,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>A sample to the youngest, to the more mature</span><br/>
<span id='55'>A glass that feated them, and to the graver</span><br/>
<span id='56'>A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>For whom he now is banish'd, her own price</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>By her election may be truly read</span><br/>
<span id='60'>What kind of man he is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>I honour him</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Is she sole child to the king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>His only child.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Which way they went.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>How long is this ago?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Some twenty years.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>That a king's children should be so convey'd,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>That could not trace them!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Howsoe'er 'tis strange,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Yet is it true, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>I do well believe you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>The queen, and princess.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
<p><em>Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGEN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>After the slander of most stepmothers,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys</span><br/>
<span id='85'>That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>So soon as I can win the offended king,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>I will be known your advocate: marry, yet</span><br/>
<span id='88'>The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good</span><br/>
<span id='89'>You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Your wisdom may inform you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Please your highness,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>I will from hence to-day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>You know the peril.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying</span><br/>
<span id='95'>The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Hath charged you should not speak together.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>O</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Always reserved my holy duty&mdash;what</span><br/>
<span id='102'>His rage can do on me: you must be gone;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And I shall here abide the hourly shot</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>But that there is this jewel in the world</span><br/>
<span id='106'>That I may see again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>My queen! my mistress!</span><br/>
<span id='108'>O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause</span><br/>
<span id='109'>To be suspected of more tenderness</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Than doth become a man. I will remain</span><br/>
<span id='111'>The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>My residence in Rome at one Philario's,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Who to my father was a friend, to me</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Though ink be made of gall.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter QUEEN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Be brief, I pray you:</span><br/>
<span id='118'>If the king come, I shall incur I know not</span><br/>
<span id='119'>How much of his displeasure.</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='120'>Yet I'll move him</span><br/>
<span id='121'>To walk this way: I never do him wrong,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Pays dear for my offences.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Should we be taking leave</span><br/>
<span id='125'>As long a term as yet we have to live,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Nay, stay a little:</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Were you but riding forth to air yourself,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>But keep it till you woo another wife,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>When Imogen is dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>How, how! another?</span><br/>
<span id='134'>You gentle gods, give me but this I have,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And sear up my embracements from a next</span><br/>
<span id='136'>With bonds of death!</span><br/>
<p><em>Putting on the ring</em></p>
<span id='137'>Remain, remain thou here</span><br/>
<span id='138'>While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>As I my poor self did exchange for you,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles</span><br/>
<span id='141'>I still win of you: for my sake wear this;</span><br/>
<span id='142'>It is a manacle of love; I'll place it</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Upon this fairest prisoner.</span><br/>
<p><em>Putting a bracelet upon her arm</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>O the gods!</span><br/>
<span id='145'>When shall we see again?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CYMBELINE and Lords</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Alack, the king!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!</span><br/>
<span id='148'>If after this command thou fraught the court</span><br/>
<span id='149'>With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Thou'rt poison to my blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>The gods protect you!</span><br/>
<span id='152'>And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>                  There cannot be a pinch in death</span><br/>
<span id='154'>More sharp than this is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>O disloyal thing,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st</span><br/>
<span id='157'>A year's age on me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>I beseech you, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Harm not yourself with your vexation</span><br/>
<span id='160'>I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Subdues all pangs, all fears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Past grace? obedience?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And did avoid a puttock.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne</span><br/>
<span id='168'>A seat for baseness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>No; I rather added</span><br/>
<span id='170'>A lustre to it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>                  O thou vile one!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Sir,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:</span><br/>
<span id='174'>You bred him as my playfellow, and he is</span><br/>
<span id='175'>A man worth any woman, overbuys me</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Almost the sum he pays.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>What, art thou mad?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were</span><br/>
<span id='179'>A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Our neighbour shepherd's son!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>Thou foolish thing!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter QUEEN</em></p>
<span id='182'>They were again together: you have done</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Not after our command. Away with her,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>And pen her up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>                  Beseech your patience. Peace,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Out of your best advice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>Nay, let her languish</span><br/>
<span id='190'>A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Die of this folly!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt CYMBELINE and Lords</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>                  Fie! you must give way.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PISANIO</em></p>
<span id='193'>Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>My lord your son drew on my master.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>Ha!</span><br/>
<span id='196'>No harm, I trust, is done?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>There might have been,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>But that my master rather play'd than fought</span><br/>
<span id='199'>And had no help of anger: they were parted</span><br/>
<span id='200'>By gentlemen at hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>I am very glad on't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.</span><br/>
<span id='203'>To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!</span><br/>
<span id='204'>I would they were in Afric both together;</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Myself by with a needle, that I might prick</span><br/>
<span id='206'>The goer-back. Why came you from your master?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='207'>On his command: he would not suffer me</span><br/>
<span id='208'>To bring him to the haven; left these notes</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Of what commands I should be subject to,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>When 't pleased you to employ me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='211'>This hath been</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour</span><br/>
<span id='213'>He will remain so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>                  I humbly thank your highness.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='216'>                  About some half-hour hence,</span><br/>
<span id='217'>I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least</span><br/>

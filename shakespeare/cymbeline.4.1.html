<em>Enter CLOTEN</em>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I am near to the place where they should meet, if</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments</span><br/>
<span id='3'>serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by</span><br/>
<span id='4'>him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the</span><br/>
<span id='5'>rather&mdash;saving reverence of the word&mdash;for 'tis said</span><br/>
<span id='6'>a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must</span><br/>
<span id='7'>play the workman. I dare speak it to myself&mdash;for it</span><br/>
<span id='8'>is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer</span><br/>
<span id='9'>in his own chamber&mdash;I mean, the lines of my body are</span><br/>
<span id='10'>as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the</span><br/>
<span id='12'>advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike</span><br/>
<span id='13'>conversant in general services, and more remarkable</span><br/>
<span id='14'>in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant</span><br/>
<span id='15'>thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy</span><br/>
<span id='17'>shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy</span><br/>
<span id='18'>mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before</span><br/>
<span id='19'>thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her</span><br/>
<span id='20'>father; who may haply be a little angry for my so</span><br/>
<span id='21'>rough usage; but my mother, having power of his</span><br/>
<span id='22'>testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My</span><br/>
<span id='23'>horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore</span><br/>
<span id='24'>purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This is</span><br/>
<span id='25'>the very description of their meeting-place; and</span><br/>
<span id='26'>the fellow dares not deceive me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

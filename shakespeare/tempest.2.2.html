<h1>The Tempest</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Another part of the island.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CALIBAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>All the infections that the sun sucks up</span><br/>
<span id='2'>From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him</span><br/>
<span id='3'>By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Fright me with urchin&mdash;shows, pitch me i' the mire,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but</span><br/>
<span id='8'>For every trifle are they set upon me;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I</span><br/>
<span id='13'>All wound with adders who with cloven tongues</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Do hiss me into madness.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter TRINCULO</em></p>
<span id='15'>Lo, now, lo!</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me</span><br/>
<span id='17'>For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Perchance he will not mind me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>TRINCULO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off</span><br/>
<span id='20'>any weather at all, and another storm brewing;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black</span><br/>
<span id='22'>cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul</span><br/>
<span id='23'>bombard that would shed his liquor. If it</span><br/>
<span id='24'>should thunder as it did before, I know not</span><br/>
<span id='25'>where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot</span><br/>
<span id='26'>choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we</span><br/>
<span id='27'>here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-</span><br/>
<span id='29'>like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-</span><br/>
<span id='30'>John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>as once I was, and had but this fish painted,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>not a holiday fool there but would give a piece</span><br/>
<span id='33'>of silver: there would this monster make a</span><br/>
<span id='34'>man; any strange beast there makes a man:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame</span><br/>
<span id='36'>beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like</span><br/>
<span id='38'>arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose</span><br/>
<span id='39'>my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a</span><br/>
<span id='41'>thunderbolt.</span><br/>
<p><em>Thunder</em></p>
<span id='42'>Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to</span><br/>
<span id='43'>creep under his gaberdine; there is no other</span><br/>
<span id='44'>shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with</span><br/>
<span id='45'>strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the</span><br/>
<span id='46'>dregs of the storm be past.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand</em></p>

<span id='51'>The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The gunner and his mate</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>But none of us cared for Kate;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>For she had a tongue with a tang,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!</span><br/>
<span id='57'>She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!</span><br/>
<span id='60'>This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.</span><br/>

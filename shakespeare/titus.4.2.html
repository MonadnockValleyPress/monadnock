<h1>Titus Andronicus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The same. A room in the palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter, from one side, AARON, DEMETRIUS, and  CHIRON; from the other side, Young LUCIUS, and an  Attendant, with a bundle of weapons, and verses writ upon them</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>He hath some message to deliver us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Young LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>My lords, with all the humbleness I may,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I greet your honours from Andronicus.</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='6'>And pray the Roman gods confound you both!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Young LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>[Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>For villains mark'd with rape.&mdash;May it please you,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>My grandsire, well advised, hath sent by me</span><br/>
<span id='11'>The goodliest weapons of his armoury</span><br/>
<span id='12'>To gratify your honourable youth,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The hope of Rome; for so he bade me say;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And so I do, and with his gifts present</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Your lordships, that, whenever you have need,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>You may be armed and appointed well:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And so I leave you both:</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='18'>like bloody villains.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Young LUCIUS, and Attendant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>What's here? A scroll; and written round about?</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Let's see;</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='21'>'Integer vitae, scelerisque purus,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Non eget Mauri jaculis, nec arcu.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>O, 'tis a verse in Horace; I know it well:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I read it in the grammar long ago.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Ay, just; a verse in Horace; right, you have it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='26'>Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Here's no sound jest! the old man hath found their guilt;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But were our witty empress well afoot,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>But let her rest in her unrest awhile.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And now, young lords, was't not a happy star</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Captives, to be advanced to this height?</span><br/>
<span id='36'>It did me good, before the palace gate</span><br/>
<span id='37'>To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>But me more good, to see so great a lord</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Basely insinuate and send us gifts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Did you not use his daughter very friendly?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>I would we had a thousand Roman dames</span><br/>
<span id='43'>At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>A charitable wish and full of love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>And that would she for twenty thousand more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Come, let us go; and pray to all the gods</span><br/>
<span id='48'>For our beloved mother in her pains.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>[Aside]  Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.</span><br/>
<p><em>Trumpets sound within</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Belike, for joy the emperor hath a son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Soft! who comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Nurse, with a blackamoor Child in her arms</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Good morr ow, lords:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!</span><br/>
<span id='60'>What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Our empress' shame, and stately Rome's disgrace!</span><br/>
<span id='63'>She is deliver'd, lords; she is deliver'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>To whom?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>       I mean, she is brought a-bed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>A devil.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Why, then she is the devil's dam; a joyful issue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>The empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>'Zounds, ye whore! is black so base a hue?</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom, sure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Villain, what hast thou done?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>That which thou canst not undo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Thou hast undone our mother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Villain, I have done thy mother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choice!</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>It shall not live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>It shall not die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>What, must it, nurse? then let no man but I</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Do execution on my flesh and blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.</span><br/>
<p><em>Takes the Child from the Nurse, and draws</em></p>
<span id='91'>Stay, murderous villains! will you kill your brother?</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>That shone so brightly when this boy was got,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point</span><br/>
<span id='95'>That touches this my first-born son and heir!</span><br/>
<span id='96'>I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>With all his threatening band of Typhon's brood,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Ye white-limed walls! ye alehouse painted signs!</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Coal-black is better than another hue,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>In that it scorns to bear another hue;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>For all the water in the ocean</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Can never turn the swan's black legs to white,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Although she lave them hourly in the flood.</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Tell the empress from me, I am of age</span><br/>
<span id='108'>To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>My mistress is my mistress; this myself,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>The vigour and the picture of my youth:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>This before all the world do I prefer;</span><br/>
<span id='113'>This maugre all the world will I keep safe,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>By this our mother is forever shamed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Rome will despise her for this foul escape.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>The emperor, in his rage, will doom her death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>I blush to think upon this ignomy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing</span><br/>
<span id='121'>The close enacts and counsels of the heart!</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Here's a young lad framed of another leer:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Look, how the black slave smiles upon the father,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.'</span><br/>
<span id='125'>He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Of that self-blood that first gave life to you,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>And from that womb where you imprison'd were</span><br/>
<span id='128'>He is enfranchised and come to light:</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Although my seal be stamped in his face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Aaron, what shall I say unto the empress?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And we will all subscribe to thy advice:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Then sit we down, and let us all consult.</span><br/>
<span id='136'>My son and I will have the wind of you:</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Keep there: now talk at pleasure of your safety.</span><br/>
<p><em>They sit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>How many women saw this child of his?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Why, so, brave lords! when we join in league,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.</span><br/>
<span id='143'>But say, again; how many saw the child?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Cornelia the midwife and myself;</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And no one else but the deliver'd empress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>The empress, the midwife, and yourself:</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Two may keep counsel when the third's away:</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Go to the empress, tell her this I said.</span><br/>
<p><em>He kills the nurse</em></p>
<span id='149'>Weke, weke! so cries a pig prepared to the spit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>What mean'st thou, Aaron? wherefore didst thou this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy:</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>A long-tongued babbling gossip? no, lords, no:</span><br/>
<span id='154'>And now be it known to you my full intent.</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Not far, one Muli lives, my countryman;</span><br/>
<span id='156'>His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>His child is like to her, fair as you are:</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And tell them both the circumstance of all;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>And how by this their child shall be advanced,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>And be received for the emperor's heir,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>And substituted in the place of mine,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>To calm this tempest whirling in the court;</span><br/>
<span id='164'>And let the emperor dandle him for his own.</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Hark ye, lords; ye see I have given her physic,</span><br/>
<p><em>Pointing to the nurse</em></p>
<span id='166'>And you must needs bestow her funeral;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms:</span><br/>
<span id='168'>This done, see that you take no longer days,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>But send the midwife presently to me.</span><br/>
<span id='170'>The midwife and the nurse well made away,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Then let the ladies tattle what they please.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air</span><br/>
<span id='173'>With secrets.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='174'>                  For this care of Tamora,</span><br/>

<p><em>Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON bearing off the Nurse's body</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies;</span><br/>
<span id='177'>There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>And secretly to greet the empress' friends.</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;</span><br/>
<span id='180'>For it is you that puts us to our shifts:</span><br/>
<span id='181'>I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>And cabin in a cave, and bring you up</span><br/>
<span id='184'>To be a warrior, and command a camp.</span><br/>

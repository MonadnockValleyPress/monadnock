<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Rousillon. The Count's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter COUNTESS, Steward, and Clown</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Steward</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I</span><br/>
<span id='3'>wish might be found in the calendar of my past</span><br/>
<span id='4'>endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make</span><br/>
<span id='5'>foul the clearness of our deservings, when of</span><br/>
<span id='6'>ourselves we publish them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>the complaints I have heard of you I do not all</span><br/>
<span id='9'>believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know</span><br/>
<span id='10'>you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability</span><br/>
<span id='11'>enough to make such knaveries yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Well, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though</span><br/>
<span id='15'>many of the rich are damned: but, if I may have</span><br/>
<span id='16'>your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel</span><br/>
<span id='17'>the woman and I will do as we may.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Wilt thou needs be a beggar?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>I do beg your good will in this case.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>In what case?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no</span><br/>
<span id='22'>heritage: and I think I shall never have the</span><br/>
<span id='23'>blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for</span><br/>
<span id='24'>they say barnes are blessings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on</span><br/>
<span id='27'>by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Is this all your worship's reason?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they</span><br/>
<span id='30'>are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>May the world know them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and</span><br/>
<span id='33'>all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry</span><br/>
<span id='34'>that I may repent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have</span><br/>
<span id='37'>friends for my wife's sake.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Such friends are thine enemies, knave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the</span><br/>
<span id='40'>knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>He that ears my land spares my team and gives me</span><br/>
<span id='42'>leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my</span><br/>
<span id='43'>drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher</span><br/>
<span id='44'>of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh</span><br/>
<span id='45'>and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my</span><br/>
<span id='46'>flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses</span><br/>
<span id='47'>my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to</span><br/>
<span id='48'>be what they are, there were no fear in marriage;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in</span><br/>
<span id='51'>religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl</span><br/>
<span id='52'>horns together, like any deer i' the herd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next</span><br/>
<span id='55'>way:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>For I the ballad will repeat,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Which men full true shall find;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Your marriage comes by destiny,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Your cuckoo sings by kind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Steward</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to</span><br/>
<span id='62'>you: of her I am to speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Helen, I mean.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>     Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Why the Grecians sacked Troy?</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Fond done, done fond,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Was this King Priam's joy?</span><br/>
<span id='69'>With that she sighed as she stood,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>With that she sighed as she stood,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And gave this sentence then;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Among nine bad if one be good,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Among nine bad if one be good,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>There's yet one good in ten.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying</span><br/>
<span id='77'>o' the song: would God would serve the world so all</span><br/>
<span id='78'>the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we</span><br/>
<span id='80'>might have a good woman born but one every blazing</span><br/>
<span id='81'>star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery</span><br/>
<span id='82'>well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck</span><br/>
<span id='83'>one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>That man should be at woman's command, and yet no</span><br/>
<span id='86'>hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it</span><br/>
<span id='87'>will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of</span><br/>
<span id='88'>humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am</span><br/>
<span id='89'>going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Well, now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Steward</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and</span><br/>
<span id='93'>she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully</span><br/>
<span id='94'>make title to as much love as she finds: there is</span><br/>
<span id='95'>more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid</span><br/>
<span id='96'>her than she'll demand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Steward</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Madam, I was very late more near her than I think</span><br/>
<span id='98'>she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate</span><br/>
<span id='99'>to herself her own words to her own ears; she</span><br/>
<span id='100'>thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any</span><br/>
<span id='101'>stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put</span><br/>
<span id='103'>such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no</span><br/>
<span id='104'>god, that would not extend his might, only where</span><br/>
<span id='105'>qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that</span><br/>
<span id='106'>would suffer her poor knight surprised, without</span><br/>
<span id='107'>rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>This she delivered in the most bitter touch of</span><br/>
<span id='109'>sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I</span><br/>
<span id='110'>held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns</span><br/>
<span id='112'>you something to know it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>You have discharged this honestly; keep it to</span><br/>
<span id='114'>yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this</span><br/>
<span id='115'>before, which hung so tottering in the balance that</span><br/>
<span id='116'>I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you</span><br/>
<span id='118'>for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Steward</em></p>
<p><em>Enter HELENA</em></p>
<span id='119'>Even so it was with me when I was young:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>It is the show and seal of nature's truth,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>By our remembrances of days foregone,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>What is your pleasure, madam?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>You know, Helen,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>I am a mother to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Mine honourable mistress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Nay, a mother:</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,'</span><br/>
<span id='135'>That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And put you in the catalogue of those</span><br/>
<span id='137'>That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds</span><br/>
<span id='139'>A native slip to us from foreign seeds:</span><br/>
<span id='140'>You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Yet I express to you a mother's care:</span><br/>
<span id='142'>God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood</span><br/>
<span id='143'>To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>That this distemper'd messenger of wet,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Why? that you are my daughter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>That I am not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>I say, I am your mother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Pardon, madam;</span><br/>
<span id='150'>The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:</span><br/>
<span id='151'>I am from humble, he from honour'd name;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>No note upon my parents, his all noble:</span><br/>
<span id='153'>My master, my dear lord he is; and I</span><br/>
<span id='154'>His servant live, and will his vassal die:</span><br/>
<span id='155'>He must not be my brother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Nor I your mother?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>You are my mother, madam; would you were,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>So that my lord your son were not my brother,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>I care no more for than I do for heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>So I were not his sister. Can't no other,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:</span><br/>
<span id='164'>God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother</span><br/>
<span id='165'>So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?</span><br/>
<span id='166'>My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see</span><br/>
<span id='167'>The mystery of your loneliness, and find</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross</span><br/>
<span id='169'>You love my son; invention is ashamed,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Against the proclamation of thy passion,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes</span><br/>
<span id='174'>See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors</span><br/>
<span id='175'>That in their kind they speak it: only sin</span><br/>
<span id='176'>And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?</span><br/>
<span id='178'>If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;</span><br/>
<span id='179'>If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Tell me truly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>                  Good madam, pardon me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>Do you love my son?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>Your pardon, noble mistress!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>Love you my son?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>                  Do not you love him, madam?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose</span><br/>
<span id='189'>The state of your affection; for your passions</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Have to the full appeach'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>Then, I confess,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>That before you, and next unto high heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>I love your son.</span><br/>
<span id='195'>My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Be not offended; for it hurts not him</span><br/>
<span id='197'>That he is loved of me: I follow him not</span><br/>
<span id='198'>By any token of presumptuous suit;</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Yet never know how that desert should be.</span><br/>
<span id='201'>I know I love in vain, strive against hope;</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Yet in this captious and intenible sieve</span><br/>
<span id='203'>I still pour in the waters of my love</span><br/>
<span id='204'>And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Religious in mine error, I adore</span><br/>
<span id='206'>The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Let not your hate encounter with my love</span><br/>
<span id='209'>For loving where you do: but if yourself,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Did ever in so true a flame of liking</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian</span><br/>
<span id='213'>Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity</span><br/>
<span id='214'>To her, whose state is such that cannot choose</span><br/>
<span id='215'>But lend and give where she is sure to lose;</span><br/>
<span id='216'>That seeks not to find that her search implies,</span><br/>
<span id='217'>But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>Had you not lately an intent,&mdash;speak truly,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='219'>To go to Paris?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='220'>                  Madam, I had.</span><br/>

<span id='speech55'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>

<span id='221'>Wherefore? tell true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='222'>I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.</span><br/>
<span id='223'>You know my father left me some prescriptions</span><br/>
<span id='224'>Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading</span><br/>
<span id='225'>And manifest experience had collected</span><br/>
<span id='226'>For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me</span><br/>
<span id='227'>In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,</span><br/>
<span id='228'>As notes whose faculties inclusive were</span><br/>
<span id='229'>More than they were in note: amongst the rest,</span><br/>
<span id='230'>There is a remedy, approved, set down,</span><br/>
<span id='231'>To cure the desperate languishings whereof</span><br/>
<span id='232'>The king is render'd lost.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='233'>This was your motive</span><br/>
<span id='234'>For Paris, was it? speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='235'>My lord your son made me to think of this;</span><br/>
<span id='236'>Else Paris and the medicine and the king</span><br/>
<span id='237'>Had from the conversation of my thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='238'>Haply been absent then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='239'>But think you, Helen,</span><br/>
<span id='240'>If you should tender your supposed aid,</span><br/>
<span id='241'>He would receive it? he and his physicians</span><br/>
<span id='242'>Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,</span><br/>
<span id='243'>They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit</span><br/>
<span id='244'>A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,</span><br/>
<span id='245'>Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off</span><br/>
<span id='246'>The danger to itself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='247'>There's something in't,</span><br/>
<span id='248'>More than my father's skill, which was the greatest</span><br/>
<span id='249'>Of his profession, that his good receipt</span><br/>
<span id='250'>Shall for my legacy be sanctified</span><br/>
<span id='251'>By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour</span><br/>
<span id='252'>But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture</span><br/>
<span id='253'>The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure</span><br/>
<span id='254'>By such a day and hour.</span><br/>

<span id='257'>Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,</span><br/>
<span id='258'>Means and attendants and my loving greetings</span><br/>
<span id='259'>To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home</span><br/>
<span id='260'>And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:</span><br/>
<span id='261'>Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,</span><br/>
<span id='262'>What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>We have beat him to his camp: run one before,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood</span><br/>
<span id='4'>That has to-day escaped. I thank you all;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>For doughty-handed are you, and have fought</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Not as you served the cause, but as 't had been</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Wash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss</span><br/>
<span id='11'>The honour'd gashes whole.</span><br/>
<p><em>To SCARUS</em></p>
<span id='12'>Give me thy hand</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CLEOPATRA, attended</em></p>
<span id='13'>To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Make her thanks bless thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>To CLEOPATRA</em></p>
<span id='15'>O thou day o' the world,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Through proof of harness to my heart, and there</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Ride on the pants triumphing!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Lord of lords!</span><br/>
<span id='20'>O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling from</span><br/>
<span id='21'>The world's great snare uncaught?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>My nightingale,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>We have beat them to their beds. What, girl!</span><br/>
<span id='24'>though grey</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we</span><br/>
<span id='26'>A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day</span><br/>
<span id='30'>As if a god, in hate of mankind, had</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Destroy'd in such a shape.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I'll give thee, friend,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>An armour all of gold; it was a king's.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>He has deserved it, were it carbuncled</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Through Alexandria make a jolly march;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Had our great palace the capacity</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To camp this host, we all would sup together,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And drink carouses to the next day's fate,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>With brazen din blast you the city's ear;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Make mingle with rattling tabourines;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Applauding our approach.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<span id='speech1'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>In half an hour she promised to return.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.</span><br/>
<span id='4'>O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Driving back shadows over louring hills:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Now is the sun upon the highmost hill</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Is three long hours, yet she is not come.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Had she affections and warm youthful blood,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>She would be as swift in motion as a ball;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>My words would bandy her to my sweet love,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And his to me:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>But old folks, many feign as they were dead;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>O God, she comes!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Nurse and PETER</em></p>
<span id='19'>O honey nurse, what news?</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Peter, stay at the gate.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit PETER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Now, good sweet nurse,&mdash;O Lord, why look'st thou sad?</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news</span><br/>
<span id='25'>By playing it to me with so sour a face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Do you not see that I am out of breath?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath</span><br/>
<span id='33'>To say to me that thou art out of breath?</span><br/>
<span id='34'>The excuse that thou dost make in this delay</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not</span><br/>
<span id='40'>how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his</span><br/>
<span id='41'>face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels</span><br/>
<span id='42'>all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>though they be not to be talked on, yet they are</span><br/>
<span id='44'>past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy</span><br/>
<span id='46'>ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>No, no: but all this did I know before.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>What says he of our marriage? what of that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!</span><br/>
<span id='50'>It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.</span><br/>
<span id='51'>My back o' t' other side,&mdash;O, my back, my back!</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Beshrew your heart for sending me about,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>To catch my death with jaunting up and down!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a</span><br/>
<span id='57'>courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I</span><br/>
<span id='58'>warrant, a virtuous,&mdash;Where is your mother?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Where is my mother! why, she is within;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!</span><br/>
<span id='61'>'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Where is your mother?'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>O God's lady dear!</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Is this the poultice for my aching bones?</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Henceforward do your messages yourself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>I have.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>There stays a husband to make you a wife:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Hie you to church; I must another way,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>To fetch a ladder, by the which your love</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>I am the drudge and toil in your delight,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>But you shall bear the burden soon at night.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and the Officer</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Fear me not, man; I will not break away:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.</span><br/>
<span id='4'>My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And will not lightly trust the messenger</span><br/>
<span id='6'>That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a rope's-end</em></p>
<span id='8'>Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>But where's the money?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Beating him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Good sir, be patient.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Good, now, hold thy tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Thou whoreson, senseless villain!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel</span><br/>
<span id='24'>your blows.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an</span><br/>
<span id='26'>ass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long</span><br/>
<span id='28'>ears. I have served him from the hour of my</span><br/>
<span id='29'>nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his</span><br/>
<span id='30'>hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he</span><br/>
<span id='31'>heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me</span><br/>
<span id='32'>with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with</span><br/>
<span id='34'>it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when</span><br/>
<span id='35'>I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a</span><br/>
<span id='36'>beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath</span><br/>
<span id='37'>lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and PINCH</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or</span><br/>
<span id='40'>rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the</span><br/>
<span id='41'>rope's-end.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Wilt thou still talk?</span><br/>
<p><em>Beating him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Courtezan</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>How say you now? is not your husband mad?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>His incivility confirms no less.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Establish him in his true sense again,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And I will please you what you will demand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Courtezan</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PINCH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.</span><br/>
<p><em>Striking him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PINCH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>To yield possession to my holy prayers</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>You minion, you, are these your customers?</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Did this companion with the saffron face</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Revel and feast it at my house to-day,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And I denied to enter in my house?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>O husband, God doth know you dined at home;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Where would you had remain'd until this time,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Free from these slanders and this open shame!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>And did not she herself revile me there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>And did not I in rage depart from thence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>In verity you did; my bones bear witness,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>That since have felt the vigour of his rage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>PINCH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>But surely master, not a rag of money.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>He came to me and I deliver'd it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>And I am witness with her that she did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>God and the rope-maker bear me witness</span><br/>
<span id='89'>That I was sent for nothing but a rope!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>PINCH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>I know it by their pale and deadly looks:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>They must be bound and laid in some dark room.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>And, gentle master, I received no gold;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And art confederate with a damned pack</span><br/>
<span id='101'>To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes</span><br/>
<span id='103'>That would behold in me this shameful sport.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>PINCH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>More company! The fiend is strong within him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them</span><br/>
<span id='109'>To make a rescue?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>                  Masters, let him go</span><br/>
<span id='111'>He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>PINCH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.</span><br/>
<p><em>They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Hast thou delight to see a wretched man</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Do outrage and displeasure to himself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>He is my prisoner: if I let him go,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>The debt he owes will be required of me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Home to my house. O most unhappy day!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>O most unhappy strumpet!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Master, I am here entered in bond for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master:</span><br/>
<span id='127'>cry 'The devil!'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but Adriana, Luciana, Officer and Courtezan</em></p>
<span id='130'>Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>I know the man. What is the sum he owes?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Two hundred ducats.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Say, how grows it due?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Due for a chain your husband had of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>Courtezan</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>When as your husband all in rage to-day</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Came to my house and took away my ring&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>The ring I saw upon his finger now&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Straight after did I meet him with a chain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>It may be so, but I did never see it.</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:</span><br/>
<span id='143'>I long to know the truth hereof at large.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier drawn, and DROMIO of Syracuse</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>And come with naked swords.</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Let's call more help to have them bound again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Away! they'll kill us.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>I see these witches are afraid of swords.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>She that would be your wife now ran from you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:</span><br/>
<span id='151'>I long that we were safe and sound aboard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us</span><br/>
<span id='153'>no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:</span><br/>
<span id='154'>methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for</span><br/>
<span id='155'>the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of</span><br/>
<span id='156'>me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and</span><br/>
<span id='157'>turn witch.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>I will not stay to-night for all the town;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

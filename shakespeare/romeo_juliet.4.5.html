<span id='1'>Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!</span><br/>
<span id='4'>What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>The County Paris hath set up his rest,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!</span><br/>
<span id='9'>I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Ay, let the county take you in your bed;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?</span><br/>
<p><em>Undraws the curtains</em></p>
<span id='12'>What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!</span><br/>
<span id='13'>I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!</span><br/>
<span id='15'>O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LADY CAPULET</em></p>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>

<span id='17'>What noise is here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>O lamentable day!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>What is the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Look, look! O heavy day!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>O me, O me! My child, my only life,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Help, help! Call help.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CAPULET</em></p>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Life and these lips have long been separated:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Death lies on her like an untimely frost</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.</span><br/>

<span id='32'>O lamentable day!</span><br/>

<span id='34'>Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians</em></p>

<span id='speech14'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Come, is the bride ready to go to church?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Ready to go, but never to return.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>O son! the night before thy wedding-day</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Flower as she was, deflowered by him.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Have I thought long to see this morning's face,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And doth it give me such a sight as this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Most miserable hour that e'er time saw</span><br/>
<span id='48'>In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!</span><br/>
<span id='49'>But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>But one thing to rejoice and solace in,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Most lamentable day, most woful day,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>That ever, ever, I did yet behold!</span><br/>
<span id='55'>O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Never was seen so black a day as this:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>O woful day, O woful day!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!</span><br/>
<span id='61'>O love! O life! not life, but love in death!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now</span><br/>
<span id='64'>To murder, murder our solemnity?</span><br/>
<span id='65'>O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And with my child my joys are buried.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not</span><br/>
<span id='69'>In these confusions. Heaven and yourself</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And all the better is it for the maid:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Your part in her you could not keep from death,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>The most you sought was her promotion;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?</span><br/>
<span id='78'>O, in this love, you love your child so ill,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>That you run mad, seeing that she is well:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>She's not well married that lives married long;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>But she's best married that dies married young.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary</span><br/>
<span id='83'>On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>In all her best array bear her to church:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>For though fond nature bids us an lament,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>All things that we ordained festival,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Turn from their office to black funeral;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Our instruments to melancholy bells,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And all things change them to the contrary.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>FRIAR LAURENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare</span><br/>
<span id='96'>To follow this fair corse unto her grave:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Move them no more by crossing their high will.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE</em></p>

<span id='speech24'><strong>First Musician</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>First Musician</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PETER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's</span><br/>
<span id='104'>ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>First Musician</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Why 'Heart's ease?'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>PETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My</span><br/>
<span id='107'>heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>to comfort me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>First Musician</strong></span>

<span id='109'>Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.</span><br/>

<span id='speech31'><strong>PETER</strong></span>

<span id='110'>You will not, then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>First Musician</strong></span>

<span id='111'>No.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>PETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>I will then give it you soundly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>First Musician</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>What will you give us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>PETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>No money, on my faith, but the gleek;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>I will give you the minstrel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>First Musician</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Then I will give you the serving-creature.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>PETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on</span><br/>
<span id='118'>your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>I'll fa you; do you note me?</span><br/>

<span id='speech38'><strong>First Musician</strong></span>

<span id='120'>An you re us and fa us, you note us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>Second Musician</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you</span><br/>
<span id='123'>with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer</span><br/>
<span id='124'>me like men:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>'When griping grief the heart doth wound,</span><br/>

<span id='128'>why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver</span><br/>
<span id='129'>sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Musician</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>PETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Second Musician</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.</span><br/>

<span id='133'>Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>Third Musician</strong></span>

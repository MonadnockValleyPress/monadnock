<h1>The Merry Wives of Windsor</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene VI</h3>
<h4>Another room in the Garter Inn.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter FENTON and Host</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy: I</span><br/>
<span id='2'>will give over all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>FENTON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give thee</span><br/>
<span id='5'>A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>I will hear you, Master Fenton; and I will at the</span><br/>
<span id='7'>least keep your counsel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>FENTON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>From time to time I have acquainted you</span><br/>
<span id='9'>With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>So far forth as herself might be her chooser,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Even to my wish: I have a letter from her</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Of such contents as you will wonder at;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>That neither singly can be manifested,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Without the show of both; fat Falstaff</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Hath a great scene: the image of the jest</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>While other jests are something rank on foot,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Her father hath commanded her to slip</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Away with Slender and with him at Eton</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Her mother, ever strong against that match</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed</span><br/>
<span id='28'>That he shall likewise shuffle her away,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>While other sports are tasking of their minds,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And at the deanery, where a priest attends,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot</span><br/>
<span id='32'>She seemingly obedient likewise hath</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Her father means she shall be all in white,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And in that habit, when Slender sees his time</span><br/>
<span id='36'>To take her by the hand and bid her go,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>The better to denote her to the doctor,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>The maid hath given consent to go with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Which means she to deceive, father or mother?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>FENTON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Both, my good host, to go along with me:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicar</span><br/>
<span id='48'>To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And, in the lawful name of marrying,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>To give our hearts united ceremony.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Well, husband your device; I'll to the vicar:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>FENTON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>So shall I evermore be bound to thee;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Besides, I'll make a present recompense.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

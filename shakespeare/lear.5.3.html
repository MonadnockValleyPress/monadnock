<h1>King Lear</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The British camp near Dover.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter, in conquest, with drum and colours, EDMUND,  KING LEAR and CORDELIA, prisoners; Captain, Soldiers,  &amp;c</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Some officers take them away: good guard,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Until their greater pleasures first be known</span><br/>
<span id='3'>That are to censure them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>We are not the first</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Who, with best meaning, have incurr'd the worst.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh</span><br/>
<span id='14'>At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And take upon's the mystery of things,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>That ebb and flow by the moon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Take them away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?</span><br/>
<span id='24'>He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve</span><br/>
<span id='28'>first. Come.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt KING LEAR and CORDELIA, guarded</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Come hither, captain; hark.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Take thou this note;</span><br/>
<p><em>Giving a paper</em></p>
<span id='31'>go follow them to prison:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost</span><br/>
<span id='33'>As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way</span><br/>
<span id='34'>To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Are as the time is: to be tender-minded</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Does not become a sword: thy great employment</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Or thrive by other means.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>I'll do 't, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>About it; and write happy when thou hast done.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Mark, I say, instantly; and carry it so</span><br/>
<span id='42'>As I have set it down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>If it be man's work, I'll do 't.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Flourish. Enter ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, another Captain, and Soldiers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And fortune led you well: you have the captives</span><br/>
<span id='47'>That were the opposites of this day's strife:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>We do require them of you, so to use them</span><br/>
<span id='49'>As we shall find their merits and our safety</span><br/>
<span id='50'>May equally determine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Sir, I thought it fit</span><br/>
<span id='52'>To send the old and miserable king</span><br/>
<span id='53'>To some retention and appointed guard;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>To pluck the common bosom on his side,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>An turn our impress'd lances in our eyes</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>My reason all the same; and they are ready</span><br/>
<span id='59'>To-morrow, or at further space, to appear</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Where you shall hold your session. At this time</span><br/>
<span id='61'>We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed</span><br/>
<span id='63'>By those that feel their sharpness:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>The question of Cordelia and her father</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Requires a fitter place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Sir, by your patience,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>I hold you but a subject of this war,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Not as a brother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>                  That's as we list to grace him.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Bore the commission of my place and person;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>The which immediacy may well stand up,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And call itself your brother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Not so hot:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>In his own grace he doth exalt himself,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>More than in your addition.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>In my rights,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>By me invested, he compeers the best.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>That were the most, if he should husband you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Jesters do oft prove prophets.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Holla, holla!</span><br/>
<span id='83'>That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Lady, I am not well; else I should answer</span><br/>
<span id='85'>From a full-flowing stomach. General,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Witness the world, that I create thee here</span><br/>
<span id='89'>My lord and master.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Mean you to enjoy him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>The let-alone lies not in your good will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Nor in thine, lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Half-blooded fellow, yes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>[To EDMUND]  Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee</span><br/>
<span id='96'>On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>This gilded serpent</span><br/>
<p><em>Pointing to Goneril</em></p>
<span id='98'>For your claim, fair sister,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>I bar it in the interest of my wife:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And I, her husband, contradict your bans.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>If you will marry, make your loves to me,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>My lady is bespoke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>An interlude!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Thou art arm'd, Gloucester: let the trumpet sound:</span><br/>
<span id='106'>If none appear to prove upon thy head</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>There is my pledge;</span><br/>
<p><em>Throwing down a glove</em></p>
<span id='109'>I'll prove it on thy heart,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Than I have here proclaim'd thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Sick, O, sick!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>

<span id='113'>[Aside]  If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>

<span id='114'>There's my exchange:</span><br/>
<p><em>Throwing down a glove</em></p>
<span id='115'>what in the world he is</span><br/>
<span id='116'>That names me traitor, villain-like he lies:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>On him, on you, who not? I will maintain</span><br/>
<span id='119'>My truth and honour firmly.</span><br/>

<span id='124'>Took their discharge.</span><br/>

<h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Mantua. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ROMEO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>I dreamt my lady came and found me dead&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave</span><br/>
<span id='8'>to think!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>That I revived, and was an emperor.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BALTHASAR, booted</em></p>
<span id='13'>News from Verona!&mdash;How now, Balthasar!</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?</span><br/>
<span id='15'>How doth my lady? Is my father well?</span><br/>
<span id='16'>How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>For nothing can be ill, if she be well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BALTHASAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And her immortal part with angels lives.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And presently took post to tell it you:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Since you did leave it for my office, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BALTHASAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>I do beseech you, sir, have patience:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Your looks are pale and wild, and do import</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Some misadventure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>                  Tush, thou art deceived:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BALTHASAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>No, my good lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>                  No matter: get thee gone,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit BALTHASAR</em></p>
<span id='37'>Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!</span><br/>
<span id='40'>I do remember an apothecary,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And hereabouts he dwells,&mdash;which late I noted</span><br/>
<span id='42'>In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>An alligator stuff'd, and other skins</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves</span><br/>
<span id='48'>A beggarly account of empty boxes,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Noting this penury, to myself I said</span><br/>
<span id='53'>'An if a man did need a poison now,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Whose sale is present death in Mantua,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'</span><br/>
<span id='56'>O, this same thought did but forerun my need;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And this same needy man must sell it me.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>As I remember, this should be the house.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>What, ho! apothecary!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Apothecary</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Apothecary</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Who calls so loud?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have</span><br/>
<span id='64'>A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear</span><br/>
<span id='65'>As will disperse itself through all the veins</span><br/>
<span id='66'>That the life-weary taker may fall dead</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And that the trunk may be discharged of breath</span><br/>
<span id='68'>As violently as hasty powder fired</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Apothecary</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Is death to any he that utters them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>The world affords no law to make thee rich;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Apothecary</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>My poverty, but not my will, consents.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Apothecary</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Put this in any liquid thing you will,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And drink it off; and, if you had the strength</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ROMEO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Doing more murders in this loathsome world,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.</span><br/>
<span id='87'>I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Come, cordial and not poison, go with me</span><br/>
<span id='90'>To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

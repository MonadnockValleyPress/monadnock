<h1>Two Gentlemen of Verona</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Milan. Outside the Duke's palace, under Silvia's chamber.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter PROTEUS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Already have I been false to Valentine</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Under the colour of commending him,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>I have access my own love to prefer:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>When I protest true loyalty to her,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>When to her beauty I commend my vows,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>She bids me think how I have been forsworn</span><br/>
<span id='11'>In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>The more it grows and fawneth on her still.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And give some evening music to her ear.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter THURIO and Musicians</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>THURIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Ay, gentle Thurio: for you know that love</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Will creep in service where it cannot go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>THURIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>THURIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Who? Silvia?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>                  Ay, Silvia; for your sake.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>THURIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter, at a distance, Host, and JULIA in boy's clothes</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly: I</span><br/>
<span id='28'>pray you, why is it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Come, we'll have you merry: I'll bring you where</span><br/>
<span id='31'>you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>But shall I hear him speak?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Ay, that you shall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>That will be music.</span><br/>
<p><em>Music plays</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Hark, hark!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Is he among these?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Ay: but, peace! let's hear 'em.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>SONG.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Who is Silvia? what is she,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>That all our swains commend her?</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Holy, fair and wise is she;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>The heaven such grace did lend her,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>That she might admired be.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Is she kind as she is fair?</span><br/>
<span id='45'>For beauty lives with kindness.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Love doth to her eyes repair,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>To help him of his blindness,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And, being help'd, inhabits there.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Then to Silvia let us sing,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>That Silvia is excelling;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>She excels each mortal thing</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Upon the dull earth dwelling:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>To her let us garlands bring.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>How now! are you sadder than you were before? How</span><br/>
<span id='55'>do you, man? the music likes you not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>You mistake; the musician likes me not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Why, my pretty youth?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>He plays false, father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>How? out of tune on the strings?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very</span><br/>
<span id='61'>heart-strings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>You have a quick ear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>I perceive you delight not in music.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Not a whit, when it jars so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Hark, what fine change is in the music!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Ay, that change is the spite.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>You would have them always play but one thing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>I would always have one play but one thing.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Often resort unto this gentlewoman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he loved</span><br/>
<span id='73'>her out of all nick.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Where is Launce?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Gone to seek his dog; which tomorrow, by his</span><br/>
<span id='76'>master's command, he must carry for a present to his lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Peace! stand aside: the company parts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead</span><br/>
<span id='79'>That you shall say my cunning drift excels.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>THURIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Where meet we?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>                  At Saint Gregory's well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>THURIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt THURIO and Musicians</em></p>
<p><em>Enter SILVIA above</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Madam, good even to your ladyship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>SILVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>I thank you for your music, gentlemen.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Who is that that spake?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>SILVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Sir Proteus, as I take it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>SILVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>What's your will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>                  That I may compass yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>SILVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>You have your wish; my will is even this:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>That presently you hie you home to bed.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man!</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>To be seduced by thy flattery,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>That hast deceived so many with thy vows?</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Return, return, and make thy love amends.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>I am so far from granting thy request</span><br/>
<span id='101'>That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>And by and by intend to chide myself</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;</span><br/>
<span id='105'>But she is dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>[Aside]        'Twere false, if I should speak it;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>For I am sure she is not buried.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>SILVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Survives; to whom, thyself art witness,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>I am betroth'd: and art thou not ashamed</span><br/>
<span id='111'>To wrong him with thy importunacy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>SILVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>And so suppose am I; for in his grave</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Assure thyself my love is buried.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>SILVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>[Aside]  He heard not that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>The picture that is hanging in your chamber;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>For since the substance of your perfect self</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And to your shadow will I make true love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>[Aside]  If 'twere a substance, you would, sure,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>deceive it,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>And make it but a shadow, as I am.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>SILVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>I am very loath to be your idol, sir;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>But since your falsehood shall become you well</span><br/>
<span id='131'>To worship shadows and adore false shapes,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Send to me in the morning and I'll send it:</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And so, good rest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>                  As wretches have o'ernight</span><br/>
<span id='135'>That wait for execution in the morn.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt PROTEUS and SILVIA severally</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Host, will you go?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>By my halidom, I was fast asleep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>Host</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost</span><br/>
<span id='140'>day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>JULIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Not so; but it hath been the longest night</span><br/>
<span id='142'>That e'er I watch'd and the most heaviest.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

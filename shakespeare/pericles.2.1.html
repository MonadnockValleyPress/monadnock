<span id='2'>Wind, rain, and thunder, remember, earthly man</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Is but a substance that must yield to you;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And I, as fits my nature, do obey you:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Wash'd me from shore to shore, and left me breath</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Nothing to think on but ensuing death:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Let it suffice the greatness of your powers</span><br/>
<span id='9'>To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And having thrown him from your watery grave,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter three FISHERMEN</em></p>

<span id='17'>fetch thee with a wanion.</span><br/>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Third Fisherman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men that</span><br/>
<span id='19'>were cast away before us even now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>First Fisherman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear what</span><br/>
<span id='21'>pitiful cries they made to us to help them, when,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Third Fisherman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the</span><br/>
<span id='24'>porpus how he bounced and tumbled? they say</span><br/>
<span id='25'>they're half fish, half flesh: a plague on them,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>they ne'er come but I look to be washed. Master, I</span><br/>
<span id='27'>marvel how the fishes live in the sea.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>First Fisherman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the</span><br/>
<span id='29'>little ones: I can compare our rich misers to</span><br/>
<span id='30'>nothing so fitly as to a whale; a' plays and</span><br/>
<span id='31'>tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at</span><br/>
<span id='32'>last devours them all at a mouthful: such whales</span><br/>
<span id='33'>have I heard on o' the land, who never leave gaping</span><br/>
<span id='34'>till they've swallowed the whole parish, church,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>steeple, bells, and all.</span><br/>

<span id='37'>But, master, if I had been the sexton, I would have</span><br/>
<span id='38'>been that day in the belfry.</span><br/>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Second Fisherman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Why, man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Third Fisherman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Because he should have swallowed me too: and when I</span><br/>
<span id='41'>had been in his belly, I would have kept such a</span><br/>
<span id='42'>jangling of the bells, that he should never have</span><br/>
<span id='43'>left, till he cast bells, steeple, church, and</span><br/>
<span id='44'>parish up again. But if the good King Simonides</span><br/>
<span id='45'>were of my mind,&mdash;</span><br/>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Second Fisherman</strong></span>

<span id='54'>Honest! good fellow, what's that? If it be a day</span><br/>

<h1>A Midsummer Night's Dream</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>The same. Lysander, Demetrius, Helena, and Hermia</h4>

<blockquote>
<span id='1'>lying asleep.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter TITANIA and BOTTOM; PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH,  MUSTARDSEED, and other Fairies attending; OBERON behind unseen</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Where's Peaseblossom?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>PEASEBLOSSOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Ready.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>COBWEB</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Ready.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your</span><br/>
<span id='11'>weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped</span><br/>
<span id='12'>humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good</span><br/>
<span id='13'>mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret</span><br/>
<span id='14'>yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>I would be loath to have you overflown with a</span><br/>
<span id='17'>honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MUSTARDSEED</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Ready.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>leave your courtesy, good mounsieur.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MUSTARDSEED</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>What's your Will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb</span><br/>
<span id='23'>to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for</span><br/>
<span id='24'>methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I</span><br/>
<span id='25'>am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>I must scratch.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>What, wilt thou hear some music,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>my sweet love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have</span><br/>
<span id='30'>the tongs and the bones.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good</span><br/>
<span id='33'>dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle</span><br/>
<span id='34'>of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>I have a venturous fairy that shall seek</span><br/>
<span id='36'>The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I</span><br/>
<span id='39'>have an exposition of sleep come upon me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt fairies</em></p>
<span id='42'>So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Gently entwist; the female ivy so</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!</span><br/>
<p><em>They sleep</em></p>
<p><em>Enter PUCK</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>[Advancing]  Welcome, good Robin.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>See'st thou this sweet sight?</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Her dotage now I do begin to pity:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>For, meeting her of late behind the wood,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>I did upbraid her and fall out with her;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>For she his hairy temples then had rounded</span><br/>
<span id='53'>With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And that same dew, which sometime on the buds</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>When I had at my pleasure taunted her</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>I then did ask of her her changeling child;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent</span><br/>
<span id='62'>To bear him to my bower in fairy land.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And now I have the boy, I will undo</span><br/>
<span id='64'>This hateful imperfection of her eyes:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp</span><br/>
<span id='66'>From off the head of this Athenian swain;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>That, he awaking when the other do,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>May all to Athens back again repair</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And think no more of this night's accidents</span><br/>
<span id='70'>But as the fierce vexation of a dream.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>But first I will release the fairy queen.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Be as thou wast wont to be;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>See as thou wast wont to see:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Hath such force and blessed power.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>My Oberon! what visions have I seen!</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>There lies your love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>How came these things to pass?</span><br/>
<span id='81'>O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Titania, music call; and strike more dead</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Than common sleep of all these five the sense.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!</span><br/>
<p><em>Music, still</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Now, when thou wakest, with thine</span><br/>
<span id='87'>own fool's eyes peep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Now thou and I are new in amity,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And will to-morrow midnight solemnly</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And bless it to all fair prosperity:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Fairy king, attend, and mark:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>I do hear the morning lark.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>OBERON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Then, my queen, in silence sad,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Trip we after the night's shade:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>We the globe can compass soon,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Swifter than the wandering moon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Come, my lord, and in our flight</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Tell me how it came this night</span><br/>
<span id='104'>That I sleeping here was found</span><br/>
<span id='105'>With these mortals on the ground.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
<p><em>Horns winded within</em></p>
<p><em>Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Go, one of you, find out the forester;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>For now our observation is perform'd;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And since we have the vaward of the day,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>My love shall hear the music of my hounds.</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit an Attendant</em></p>
<span id='112'>We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>And mark the musical confusion</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Of hounds and echo in conjunction.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear</span><br/>
<span id='117'>With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>The skies, the fountains, every region near</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard</span><br/>
<span id='121'>So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung</span><br/>
<span id='124'>With ears that sweep away the morning dew;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Each under each. A cry more tuneable</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>EGEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>I wonder of their being here together.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>No doubt they rose up early to observe</span><br/>
<span id='136'>The rite of May, and hearing our intent,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Came here in grace our solemnity.</span><br/>
<span id='138'>But speak, Egeus; is not this the day</span><br/>
<span id='139'>That Hermia should give answer of her choice?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>EGEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>It is, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.</span><br/>
<p><em>Horns and shout within. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA wake and start up</em></p>
<span id='142'>Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Pardon, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>                  I pray you all, stand up.</span><br/>
<span id='146'>I know you two are rival enemies:</span><br/>
<span id='147'>How comes this gentle concord in the world,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>That hatred is so far from jealousy,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>My lord, I shall reply amazedly,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>I cannot truly say how I came here;</span><br/>
<span id='153'>But, as I think,&mdash;for truly would I speak,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>And now do I bethink me, so it is,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='155'>I came with Hermia hither: our intent</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Without the peril of the Athenian law.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>EGEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:</span><br/>
<span id='159'>I beg the law, the law, upon his head.</span><br/>
<span id='160'>They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Thereby to have defeated you and me,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>You of your wife and me of my consent,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Of my consent that she should be your wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Of this their purpose hither to this wood;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And I in fury hither follow'd them,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Fair Helena in fancy following me.</span><br/>
<span id='168'>But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>But by some power it is,&mdash;my love to Hermia,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Melted as the snow, seems to me now</span><br/>
<span id='171'>As the remembrance of an idle gaud</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Which in my childhood I did dote upon;</span><br/>
<span id='173'>And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>The object and the pleasure of mine eye,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Is only Helena. To her, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:</span><br/>
<span id='177'>But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;</span><br/>
<span id='178'>But, as in health, come to my natural taste,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>And will for evermore be true to it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>THESEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Of this discourse we more will hear anon.</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Egeus, I will overbear your will;</span><br/>
<span id='184'>For in the temple by and by with us</span><br/>
<span id='185'>These couples shall eternally be knit:</span><br/>
<span id='186'>And, for the morning now is something worn,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Away with us to Athens; three and three,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Come, Hippolyta.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>These things seem small and undistinguishable,</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HERMIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Methinks I see these things with parted eye,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>When every thing seems double.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>HELENA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>So methinks:</span><br/>
<span id='195'>And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Mine own, and not mine own.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>Are you sure</span><br/>
<span id='198'>That we are awake? It seems to me</span><br/>
<span id='199'>That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think</span><br/>
<span id='200'>The duke was here, and bid us follow him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HERMIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>Yea; and my father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>HELENA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>And Hippolyta.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>And he did bid us follow to the temple.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him</span><br/>
<span id='205'>And by the way let us recount our dreams.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>[Awaking]  When my cue comes, call me, and I will</span><br/>
<span id='207'>answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho!</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen</span><br/>
<span id='210'>hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare</span><br/>
<span id='211'>vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to</span><br/>
<span id='212'>say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go</span><br/>
<span id='213'>about to expound this dream. Methought I was&mdash;there</span><br/>
<span id='214'>is no man can tell what. Methought I was,&mdash;and</span><br/>
<span id='215'>methought I had,&mdash;but man is but a patched fool, if</span><br/>
<span id='216'>he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye</span><br/>
<span id='217'>of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not</span><br/>
<span id='218'>seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue</span><br/>
<span id='219'>to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream</span><br/>
<span id='220'>was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of</span><br/>
<span id='221'>this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream,</span><br/>
<span id='222'>because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the</span><br/>
<span id='223'>latter end of a play, before the duke:</span><br/>
<span id='224'>peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall</span><br/>
<span id='225'>sing it at her death.</span><br/>

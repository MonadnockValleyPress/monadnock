<h1>Henry VI, Part 3</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene VI</h3>
<h4>London. The Tower.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLARENCE, WARWICK,  SOMERSET, HENRY OF RICHMOND, OXFORD, MONTAGUE, and Lieutenant of the Tower</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Master lieutenant, now that God and friends</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And turn'd my captive state to liberty,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>At our enlargement what are thy due fees?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Lieutenant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>But if an humble prayer may prevail,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>I then crave pardon of your majesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>For what, lieutenant? for well using me?</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Conceive when after many moody thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='14'>At last by notes of household harmony</span><br/>
<span id='15'>They quite forget their loss of liberty.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>He was the author, thou the instrument.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite</span><br/>
<span id='20'>By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And that the people of this blessed land</span><br/>
<span id='22'>May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I here resign my government to thee,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And now may seem as wise as virtuous,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>For few men rightly temper with the stars:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>For choosing me when Clarence is in place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>To whom the heavens in thy nativity</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>As likely to be blest in peace and war;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And therefore I yield thee my free consent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>And I choose Clarence only for protector.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>That no dissension hinder government:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>I make you both protectors of this land,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>While I myself will lead a private life</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And in devotion spend my latter days,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>For on thy fortune I repose myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>We'll yoke together, like a double shadow</span><br/>
<span id='50'>To Henry's body, and supply his place;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>I mean, in bearing weight of government,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>While he enjoys the honour and his ease.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And all his lands and goods be confiscate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>What else? and that succession be determined.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>But, with the first of all your chief affairs,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Let me entreat, for I command no more,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>That Margaret your queen and my son Edward</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Be sent for, to return from France with speed;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear</span><br/>
<span id='63'>My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Of whom you seem to have so tender care?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Come hither, England's hope.</span><br/>
<p><em>Lays his hand on his head</em></p>
<span id='69'>If secret powers</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>His looks are full of peaceful majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>His head by nature framed to wear a crown,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Likely in time to bless a regal throne.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Make much of him, my lords, for this is he</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Must help you more than you are hurt by me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Post</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>What news, my friend?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Post</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>That Edward is escaped from your brother,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Post</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And the Lord Hastings, who attended him</span><br/>
<span id='84'>In secret ambush on the forest side</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>For hunting was his daily exercise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>My brother was too careless of his charge.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide</span><br/>
<span id='89'>A salve for any sore that may betide.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but SOMERSET, HENRY OF RICHMOND, and OXFORD</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And we shall have more wars before 't be long.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>As Henry's late presaging prophecy</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts</span><br/>
<span id='96'>What may befall him, to his harm and ours:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Till storms be past of civil enmity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>OXFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Come, therefore, let's about it speedily.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

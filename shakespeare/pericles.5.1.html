<h1>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>On board Pericles' ship, off Mytilene.</h4>

<blockquote>
<span id='1'>A close pavilion on deck, with a curtain before it; PERICLES</span><br/>
<span id='2'>within it, reclined on a couch. A barge lying</span><br/>
<span id='3'>beside the Tyrian vessel.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter two Sailors, one belonging to the Tyrian vessel, the other to the barge; to them HELICANUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Tyrian Sailor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>[To the Sailor of Mytilene]  Where is lord Helicanus?</span><br/>
<span id='5'>he can resolve you.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>O, here he is.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Sir, there's a barge put off from Mytilene,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And in it is Lysimachus the governor,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>That he have his. Call up some gentlemen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Tyrian Sailor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Ho, gentlemen! my lord calls.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter two or three Gentlemen</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Doth your lordship call?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Gentlemen, there's some of worth would come aboard;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>I pray ye, greet them fairly.</span><br/>
<p><em>The Gentlemen and the two Sailors descend, and go on board the barge</em></p>
<p><em>Enter, from thence, LYSIMACHUS and Lords; with the Gentlemen and the two Sailors</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Tyrian Sailor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Sir,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>This is the man that can, in aught you would,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Resolve you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Hail, reverend sir! the gods preserve you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And die as I would do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>You wish me well.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Being on shore, honouring of Neptune's triumphs,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I made to it, to know of whence you are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>First, what is your place?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>I am the governor of this place you lie before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Sir,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>A man who for this three months hath not spoken</span><br/>
<span id='30'>To any one, nor taken sustenance</span><br/>
<span id='31'>But to prorogue his grief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Upon what ground is his distemperature?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>'Twould be too tedious to repeat;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>But the main grief springs from the loss</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Of a beloved daughter and a wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>May we not see him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>You may;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Yet let me obtain my wish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Behold him.</span><br/>
<p><em>PERICLES discovered</em></p>
<span id='41'>This was a goodly person,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Till the disaster that, one mortal night,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Drove him to this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Sir king, all hail! the gods preserve you!</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Hail, royal sir!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>It is in vain; he will not speak to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Sir,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>We have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Would win some words of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>'Tis well bethought.</span><br/>
<span id='51'>She questionless with her sweet harmony</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And other chosen attractions, would allure,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And make a battery through his deafen'd parts,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Which now are midway stopp'd:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>She is all happy as the fairest of all,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And, with her fellow maids is now upon</span><br/>
<span id='57'>The leafy shelter that abuts against</span><br/>
<span id='58'>The island's side.</span><br/>
<p><em>Whispers a Lord, who goes off in the barge of LYSIMACHUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Sure, all's effectless; yet nothing we'll omit</span><br/>
<span id='60'>That bears recovery's name. But, since your kindness</span><br/>
<span id='61'>We have stretch'd thus far, let us beseech you</span><br/>
<span id='62'>That for our gold we may provision have,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Wherein we are not destitute for want,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>But weary for the staleness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>O, sir, a courtesy</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Which if we should deny, the most just gods</span><br/>
<span id='67'>For every graff would send a caterpillar,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And so afflict our province. Yet once more</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Let me entreat to know at large the cause</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Of your king's sorrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Sit, sir, I will recount it to you:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>But, see, I am prevented.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter, from the barge, Lord, with MARINA, and a young Lady</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>O, here is</span><br/>
<span id='74'>The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Is't not a goodly presence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>She's a gallant lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>She's such a one, that, were I well assured</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>I'ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Expect even here, where is a kingly patient:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>If that thy prosperous and artificial feat</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay</span><br/>
<span id='85'>As thy desires can wish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Sir, I will use</span><br/>
<span id='87'>My utmost skill in his recovery, Provided</span><br/>
<span id='88'>That none but I and my companion maid</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Be suffer'd to come near him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Come, let us leave her;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And the gods make her prosperous!</span><br/>
<p><em>MARINA sings</em></p>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LYSIMACHUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Mark'd he your music?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>No, nor look'd on us.</span><br/>

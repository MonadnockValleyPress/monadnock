<span id='3'>I warrant. What, Robin, I say!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Servants with a basket</em></p>

<span id='6'>Give your men the charge; we must be brief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be</span><br/>
<span id='8'>ready here hard by in the brew-house: and when I</span><br/>
<span id='9'>suddenly call you, come forth, and without any pause</span><br/>
<span id='10'>or staggering take this basket on your shoulders:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>that done, trudge with it in all haste, and carry</span><br/>
<span id='12'>it among the whitsters in Datchet-mead, and there</span><br/>
<span id='13'>empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames side.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>You will do it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>I ha' told them over and over; they lack no</span><br/>
<span id='16'>direction. Be gone, and come when you are called.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Servants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>

<span id='17'>Here comes little Robin.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ROBIN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>How now, my eyas-musket! what news with you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ROBIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>My master, Sir John, is come in at your back-door,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Mistress Ford, and requests your company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ROBIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Ay, I'll be sworn. My master knows not of your</span><br/>
<span id='23'>being here and hath threatened to put me into</span><br/>
<span id='24'>everlasting liberty if I tell you of it; for he</span><br/>
<span id='25'>swears he'll turn me away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Thou'rt a good boy: this secrecy of thine shall be</span><br/>
<span id='27'>a tailor to thee and shall make thee a new doublet</span><br/>
<span id='28'>and hose. I'll go hide me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit ROBIN</em></p>
<span id='30'>Mistress Page, remember you your cue.</span><br/>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>

<span id='31'>I warrant thee; if I do not act it, hiss me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<span id='speech18'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Go to, then: we'll use this unwholesome humidity,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>this gross watery pumpion; we'll teach him to know</span><br/>
<span id='34'>turtles from jays.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter FALSTAFF</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel? Why, now let</span><br/>
<span id='36'>me die, for I have lived long enough: this is the</span><br/>
<span id='37'>period of my ambition: O this blessed hour!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>O sweet Sir John!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would</span><br/>
<span id='41'>thy husband were dead: I'll speak it before the</span><br/>
<span id='42'>best lord; I would make thee my lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>I your lady, Sir John! alas, I should be a pitiful lady!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Let the court of France show me such another. I see</span><br/>
<span id='45'>how thine eye would emulate the diamond: thou hast</span><br/>
<span id='46'>the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the</span><br/>
<span id='47'>ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Venetian admittance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>A plain kerchief, Sir John: my brows become nothing</span><br/>
<span id='50'>else; nor that well neither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so: thou</span><br/>
<span id='52'>wouldst make an absolute courtier; and the firm</span><br/>
<span id='53'>fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion</span><br/>
<span id='54'>to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see</span><br/>
<span id='55'>what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature</span><br/>
<span id='56'>thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Believe me, there is no such thing in me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>What made me love thee? let that persuade thee</span><br/>
<span id='59'>there's something extraordinary in thee. Come, I</span><br/>
<span id='60'>cannot cog and say thou art this and that, like a</span><br/>
<span id='61'>many of these lisping hawthorn-buds, that come like</span><br/>
<span id='62'>women in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury</span><br/>
<span id='63'>in simple time; I cannot: but I love thee; none</span><br/>
<span id='64'>but thee; and thou deservest it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love Mistress Page.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek</span><br/>
<span id='68'>of a lime-kiln.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall one</span><br/>
<span id='70'>day find it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not</span><br/>
<span id='73'>be in that mind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ROBIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>[Within]  Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! here's</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Mistress Page at the door, sweating and blowing and</span><br/>
<span id='76'>looking wildly, and would needs speak with you presently.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>She shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the arras.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Pray you, do so: she's a very tattling woman.</span><br/>
<p><em>FALSTAFF hides himself</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN</em></p>
<span id='79'>What's the matter? how now!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>you're overthrown, you're undone for ever!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>What's the matter, good Mistress Page?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>O well-a-day, Mistress Ford! having an honest man</span><br/>
<span id='84'>to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>What cause of suspicion?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>What cause of suspicion! Out pon you! how am I</span><br/>
<span id='87'>mistook in you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Why, alas, what's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all the</span><br/>
<span id='90'>officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that</span><br/>
<span id='91'>he says is here now in the house by your consent, to</span><br/>
<span id='92'>take an ill advantage of his assence: you are undone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>'Tis not so, I hope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man</span><br/>
<span id='95'>here! but 'tis most certain your husband's coming,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a</span><br/>
<span id='97'>one. I come before to tell you. If you know</span><br/>
<span id='98'>yourself clear, why, I am glad of it; but if you</span><br/>
<span id='99'>have a friend here convey, convey him out. Be not</span><br/>
<span id='100'>amazed; call all your senses to you; defend your</span><br/>
<span id='101'>reputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>What shall I do? There is a gentleman my dear</span><br/>
<span id='103'>friend; and I fear not mine own shame so much as his</span><br/>
<span id='104'>peril: I had rather than a thousand pound he were</span><br/>
<span id='105'>out of the house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>For shame! never stand 'you had rather' and 'you</span><br/>
<span id='107'>had rather:' your husband's here at hand, bethink</span><br/>
<span id='108'>you of some conveyance: in the house you cannot</span><br/>
<span id='109'>hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here</span><br/>
<span id='110'>is a basket: if he be of any reasonable stature, he</span><br/>
<span id='111'>may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as</span><br/>
<span id='112'>if it were going to bucking: or&mdash;it is whiting-time</span><br/>
<span id='113'>&mdash;send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?</span><br/>

<span id='speech55'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>

<span id='speech67'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>

<span id='157'>I think my husband hath some special suspicion of</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>MISTRESS PAGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>I will lay a plot to try that; and we will yet have</span><br/>

<h1>Coriolanus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene VI</H3>
<h4>Rome. A public place.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>His remedies are tame i' the present peace</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And quietness of the people, which before</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Our tradesmen with in their shops and going</span><br/>
<span id='9'>About their functions friendly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>We stood to't in good time.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MENENIUS</em></p>
<span id='11'>Is this Menenius?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Both Tribunes</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Hail sir!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>        Hail to you both!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Your Coriolanus</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Were he more angry at it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>All's well; and might have been much better, if</span><br/>
<span id='20'>He could have temporized.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Where is he, hear you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Hear nothing from him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter three or four Citizens</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Citizens</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>The gods preserve you both!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>God-den, our neighbours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>God-den to you all, god-den to you all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>First Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Are bound to pray for you both.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Live, and thrive!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Had loved you as we did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Citizens</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Now the gods keep you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Both Tribunes</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Farewell, farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Citizens</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>This is a happier and more comely time</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Than when these fellows ran about the streets,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Crying confusion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>                  Caius Marcius was</span><br/>
<span id='38'>A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Self-loving,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>                  And affecting one sole throne,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Without assistance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>I think not so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>We should by this, to all our lamentation,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>If he had gone forth consul, found it so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>The gods have well prevented it, and Rome</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Sits safe and still without him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter an AEdile</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>AEdile</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Worthy tribunes,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Reports, the Volsces with two several powers</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Are enter'd in the Roman territories,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And with the deepest malice of the war</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Destroy what lies before 'em.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>'Tis Aufidius,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And durst not once peep out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Come, what talk you</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Of Marcius?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be</span><br/>
<span id='62'>The Volsces dare break with us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Cannot be!</span><br/>
<span id='64'>We have record that very well it can,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And three examples of the like have been</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Within my age. But reason with the fellow,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Before you punish him, where he heard this,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Lest you shall chance to whip your information</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And beat the messenger who bids beware</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Of what is to be dreaded.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Tell not me:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>I know this cannot be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Not possible.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>The nobles in great earnestness are going</span><br/>
<span id='75'>All to the senate-house: some news is come</span><br/>
<span id='76'>That turns their countenances.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>'Tis this slave;&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:&mdash;his raising;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Nothing but his report.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Yes, worthy sir,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>The slave's report is seconded; and more,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>More fearful, is deliver'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>What more fearful?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>It is spoke freely out of many mouths&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>How probable I do not know&mdash;that Marcius,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And vows revenge as spacious as between</span><br/>
<span id='88'>The young'st and oldest thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>This is most likely!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Good Marcius home again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>The very trick on't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>This is unlikely:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>He and Aufidius can no more atone</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Than violentest contrariety.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a second Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Second Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>You are sent for to the senate:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Associated with Aufidius, rages</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Upon our territories; and have already</span><br/>
<span id='100'>O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took</span><br/>
<span id='101'>What lay before them.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter COMINIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>O, you have made good work!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>What news? what news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>You have holp to ravish your own daughters and</span><br/>
<span id='105'>To melt the city leads upon your pates,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>What's the news? what's the news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Your temples burned in their cement, and</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Into an auger's bore.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Pray now, your news?</span><br/>
<span id='112'>You have made fair work, I fear me.&mdash;Pray, your news?&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='113'>If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>If!</span><br/>
<span id='115'>He is their god: he leads them like a thing</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Made by some other deity than nature,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>That shapes man better; and they follow him,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Against us brats, with no less confidence</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Or butchers killing flies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>You have made good work,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much</span><br/>
<span id='123'>on the voice of occupation and</span><br/>
<span id='124'>The breath of garlic-eaters!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>He will shake</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Your Rome about your ears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>As Hercules</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Did shake down mellow fruit.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>You have made fair work!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>But is this true, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Ay; and you'll look pale</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Before you find it other. All the regions</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Do smilingly revolt; and who resist</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Your enemies and his find something in him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>We are all undone, unless</span><br/>
<span id='138'>The noble man have mercy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Who shall ask it?</span><br/>
<span id='140'>The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Deserve such pity of him as the wolf</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even</span><br/>
<span id='144'>As those should do that had deserved his hate,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And therein show'd like enemies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>'Tis true:</span><br/>
<span id='147'>If he were putting to my house the brand</span><br/>
<span id='148'>That should consume it, I have not the face</span><br/>
<span id='149'>To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>You have brought</span><br/>
<span id='152'>A trembling upon Rome, such as was never</span><br/>
<span id='153'>So incapable of help.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>Both Tribunes</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Say not we brought it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts</span><br/>
<span id='156'>And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Who did hoot him out o' the city.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>But I fear</span><br/>
<span id='159'>They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>The second name of men, obeys his points</span><br/>
<span id='161'>As if he were his officer: desperation</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Is all the policy, strength and defence,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>That Rome can make against them.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a troop of Citizens</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Here come the clusters.</span><br/>
<span id='165'>And is Aufidius with him? You are they</span><br/>
<span id='166'>That made the air unwholesome, when you cast</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>And not a hair upon a soldier's head</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs</span><br/>
<span id='171'>As you threw caps up will he tumble down,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;</span><br/>
<span id='173'>if he could burn us all into one coal,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>We have deserved it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>Citizens</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>Faith, we hear fearful news.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>First Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>For mine own part,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>And so did I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very</span><br/>
<span id='180'>many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and</span><br/>
<span id='181'>though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet</span><br/>
<span id='182'>it was against our will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>Ye re goodly things, you voices!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>You have made</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>O, ay, what else?</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:</span><br/>
<span id='188'>These are a side that would be glad to have</span><br/>
<span id='189'>This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>And show no sign of fear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>First Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.</span><br/>
<span id='192'>I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished</span><br/>
<span id='193'>him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>So did we all. But, come, let's home.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Citizens</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>I do not like this news.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>Nor I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Would buy this for a lie!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>

<span id='199'>Pray, let us go.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

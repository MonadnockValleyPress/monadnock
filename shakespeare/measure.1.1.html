<h1>Measure for Measure</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>An apartment in the Duke's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Escalus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>My lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Of government the properties to unfold,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Since I am put to know that your own science</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice</span><br/>
<span id='7'>My strength can give you: then no more remains,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>But that to your sufficiency as your worth is able,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And let them work. The nature of our people,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Our city's institutions, and the terms</span><br/>
<span id='11'>For common justice, you're as pregnant in</span><br/>
<span id='12'>As art and practise hath enriched any</span><br/>
<span id='13'>That we remember. There is our commission,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>I say, bid come before us Angelo.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit an Attendant</em></p>
<span id='16'>What figure of us think you he will bear?</span><br/>
<span id='17'>For you must know, we have with special soul</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Elected him our absence to supply,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And given his deputation all the organs</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Of our own power: what think you of it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>If any in Vienna be of worth</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To undergo such ample grace and honour,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>It is Lord Angelo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>                  Look where he comes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ANGELO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Always obedient to your grace's will,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>I come to know your pleasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Angelo,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>There is a kind of character in thy life,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>That to the observer doth thy history</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Are not thine own so proper as to waste</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike</span><br/>
<span id='37'>As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd</span><br/>
<span id='38'>But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends</span><br/>
<span id='39'>The smallest scruple of her excellence</span><br/>
<span id='40'>But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Herself the glory of a creditor,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech</span><br/>
<span id='43'>To one that can my part in him advertise;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Hold therefore, Angelo:&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>In our remove be thou at full ourself;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Mortality and mercy in Vienna</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Though first in question, is thy secondary.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Take thy commission.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Now, good my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Let there be some more test made of my metal,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Before so noble and so great a figure</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Be stamp'd upon it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>No more evasion:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Our haste from hence is of so quick condition</span><br/>
<span id='58'>That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>As time and our concernings shall importune,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>How it goes with us, and do look to know</span><br/>
<span id='62'>What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>To the hopeful execution do I leave you</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Of your commissions.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Yet give leave, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>That we may bring you something on the way.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>My haste may not admit it;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do</span><br/>
<span id='69'>With any scruple; your scope is as mine own</span><br/>
<span id='70'>So to enforce or qualify the laws</span><br/>
<span id='71'>As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>I'll privily away. I love the people,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>But do not like to stage me to their eyes:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Though it do well, I do not relish well</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Their loud applause and Aves vehement;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Nor do I think the man of safe discretion</span><br/>
<span id='77'>That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>The heavens give safety to your purposes!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>I thank you. Fare you well.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave</span><br/>
<span id='82'>To have free speech with you; and it concerns me</span><br/>
<span id='83'>To look into the bottom of my place:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>A power I have, but of what strength and nature</span><br/>
<span id='85'>I am not yet instructed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ANGELO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And we may soon our satisfaction have</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Touching that point.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>I'll wait upon your honour.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

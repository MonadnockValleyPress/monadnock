<h3>Act I, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The island. Before Prospero's cell.</h4>

<em>Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA</em>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>If by your art, my dearest father, you have</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered</span><br/>
<span id='6'>With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Had I been any god of power, I would</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere</span><br/>
<span id='12'>It should the good ship so have swallow'd and</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The fraughting souls within her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Be collected:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>No more amazement: tell your piteous heart</span><br/>
<span id='16'>There's no harm done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>O, woe the day!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>No harm.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I have done nothing but in care of thee,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Of whence I am, nor that I am more better</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And thy no greater father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>More to know</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Did never meddle with my thoughts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>'Tis time</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And pluck my magic garment from me. So:</span><br/>
<p><em>Lays down his mantle</em></p>
<span id='30'>Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd</span><br/>
<span id='32'>The very virtue of compassion in thee,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>I have with such provision in mine art</span><br/>
<span id='34'>So safely ordered that there is no soul&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>No, not so much perdition as an hair</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Betid to any creature in the vessel</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>For thou must now know farther.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>You have often</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And left me to a bootless inquisition,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>The hour's now come;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember</span><br/>
<span id='46'>A time before we came unto this cell?</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Out three years old.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Certainly, sir, I can.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>By what? by any other house or person?</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Of any thing the image tell me that</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Hath kept with thy remembrance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>'Tis far off</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And rather like a dream than an assurance</span><br/>
<span id='55'>That my remembrance warrants. Had I not</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Four or five women once that tended me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it</span><br/>
<span id='58'>That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else</span><br/>
<span id='59'>In the dark backward and abysm of time?</span><br/>
<span id='60'>If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>How thou camest here thou mayst.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>But that I do not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Thy father was the Duke of Milan and</span><br/>
<span id='65'>A prince of power.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>                  Sir, are not you my father?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and</span><br/>
<span id='68'>She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And princess no worse issued.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>O the heavens!</span><br/>
<span id='72'>What foul play had we, that we came from thence?</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Or blessed was't we did?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Both, both, my girl:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>But blessedly holp hither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>O, my heart bleeds</span><br/>
<span id='78'>To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>I pray thee, mark me&mdash;that a brother should</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Be so perfidious!&mdash;he whom next thyself</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Of all the world I loved and to him put</span><br/>
<span id='84'>The manage of my state; as at that time</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Through all the signories it was the first</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed</span><br/>
<span id='87'>In dignity, and for the liberal arts</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Without a parallel; those being all my study,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>The government I cast upon my brother</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And to my state grew stranger, being transported</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Dost thou attend me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Sir, most heedfully.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Being once perfected how to grant suits,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>How to deny them, who to advance and who</span><br/>
<span id='96'>To trash for over-topping, new created</span><br/>
<span id='97'>The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state</span><br/>
<span id='100'>To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was</span><br/>
<span id='101'>The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>O, good sir, I do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>                  I pray thee, mark me.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated</span><br/>
<span id='106'>To closeness and the bettering of my mind</span><br/>
<span id='107'>With that which, but by being so retired,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Like a good parent, did beget of him</span><br/>
<span id='111'>A falsehood in its contrary as great</span><br/>
<span id='112'>As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Not only with what my revenue yielded,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>But what my power might else exact, like one</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Who having into truth, by telling of it,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Made such a sinner of his memory,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>To credit his own lie, he did believe</span><br/>
<span id='119'>He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution</span><br/>
<span id='120'>And executing the outward face of royalty,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Dost thou hear?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>                  Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>To have no screen between this part he play'd</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And him he play'd it for, he needs will be</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties</span><br/>
<span id='128'>He thinks me now incapable; confederates&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>So dry he was for sway&mdash;wi' the King of Naples</span><br/>
<span id='130'>To give him annual tribute, do him homage,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Subject his coronet to his crown and bend</span><br/>
<span id='132'>The dukedom yet unbow'd&mdash;alas, poor Milan!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>To most ignoble stooping.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>O the heavens!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Mark his condition and the event; then tell me</span><br/>
<span id='136'>If this might be a brother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>I should sin</span><br/>
<span id='138'>To think but nobly of my grandmother:</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Good wombs have borne bad sons.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Now the condition.</span><br/>
<span id='141'>The King of Naples, being an enemy</span><br/>
<span id='142'>To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Of homage and I know not how much tribute,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Should presently extirpate me and mine</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan</span><br/>
<span id='147'>With all the honours on my brother: whereon,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>A treacherous army levied, one midnight</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Fated to the purpose did Antonio open</span><br/>
<span id='150'>The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>The ministers for the purpose hurried thence</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Me and thy crying self.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Alack, for pity!</span><br/>
<span id='154'>I, not remembering how I cried out then,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint</span><br/>
<span id='156'>That wrings mine eyes to't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Hear a little further</span><br/>
<span id='158'>And then I'll bring thee to the present business</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Which now's upon's; without the which this story</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Were most impertinent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>Wherefore did they not</span><br/>
<span id='162'>That hour destroy us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Well demanded, wench:</span><br/>
<span id='164'>My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>So dear the love my people bore me, nor set</span><br/>
<span id='166'>A mark so bloody on the business, but</span><br/>
<span id='167'>With colours fairer painted their foul ends.</span><br/>
<span id='168'>In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared</span><br/>
<span id='170'>A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh</span><br/>
<span id='174'>To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Did us but loving wrong.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>Alack, what trouble</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Was I then to you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>                  O, a cherubim</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Infused with a fortitude from heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me</span><br/>
<span id='183'>An undergoing stomach, to bear up</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Against what should ensue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>How came we ashore?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>By Providence divine.</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Some food we had and some fresh water that</span><br/>
<span id='188'>A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Out of his charity, being then appointed</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Master of this design, did give us, with</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me</span><br/>
<span id='194'>From mine own library with volumes that</span><br/>
<span id='195'>I prize above my dukedom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>

<span id='198'>Now I arise:</span><br/>
<p><em>Resumes his mantle</em></p>
<span id='199'>Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Here in this island we arrived; and here</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Than other princesses can that have more time</span><br/>
<span id='203'>For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.</span><br/>

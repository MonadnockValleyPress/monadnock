<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>The British camp, near Dover.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter, with drum and colours, EDMUND, REGAN, Gentlemen, and Soldiers.</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Or whether since he is advised by aught</span><br/>
<span id='3'>To change the course: he's full of alteration</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And self-reproving: bring his constant pleasure.</span><br/>
<p><em>To a Gentleman, who goes out</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>'Tis to be doubted, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Now, sweet lord,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>You know the goodness I intend upon you:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Tell me&mdash;but truly&mdash;but then speak the truth,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Do you not love my sister?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>In honour'd love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>But have you never found my brother's way</span><br/>
<span id='13'>To the forfended place?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>That thought abuses you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>I am doubtful that you have been conjunct</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>No, by mine honour, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>I never shall endure her: dear my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Be not familiar with her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Fear me not:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>She and the duke her husband!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter, with drum and colours, ALBANY, GONERIL, and Soldiers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>[Aside]  I had rather lose the battle than that sister</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Should loosen him and me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Our very loving sister, well be-met.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Sir, this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>With others whom the rigor of our state</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I never yet was valiant: for this business,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>It toucheth us, as France invades our land,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Not bolds the king, with others, whom, I fear,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Most just and heavy causes make oppose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Sir, you speak nobly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Why is this reason'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Combine together 'gainst the enemy;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>For these domestic and particular broils</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Are not the question here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Let's then determine</span><br/>
<span id='38'>With the ancient of war on our proceedings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>I shall attend you presently at your tent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Sister, you'll go with us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>No.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>'Tis most convenient; pray you, go with us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>[Aside]  O, ho, I know the riddle.&mdash;I will go.</span><br/>
<p><em>As they are going out, enter EDGAR disguised</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Hear me one word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>                  I'll overtake you. Speak.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but ALBANY and EDGAR</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>If you have victory, let the trumpet sound</span><br/>
<span id='49'>For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>I can produce a champion that will prove</span><br/>
<span id='51'>What is avouched there. If you miscarry,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Your business of the world hath so an end,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And machination ceases. Fortune love you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Stay till I have read the letter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>I was forbid it.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And I'll appear again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit EDGAR</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter EDMUND</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Here is the guess of their true strength and forces</span><br/>
<span id='61'>By diligent discovery; but your haste</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Is now urged on you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>We will greet the time.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>To both these sisters have I sworn my love;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Each jealous of the other, as the stung</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>If both remain alive: to take the widow</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And hardly shall I carry out my side,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Her husband being alive. Now then we'll use</span><br/>
<span id='72'>His countenance for the battle; which being done,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Let her who would be rid of him devise</span><br/>
<span id='74'>His speedy taking off. As for the mercy</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>The battle done, and they within our power,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Shall never see his pardon; for my state</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Stands on me to defend, not to debate.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<h1>Richard III</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene VII</h3>
<h4>Baynard's Castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, at several doors</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>How now, my lord, what say the citizens?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>The citizens are mum and speak not a word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And his contract by deputy in France;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>The insatiate greediness of his desires,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And his enforcement of the city wives;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>As being got, your father then in France,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>His resemblance, being not like the duke;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Withal I did infer your lineaments,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Being the right idea of your father,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Both in your form and nobleness of mind;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Laid open all your victories in Scotland,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And when mine oratory grew to an end</span><br/>
<span id='21'>I bid them that did love their country's good</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Ah! and did they so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>No, so God help me, they spake not a word;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Which when I saw, I reprehended them;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>His answer was, the people were not wont</span><br/>
<span id='30'>To be spoke to but by the recorder.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Then he was urged to tell my tale again,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'</span><br/>
<span id='33'>But nothing spake in warrant from himself.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>When he had done, some followers of mine own,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And thus I took the vantage of those few,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>'This general applause and loving shout</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And even here brake off, and came away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>No, by my troth, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And be not easily won to our request:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>I go; and if you plead as well for them</span><br/>
<span id='53'>As I can say nay to thee for myself,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit GLOUCESTER</em></p>
<p><em>Enter the Lord Mayor and Citizens</em></p>
<span id='56'>Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>I think the duke will not be spoke withal.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CATESBY</em></p>
<span id='58'>Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>What says he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CATESBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>             My lord: he doth entreat your grace;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>To visit him to-morrow or next day:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>He is within, with two right reverend fathers,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Divinely bent to meditation;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And no worldly suit would he be moved,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>To draw him from his holy exercise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>In deep designs and matters of great moment,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>No less importing than our general good,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Are come to have some conference with his grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CATESBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>I'll tell him what you say, my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!</span><br/>
<span id='73'>He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>But on his knees at meditation;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>But meditating with two deep divines;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Happy were England, would this gracious prince</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:</span><br/>
<span id='81'>But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Lord Mayor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>I fear he will.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter CATESBY</em></p>
<span id='84'>How now, Catesby, what says your lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CATESBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>My lord,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>He wonders to what end you have assembled</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Such troops of citizens to speak with him,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>His grace not being warn'd thereof before:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Sorry I am my noble cousin should</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And so once more return and tell his grace.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit CATESBY</em></p>
<span id='94'>When holy and devout religious men</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>So sweet is zealous contemplation.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two Bishops. CATESBY returns</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Lord Mayor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>See, where he stands between two clergymen!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>To stay him from the fall of vanity:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>True ornaments to know a holy man.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Lend favourable ears to our request;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And pardon us the interruption</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>My lord, there needs no such apology:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>I rather do beseech you pardon me,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Who, earnest in the service of my God,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Neglect the visitation of my friends.</span><br/>
<span id='110'>But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>I do suspect I have done some offence</span><br/>
<span id='114'>That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>At our entreaties, to amend that fault!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Then know, it is your fault that you resign</span><br/>
<span id='120'>The supreme seat, the throne majestical,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>The scepter'd office of your ancestors,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Your state of fortune and your due of birth,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>The lineal glory of your royal house,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>To the corruption of a blemished stock:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Which here we waken to our country's good,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Her face defaced with scars of infamy,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Which to recure, we heartily solicit</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Your gracious self to take on you the charge</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And kingly government of this your land,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Not as protector, steward, substitute,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Or lowly factor for another's gain;</span><br/>
<span id='137'>But as successively from blood to blood,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Your right of birth, your empery, your own.</span><br/>
<span id='139'>For this, consorted with the citizens,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Your very worshipful and loving friends,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>And by their vehement instigation,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>In this just suit come I to move your grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>I know not whether to depart in silence,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Best fitteth my degree or your condition</span><br/>
<span id='146'>If not to answer, you might haply think</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded</span><br/>
<span id='148'>To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Which fondly you would here impose on me;</span><br/>
<span id='150'>If to reprove you for this suit of yours,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>So season'd with your faithful love to me.</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Definitively thus I answer you.</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Unmeritable shuns your high request.</span><br/>
<span id='158'>First if all obstacles were cut away,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And that my path were even to the crown,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>As my ripe revenue and due by birth</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>So mighty and so many my defects,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>As I had rather hide me from my greatness,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Than in my greatness covet to be hid,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.</span><br/>
<span id='167'>But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>And much I need to help you, if need were;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Will well become the seat of majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.</span><br/>
<span id='173'>On him I lay what you would lay on me,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>The right and fortune of his happy stars;</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Which God defend that I should wring from him!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;</span><br/>
<span id='177'>But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>All circumstances well considered.</span><br/>
<span id='179'>You say that Edward is your brother's son:</span><br/>
<span id='180'>So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;</span><br/>
<span id='181'>For first he was contract to Lady Lucy&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Your mother lives a witness to that vow&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='183'>And afterward by substitute betroth'd</span><br/>
<span id='184'>To Bona, sister to the King of France.</span><br/>
<span id='185'>These both put by a poor petitioner,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>A care-crazed mother of a many children,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>A beauty-waning and distressed widow,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Even in the afternoon of her best days,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='191'>To base declension and loathed bigamy</span><br/>
<span id='192'>By her, in his unlawful bed, he got</span><br/>
<span id='193'>This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.</span><br/>
<span id='194'>More bitterly could I expostulate,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Save that, for reverence to some alive,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>I give a sparing limit to my tongue.</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Then, good my lord, take to your royal self</span><br/>
<span id='198'>This proffer'd benefit of dignity;</span><br/>
<span id='199'>If non to bless us and the land withal,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry</span><br/>
<span id='201'>From the corruption of abusing times,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Unto a lineal true-derived course.</span><br/>

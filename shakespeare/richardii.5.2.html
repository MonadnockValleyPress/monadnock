<h1>Richard II</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene II</H3>
<h4>The Duke of York's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DUKE OF YORK and DUCHESS OF YORK</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>When weeping made you break the story off,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>of our two cousins coming into London.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Where did I leave?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>                  At that sad stop, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>With slow but stately pace kept on his course,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Bolingbroke!'</span><br/>
<span id='14'>You would have thought the very windows spake,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>So many greedy looks of young and old</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Through casements darted their desiring eyes</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Upon his visage, and that all the walls</span><br/>
<span id='18'>With painted imagery had said at once</span><br/>
<span id='19'>'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>As in a theatre, the eyes of men,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Are idly bent on him that enters next,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Thinking his prattle to be tedious;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'</span><br/>
<span id='31'>No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>His face still combating with tears and smiles,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>The badges of his grief and patience,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd</span><br/>
<span id='37'>The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And barbarism itself have pitied him.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>But heaven hath a hand in these events,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>To whose high will we bound our calm contents.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Whose state and honour I for aye allow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Here comes my son Aumerle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Aumerle that was;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>But that is lost for being Richard's friend,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I am in parliament pledge for his truth</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And lasting fealty to the new-made king.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Welcome, my son: who are the violets now</span><br/>
<span id='50'>That strew the green lap of the new come spring?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>God knows I had as lief be none as one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>For aught I know, my lord, they do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>You will be there, I know.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>If God prevent not, I purpose so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>My lord, 'tis nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>No matter, then, who see it;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>I do beseech your grace to pardon me:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>It is a matter of small consequence,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Which for some reasons I would not have seen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.</span><br/>
<span id='68'>I fear, I fear,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>                  What should you fear?</span><br/>
<span id='70'>'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into</span><br/>
<span id='71'>For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond</span><br/>
<span id='73'>That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Boy, let me see the writing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.</span><br/>
<p><em>He plucks it out of his bosom and reads it</em></p>
<span id='77'>Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>What is the matter, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Ho! who is within there?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Servant</em></p>
<span id='80'>Saddle my horse.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>God for his mercy, what treachery is here!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Why, what is it, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>I will appeach the villain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>What is the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Peace, foolish woman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Good mother, be content; it is no more</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Than my poor life must answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Thy life answer!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Servant with boots</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Give me my boots, I say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Why, York, what wilt thou do?</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Have we more sons? or are we like to have?</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And rob me of a happy mother's name?</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Thou fond mad woman,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?</span><br/>
<span id='105'>A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And interchangeably set down their hands,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>To kill the king at Oxford.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>He shall be none;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>I would appeach him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Hadst thou groan'd for him</span><br/>
<span id='113'>As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect</span><br/>
<span id='115'>That I have been disloyal to thy bed,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And that he is a bastard, not thy son:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:</span><br/>
<span id='118'>He is as like thee as a man may be,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Not like to me, or any of my kin,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>And yet I love him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Make way, unruly woman!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Spur post, and get before him to the king,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.</span><br/>
<span id='125'>I'll not be long behind; though I be old,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:</span><br/>
<span id='127'>And never will I rise up from the ground</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

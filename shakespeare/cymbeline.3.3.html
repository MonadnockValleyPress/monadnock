<h1>Cymbeline</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Wales: a mountainous country with a cave.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS; GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS following</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>A goodly day not to keep house, with such</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And keep their impious turbans on, without</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!</span><br/>
<span id='8'>We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly</span><br/>
<span id='9'>As prouder livers do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Hail, heaven!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Hail, heaven!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>When you above perceive me like a crow,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>That it is place which lessens and sets off;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And you may then revolve what tales I have told you</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>This service is not service, so being done,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Draws us a profit from all things we see;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And often, to our comfort, shall we find</span><br/>
<span id='22'>The sharded beetle in a safer hold</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Is nobler than attending for a cheque,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not</span><br/>
<span id='31'>What air's from home. Haply this life is best,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>If quiet life be best; sweeter to you</span><br/>
<span id='33'>That have a sharper known; well corresponding</span><br/>
<span id='34'>With your stiff age: but unto us it is</span><br/>
<span id='35'>A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>A prison for a debtor, that not dares</span><br/>
<span id='37'>To stride a limit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>                  What should we speak of</span><br/>
<span id='39'>When we are old as you? when we shall hear</span><br/>
<span id='40'>The rain and wind beat dark December, how,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse</span><br/>
<span id='42'>The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage</span><br/>
<span id='46'>We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And sing our bondage freely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>How you speak!</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Did you but know the city's usuries</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court</span><br/>
<span id='51'>As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Is certain falling, or so slippery that</span><br/>
<span id='53'>The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>A pain that only seems to seek out danger</span><br/>
<span id='55'>I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'</span><br/>
<span id='56'>the search,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph</span><br/>
<span id='58'>As record of fair act; nay, many times,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Must court'sy at the censure:&mdash;O boys, this story</span><br/>
<span id='61'>The world may read in me: my body's mark'd</span><br/>
<span id='62'>With Roman swords, and my report was once</span><br/>
<span id='63'>First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And when a soldier was the theme, my name</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Was not far off: then was I as a tree</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>A storm or robbery, call it what you will,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And left me bare to weather.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Uncertain favour!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>My fault being nothing&mdash;as I have told you oft&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline</span><br/>
<span id='74'>I was confederate with the Romans: so</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years</span><br/>
<span id='76'>This rock and these demesnes have been my world;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid</span><br/>
<span id='78'>More pious debts to heaven than in all</span><br/>
<span id='79'>The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!</span><br/>
<span id='80'>This is not hunters' language: he that strikes</span><br/>
<span id='81'>The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>To him the other two shall minister;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And we will fear no poison, which attends</span><br/>
<span id='84'>In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS</em></p>
<span id='85'>How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!</span><br/>
<span id='86'>These boys know little they are sons to the king;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>They think they are mine; and though train'd</span><br/>
<span id='89'>up thus meanly</span><br/>
<span id='90'>I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit</span><br/>
<span id='91'>The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them</span><br/>
<span id='92'>In simple and low things to prince it much</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who</span><br/>
<span id='95'>The king his father call'd Guiderius,&mdash;Jove!</span><br/>
<span id='96'>When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell</span><br/>
<span id='97'>The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Into my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then</span><br/>
<span id='100'>The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture</span><br/>
<span id='102'>That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Strikes life into my speech and shows much more</span><br/>
<span id='105'>His own conceiving.&mdash;Hark, the game is roused!</span><br/>
<span id='106'>O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>At three and two years old, I stole these babes;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Thinking to bar thee of succession, as</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for</span><br/>
<span id='112'>their mother,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>And every day do honour to her grave:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>They take for natural father. The game is up.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<h1>Richard II</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Langley. The Duke of York's garden.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the QUEEN and two Ladies</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>What sport shall we devise here in this garden,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>To drive away the heavy thought of care?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Lady</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Madam, we'll play at bowls.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And that my fortune rubs against the bias.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Lady</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Madam, we'll dance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>My legs can keep no measure in delight,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Lady</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Madam, we'll tell tales.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Of sorrow or of joy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Lady</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Of either, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Of neither, girl:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>For of joy, being altogether wanting,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>It doth remember me the more of sorrow;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Or if of grief, being altogether had,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>For what I have I need not to repeat;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And what I want it boots not to complain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Lady</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Madam, I'll sing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>'Tis well that thou hast cause</span><br/>
<span id='22'>But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Lady</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>I could weep, madam, would it do you good.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>And I could sing, would weeping do me good,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And never borrow any tear of thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Gardener, and two Servants</em></p>
<span id='26'>But stay, here come the gardeners:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Let's step into the shadow of these trees.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>My wretchedness unto a row of pins,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>They'll talk of state; for every one doth so</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.</span><br/>
<p><em>QUEEN and Ladies retire</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Gardener</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Which, like unruly children, make their sire</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Give some supportance to the bending twigs.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Go thou, and like an executioner,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>That look too lofty in our commonwealth:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>All must be even in our government.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>You thus employ'd, I will go root away</span><br/>
<span id='40'>The noisome weeds, which without profit suck</span><br/>
<span id='41'>The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Why should we in the compass of a pale</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Keep law and form and due proportion,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Swarming with caterpillars?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Gardener</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Hold thy peace:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>What, are they dead?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Gardener</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>They are; and Bolingbroke</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it</span><br/>
<span id='60'>That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land</span><br/>
<span id='61'>As we this garden! We at time of year</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>With too much riches it confound itself:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Had he done so to great and growing men,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>They might have lived to bear and he to taste</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches</span><br/>
<span id='68'>We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>What, think you then the king shall be deposed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Gardener</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Depress'd he is already, and deposed</span><br/>
<span id='73'>'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night</span><br/>
<span id='74'>To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>That tell black tidings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!</span><br/>
<p><em>Coming forward</em></p>
<span id='77'>Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?</span><br/>
<span id='79'>What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee</span><br/>
<span id='80'>To make a second fall of cursed man?</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Gardener</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Pardon me, madam: little joy have I</span><br/>
<span id='86'>To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.</span><br/>
<span id='87'>King Richard, he is in the mighty hold</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And some few vanities that make him light;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Besides himself, are all the English peers,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Post you to London, and you will find it so;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>I speak no more than every one doth know.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Doth not thy embassage belong to me,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st</span><br/>
<span id='99'>To serve me last, that I may longest keep</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>To meet at London London's king in woe.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>What, was I born to this, that my sad look</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>GARDENER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>I would my skill were subject to thy curse.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Here did she fall a tear; here in this place</span><br/>
<span id='109'>I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>In the remembrance of a weeping queen.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

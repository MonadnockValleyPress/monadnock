<h1>Titus Andronicus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Rome. Titus's garden.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter young LUCIUS, and LAVINIA running after him,  and the boy flies from her, with books under his arm. Then enter TITUS and MARCUS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Young LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Follows me every where, I know not why:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Young LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Fear her not, Lucius: somewhat doth she mean:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Somewhither would she have thee go with her.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Read to her sons than she hath read to thee</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Young LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Extremity of griefs would make men mad;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And I have read that Hecuba of Troy</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Which made me down to throw my books, and fly&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I will most willingly attend your ladyship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Lucius, I will.</span><br/>
<p><em>LAVINIA turns over with her stumps the books which LUCIUS has let fall</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Some book there is that she desires to see.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>But thou art deeper read, and better skill'd</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Come, and take choice of all my library,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>I think she means that there was more than one</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Confederate in the fact: ay, more there was;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Young LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>My mother gave it me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>For love of her that's gone,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!</span><br/>
<p><em>Helping her</em></p>
<span id='47'>What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?</span><br/>
<span id='48'>This is the tragic tale of Philomel,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see!</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>O, had we never, never hunted there!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>By nature made for murders and for rapes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>O, why should nature build so foul a den,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Unless the gods delight in tragedies?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none</span><br/>
<span id='62'>but friends,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Inspire me, that I may this treason find!</span><br/>
<span id='69'>My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst</span><br/>
<span id='71'>This after me, when I have writ my name</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Without the help of any hand at all.</span><br/>
<p><em>He writes his name with his staff, and guides it with feet and mouth</em></p>
<span id='73'>Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Write thou good niece; and here display, at last,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>What God will have discover'd for revenge;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>That we may know the traitors and the truth!</span><br/>
<p><em>She takes the staff in her mouth, and guides it with her stumps, and writes</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?</span><br/>
<span id='79'>'Stuprum. Chiron. Demetrius.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Magni Dominator poli,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>O, calm thee, gentle lord; although I know</span><br/>
<span id='85'>There is enough written upon this earth</span><br/>
<span id='86'>To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And swear with me, as, with the woful fere</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And father of that chaste dishonour'd dame,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>That we will prosecute by good advice</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And see their blood, or die with this reproach.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>'Tis sure enough, an you knew how.</span><br/>
<span id='97'>But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>The dam will wake; and, if she wind you once,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>She's with the lion deeply still in league,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And when he sleeps will she do what she list.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let it alone;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And with a gad of steel will write these words,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And lay it by: the angry northern wind</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Will blow these sands, like Sibyl's leaves, abroad,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And where's your lesson, then? Boy, what say you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Young LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>I say, my lord, that if I were a man,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Their mother's bed-chamber should not be safe</span><br/>
<span id='110'>For these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Ay, that's my boy! thy father hath full oft</span><br/>
<span id='112'>For his ungrateful country done the like.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Young LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Come, go with me into mine armoury;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Shalt carry from me to the empress' sons</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Presents that I intend to send them both:</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Come, come; thou'lt do thy message, wilt thou not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Young LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Ay, marry, will we, sir; and we'll be waited on.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt TITUS, LAVINIA, and Young LUCIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>O heavens, can you hear a good man groan,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And not relent, or not compassion him?</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>But yet so just that he will not revenge.</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Revenge, ye heavens, for old Andronicus!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

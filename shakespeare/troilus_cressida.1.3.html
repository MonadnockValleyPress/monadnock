<h3>Act I, Scene III</H3>
<h4>The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon's tent.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON, NESTOR, ULYSSES, MENELAUS, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>AGAMEMNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Princes,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?</span><br/>
<span id='3'>The ample proposition that hope makes</span><br/>
<span id='4'>In all designs begun on earth below</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Infect the sound pine and divert his grain</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Tortive and errant from his course of growth.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Nor, princes, is it matter new to us</span><br/>
<span id='11'>That we come short of our suppose so far</span><br/>
<span id='12'>That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Sith every action that hath gone before,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Whereof we have record, trial did draw</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And that unbodied figure of the thought</span><br/>
<span id='17'>That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And call them shames? which are indeed nought else</span><br/>
<span id='20'>But the protractive trials of great Jove</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To find persistive constancy in men:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>The fineness of which metal is not found</span><br/>
<span id='23'>In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>The wise and fool, the artist and unread,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Puffing at all, winnows the light away;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And what hath mass or matter, by itself</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>NESTOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>With due observance of thy godlike seat,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>How many shallow bauble boats dare sail</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Upon her patient breast, making their way</span><br/>
<span id='37'>With those of nobler bulk!</span><br/>
<span id='38'>But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage</span><br/>
<span id='39'>The gentle Thetis, and anon behold</span><br/>
<span id='40'>The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Bounding between the two moist elements,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide</span><br/>
<span id='47'>In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage</span><br/>
<span id='52'>As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And with an accent tuned in selfsame key</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Retorts to chiding fortune.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ULYSSES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Agamemnon,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>In whom the tempers and the minds of all</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Besides the applause and approbation To which,</span><br/>
<p><em>To AGAMEMNON</em></p>
<span id='61'>most mighty for thy place and sway,</span><br/>
<p><em>To NESTOR</em></p>
<span id='62'>And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life</span><br/>
<span id='63'>I give to both your speeches, which were such</span><br/>
<span id='64'>As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Should hold up high in brass, and such again</span><br/>
<span id='66'>As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree</span><br/>
<span id='68'>On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears</span><br/>
<span id='69'>To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>AGAMEMNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Speak, prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect</span><br/>
<span id='72'>That matter needless, of importless burden,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Divide thy lips, than we are confident,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>We shall hear music, wit and oracle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ULYSSES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>But for these instances.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>The specialty of rule hath been neglected:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>When that the general is not like the hive</span><br/>
<span id='83'>To whom the foragers shall all repair,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Observe degree, priority and place,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Office and custom, in all line of order;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And therefore is the glorious planet Sol</span><br/>
<span id='91'>In noble eminence enthroned and sphered</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And posts, like the commandment of a king,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets</span><br/>
<span id='96'>In evil mixture to disorder wander,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!</span><br/>
<span id='98'>What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Divert and crack, rend and deracinate</span><br/>
<span id='101'>The unity and married calm of states</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Which is the ladder to all high designs,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>The primogenitive and due of birth,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>But by degree, stand in authentic place?</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Take but degree away, untune that string,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets</span><br/>
<span id='112'>In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And make a sop of all this solid globe:</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Strength should be lord of imbecility,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And the rude son should strike his father dead:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Between whose endless jar justice resides,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Should lose their names, and so should justice too.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Then every thing includes itself in power,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Power into will, will into appetite;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And appetite, an universal wolf,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>So doubly seconded with will and power,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Must make perforce an universal prey,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>This chaos, when degree is suffocate,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Follows the choking.</span><br/>
<span id='128'>And this neglection of degree it is</span><br/>
<span id='129'>That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose</span><br/>
<span id='130'>It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd</span><br/>
<span id='131'>By him one step below, he by the next,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>That next by him beneath; so every step,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Exampled by the first pace that is sick</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Of his superior, grows to an envious fever</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Of pale and bloodless emulation:</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>NESTOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd</span><br/>
<span id='140'>The fever whereof all our power is sick.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>AGAMEMNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>What is the remedy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ULYSSES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns</span><br/>
<span id='144'>The sinew and the forehand of our host,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Having his ear full of his airy fame,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Upon a lazy bed the livelong day</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Breaks scurril jests;</span><br/>
<span id='150'>And with ridiculous and awkward action,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Thy topless deputation he puts on,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>And, like a strutting player, whose conceit</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich</span><br/>
<span id='156'>To hear the wooden dialogue and sound</span><br/>
<span id='157'>'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming</span><br/>
<span id='159'>He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff</span><br/>
<span id='163'>The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>As he being drest to some oration.'</span><br/>
<span id='168'>That's done, as near as the extremest ends</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!</span><br/>
<span id='171'>'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Arming to answer in a night alarm.'</span><br/>
<span id='173'>And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all</span><br/>
<span id='179'>In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Severals and generals of grace exact,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Success or loss, what is or is not, serves</span><br/>
<span id='185'>As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>NESTOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>And in the imitation of these twain&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns</span><br/>
<span id='188'>With an imperial voice&mdash;many are infect.</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head</span><br/>
<span id='190'>In such a rein, in full as proud a place</span><br/>
<span id='191'>As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>To match us in comparisons with dirt,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>To weaken and discredit our exposure,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>How rank soever rounded in with danger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ULYSSES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Count wisdom as no member of the war,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Forestall prescience, and esteem no act</span><br/>
<span id='201'>But that of hand: the still and mental parts,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>That do contrive how many hands shall strike,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>When fitness calls them on, and know by measure</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Of their observant toil the enemies' weight,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:</span><br/>
<span id='206'>They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;</span><br/>
<span id='207'>So that the ram that batters down the wall,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>They place before his hand that made the engine,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Or those that with the fineness of their souls</span><br/>
<span id='211'>By reason guide his execution.</span><br/>

<span id='300'>One noble man that hath one spark of fire,</span><br/>
<span id='301'>To answer for his love, tell him from me</span><br/>
<span id='302'>I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver</span><br/>
<span id='303'>And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,</span><br/>
<span id='304'>And meeting him will tell him that my lady</span><br/>

<span id='320'>What is't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ULYSSES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='321'>This 'tis:</span><br/>
<span id='322'>Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride</span><br/>
<span id='323'>That hath to this maturity blown up</span><br/>
<span id='324'>In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,</span><br/>
<span id='325'>Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,</span><br/>

<span id='328'>This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,</span><br/>
<span id='329'>However it is spread in general name,</span><br/>
<span id='330'>Relates in purpose only to Achilles.</span><br/>

<span id='speech44'><strong>NESTOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='331'>The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,</span><br/>
<span id='332'>Whose grossness little characters sum up:</span><br/>
<span id='333'>And, in the publication, make no strain,</span><br/>
<span id='334'>But that Achilles, were his brain as barren</span><br/>
<span id='335'>As banks of Libya,&mdash;though, Apollo knows,</span><br/>
<span id='336'>'Tis dry enough,&mdash;will, with great speed of judgment,</span><br/>
<span id='337'>Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose</span><br/>
<span id='338'>Pointing on him.</span><br/>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ULYSSES</strong></a>

<span id='speech46'><strong>NESTOR</strong></a>

<span id='340'>Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,</span><br/>
<span id='341'>That can from Hector bring his honour off,</span><br/>
<span id='342'>If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,</span><br/>
<span id='343'>Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;</span><br/>
<span id='344'>For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute</span><br/>
<span id='345'>With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,</span><br/>
<span id='346'>Our imputation shall be oddly poised</span><br/>
<span id='347'>In this wild action; for the success,</span><br/>
<span id='348'>Although particular, shall give a scantling</span><br/>
<span id='349'>Of good or bad unto the general;</span><br/>
<span id='350'>And in such indexes, although small pricks</span><br/>
<span id='351'>To their subsequent volumes, there is seen</span><br/>
<span id='352'>The baby figure of the giant mass</span><br/>
<span id='353'>Of things to come at large. It is supposed</span><br/>
<span id='354'>He that meets Hector issues from our choice</span><br/>
<span id='355'>And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,</span><br/>
<span id='356'>Makes merit her election, and doth boil,</span><br/>
<span id='357'>As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd</span><br/>
<span id='358'>Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,</span><br/>
<span id='359'>What heart receives from hence the conquering part,</span><br/>
<span id='360'>To steel a strong opinion to themselves?</span><br/>
<span id='361'>Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,</span><br/>
<span id='362'>In no less working than are swords and bows</span><br/>
<span id='363'>Directive by the limbs.</span><br/>

<span id='367'>And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,</span><br/>
<span id='368'>The lustre of the better yet to show,</span><br/>
<span id='369'>Shall show the better. Do not consent</span><br/>

<span id='379'>Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,</span><br/>
<span id='380'>Why then, we did our main opinion crush</span><br/>
<span id='381'>In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;</span><br/>
<span id='382'>And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw</span><br/>
<span id='383'>The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves</span><br/>
<span id='384'>Give him allowance for the better man;</span><br/>
<span id='385'>For that will physic the great Myrmidon</span><br/>
<span id='386'>Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall</span><br/>
<span id='387'>His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.</span><br/>
<span id='388'>If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,</span><br/>
<span id='389'>We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,</span><br/>

<span id='391'>That we have better men. But, hit or miss,</span><br/>
<span id='392'>Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:</span><br/>

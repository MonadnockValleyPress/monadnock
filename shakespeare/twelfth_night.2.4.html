<h1>Twelfth Night</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene IV</H3>
<h4>Duke Orsino's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>That old and antique song we heard last night:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Methought it did relieve my passion much,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>More than light airs and recollected terms</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Come, but one verse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Who was it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Seek him out, and play the tune the while.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit CURIO. Music plays</em></p>
<span id='13'>Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>In the sweet pangs of it remember me;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>For such as I am all true lovers are,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Save in the constant image of the creature</span><br/>
<span id='18'>That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>It gives a very echo to the seat</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Where Love is throned.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Thou dost speak masterly:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Hath it not, boy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>                  A little, by your favour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>What kind of woman is't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Of your complexion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>About your years, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Too old by heaven: let still the woman take</span><br/>
<span id='31'>An elder than herself: so wears she to him,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>So sways she level in her husband's heart:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Than women's are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>                  I think it well, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Then let thy love be younger than thyself,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>For women are as roses, whose fair flower</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>And so they are: alas, that they are so;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>To die, even when they to perfection grow!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter CURIO and Clown</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>The spinsters and the knitters in the sun</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And the free maids that weave their thread with bones</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And dallies with the innocence of love,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Like the old age.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Are you ready, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Ay; prithee, sing.</span><br/>
<p><em>Music</em></p>
<span id='53'>SONG.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Come away, come away, death,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And in sad cypress let me be laid;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Fly away, fly away breath;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>I am slain by a fair cruel maid.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>O, prepare it!</span><br/>
<span id='60'>My part of death, no one so true</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Did share it.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Not a flower, not a flower sweet</span><br/>
<span id='63'>On my black coffin let there be strown;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Not a friend, not a friend greet</span><br/>
<span id='65'>My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>A thousand thousand sighs to save,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Lay me, O, where</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Sad true lover never find my grave,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>To weep there!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>There's for thy pains.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>I'll pay thy pleasure then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Give me now leave to leave thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Clown</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Now, the melancholy god protect thee; and the</span><br/>
<span id='76'>tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for</span><br/>
<span id='77'>thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such</span><br/>
<span id='78'>constancy put to sea, that their business might be</span><br/>
<span id='79'>every thing and their intent every where; for that's</span><br/>
<span id='80'>it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Let all the rest give place.</span><br/>
<p><em>CURIO and Attendants retire</em></p>
<span id='82'>Once more, Cesario,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems</span><br/>
<span id='89'>That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>But if she cannot love you, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>I cannot be so answer'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Sooth, but you must.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Hath for your love a great a pang of heart</span><br/>
<span id='95'>As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>There is no woman's sides</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Can bide the beating of so strong a passion</span><br/>
<span id='99'>As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart</span><br/>
<span id='100'>So big, to hold so much; they lack retention</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>No motion of the liver, but the palate,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>But mine is all as hungry as the sea,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And can digest as much: make no compare</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Between that love a woman can bear me</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And that I owe Olivia.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Ay, but I know&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>What dost thou know?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Too well what love women to men may owe:</span><br/>
<span id='111'>In faith, they are as true of heart as we.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>My father had a daughter loved a man,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>I should your lordship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>And what's her history?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>A blank, my lord. She never told her love,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And with a green and yellow melancholy</span><br/>
<span id='120'>She sat like patience on a monument,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?</span><br/>
<span id='122'>We men may say more, swear more: but indeed</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Our shows are more than will; for still we prove</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Much in our vows, but little in our love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>But died thy sister of her love, my boy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>I am all the daughters of my father's house,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Sir, shall I to this lady?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>DUKE ORSINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Ay, that's the theme.</span><br/>
<span id='130'>To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>My love can give no place, bide no denay.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

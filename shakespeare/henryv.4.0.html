<h1>Henry V</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Prologue</h3>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Chorus</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Chorus</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now entertain conjecture of a time</span><br/>
<span id='2'>When creeping murmur and the poring dark</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Fills the wide vessel of the universe.</span><br/>
<span id='4'>From camp to camp through the foul womb of night</span><br/>
<span id='5'>The hum of either army stilly sounds,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>That the fixed sentinels almost receive</span><br/>
<span id='7'>The secret whispers of each other's watch:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The armourers, accomplishing the knights,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>With busy hammers closing rivets up,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Give dreadful note of preparation:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And the third hour of drowsy morning name.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>The confident and over-lusty French</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Do the low-rated English play at dice;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp</span><br/>
<span id='22'>So tediously away. The poor condemned English,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Sit patiently and inly ruminate</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The morning's danger, and their gesture sad</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Presenteth them unto the gazing moon</span><br/>
<span id='28'>So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold</span><br/>
<span id='29'>The royal captain of this ruin'd band</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'</span><br/>
<span id='32'>For forth he goes and visits all his host.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Bids them good morrow with a modest smile</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Upon his royal face there is no note</span><br/>
<span id='36'>How dread an army hath enrounded him;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Unto the weary and all-watched night,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>But freshly looks and over-bears attaint</span><br/>
<span id='40'>With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>That every wretch, pining and pale before,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>A largess universal like the sun</span><br/>
<span id='44'>His liberal eye doth give to every one,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Behold, as may unworthiness define,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>A little touch of Harry in the night.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And so our scene must to the battle fly;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Where&mdash;O for pity!&mdash;we shall much disgrace</span><br/>
<span id='50'>With four or five most vile and ragged foils,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Minding true things by what their mockeries be.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

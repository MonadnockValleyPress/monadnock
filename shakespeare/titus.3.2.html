<h1>Titus Andronicus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>A room in Titus's house. A banquet set out.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter TITUS, MARCUS, LAVINIA and Young LUCIUS, a boy</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>So, so; now sit: and look you eat no more</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Than will preserve just so much strength in us</span><br/>
<span id='3'>As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And cannot passionate our tenfold grief</span><br/>
<span id='7'>With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Then thus I thump it down.</span><br/>
<p><em>To LAVINIA</em></p>
<span id='12'>Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!</span><br/>
<span id='13'>When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Or get some little knife between thy teeth,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And just against thy heart make thou a hole;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall</span><br/>
<span id='19'>May run into that sink, and soaking in</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Fie, brother, fie! teach her not thus to lay</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Such violent hands upon her tender life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>How now! has sorrow made thee dote already?</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>What violent hands can she lay on her life?</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>To bid AEneas tell the tale twice o'er,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?</span><br/>
<span id='29'>O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Lest we remember still that we have none.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>As if we should forget we had no hands,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>If Marcus did not name the word of hands!</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>She says she drinks no other drink but tears,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Brew'd with her sorrow, mesh'd upon her cheeks:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>In thy dumb action will I be as perfect</span><br/>
<span id='41'>As begging hermits in their holy prayers:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>But I of these will wrest an alphabet</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And by still practise learn to know thy meaning.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Young LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And tears will quickly melt thy life away.</span><br/>
<p><em>MARCUS strikes the dish with a knife</em></p>
<span id='52'>What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>At that that I have kill'd, my lord; a fly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Out on thee, murderer! thou kill'st my heart;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>A deed of death done on the innocent</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Becomes not Titus' brother: get thee gone:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>I see thou art not for my company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>But how, if that fly had a father and mother?</span><br/>
<span id='61'>How would he hang his slender gilded wings,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And buzz lamenting doings in the air!</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Poor harmless fly,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>That, with his pretty buzzing melody,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Came here to make us merry! and thou hast</span><br/>
<span id='66'>kill'd him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favor'd fly,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Like to the empress' Moor; therefore I kill'd him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>O, O, O,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Then pardon me for reprehending thee,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>For thou hast done a charitable deed.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Give me thy knife, I will insult on him;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Flattering myself, as if it were the Moor</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Come hither purposely to poison me.&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Ah, sirrah!</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Yet, I think, we are not brought so low,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>But that between us we can kill a fly</span><br/>
<span id='79'>That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>He takes false shadows for true substances.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>I'll to thy closet; and go read with thee</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Sad stories chanced in the times of old.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

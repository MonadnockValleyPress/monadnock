<h4>London. The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and LADY GREY</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field</span><br/>
<span id='2'>This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>His lands then seized on by the conqueror:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Her suit is now to repossess those lands;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Which we in justice cannot well deny,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Because in quarrel of the house of York</span><br/>
<span id='7'>The worthy gentleman did lose his life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>It were dishonour to deny it her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>[Aside to CLARENCE]  Yea, is it so?</span><br/>
<span id='12'>I see the lady hath a thing to grant,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Before the king will grant her humble suit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He knows the game: how true</span><br/>
<span id='15'>he keeps the wind!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>[Aside to CLARENCE]  Silence!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Widow, we will consider of your suit;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And come some other time to know our mind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>May it please your highness to resolve me now;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay, widow? then I'll warrant</span><br/>
<span id='23'>you all your lands,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Fight closer, or, good faith, you'll catch a blow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I fear her not, unless she</span><br/>
<span id='27'>chance to fall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>[Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that! for he'll</span><br/>
<span id='29'>take vantages.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I think he means to beg a</span><br/>
<span id='32'>child of her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>[Aside to CLARENCE]  Nay, whip me then: he'll rather</span><br/>
<span id='34'>give her two.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Three, my most gracious lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>[Aside to CLARENCE]  You shall have four, if you'll</span><br/>
<span id='37'>be ruled by him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay, good leave have you; for</span><br/>
<span id='42'>you will have leave,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch.</span><br/>
<p><em>GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE retire</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>And would you not do much to do them good?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>To do them good, I would sustain some harm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Therefore I came unto your majesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>So shall you bind me to your highness' service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>What you command, that rests in me to do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>But you will take exceptions to my boon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Why, then I will do what your grace commands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>[Aside to CLARENCE]  He plies her hard; and much rain</span><br/>
<span id='59'>wears the marble.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  As red as fire! nay, then</span><br/>
<span id='61'>her wax must melt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>I take my leave with many thousand thanks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>[Aside to CLARENCE]  The match is made; she seals it</span><br/>
<span id='68'>with a curtsy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>But now you partly may perceive my mind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>My mind will never grant what I perceive</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>For by that loss I will not purchase them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.</span><br/>
<span id='87'>But, mighty lord, this merry inclination</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Accords not with the sadness of my suit:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>[Aside to CLARENCE]  The widow likes him not, she</span><br/>
<span id='94'>knits her brows.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He is the bluntest wooer in</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Christendom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>[Aside]  Her looks do argue her replete with modesty;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Her words do show her wit incomparable;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>All her perfections challenge sovereignty:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>One way or other, she is for a king;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And she shall be my love, or else my queen.&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>I am a subject fit to jest withal,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>But far unfit to be a sovereign.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee</span><br/>
<span id='107'>I speak no more than what my soul intends;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>And that is more than I will yield unto:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>I know I am too mean to be your queen,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And yet too good to be your concubine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>LADY GREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>No more than when my daughters call thee mother.</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing</span><br/>
<span id='118'>To be the father unto many sons.</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>[Aside to CLARENCE]  The ghostly father now hath done</span><br/>
<span id='121'>his shrift.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  When he was made a shriver,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>'twas for shift.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>You'll think it strange if I should marry her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>To whom, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>                  Why, Clarence, to myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>That would be ten days' wonder at the least.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>By so much is the wonder in extremes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Nobleman</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>Nobleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:</span><br/>
<span id='137'>And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>To question of his apprehension.</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Ay, Edward will use women honourably.</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>To cross me from the golden time I look for!</span><br/>
<span id='144'>And yet, between my soul's desire and me&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='145'>The lustful Edward's title buried&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:</span><br/>
<span id='149'>A cold premeditation for my purpose!</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Like one that stands upon a promontory,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:</span><br/>
<span id='156'>So do I wish the crown, being so far off;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Flattering me with impossibilities.</span><br/>
<span id='160'>My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Unless my hand and strength could equal them.</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;</span><br/>
<span id='163'>What other pleasure can the world afford?</span><br/>
<span id='164'>I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>And deck my body in gay ornaments,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.</span><br/>
<span id='167'>O miserable thought! and more unlikely</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Why, love forswore me in my  mother's womb:</span><br/>
<span id='170'>And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;</span><br/>
<span id='173'>To make an envious mountain on my back,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Where sits deformity to mock my body;</span><br/>
<span id='175'>To shape my legs of an unequal size;</span><br/>
<span id='176'>To disproportion me in every part,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp</span><br/>
<span id='178'>That carries no impression like the dam.</span><br/>
<span id='179'>And am I then a man to be beloved?</span><br/>
<span id='180'>O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such</span><br/>
<span id='183'>As are of better person than myself,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Be round impaled with a glorious crown.</span><br/>
<span id='188'>And yet I know not how to get the crown,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>For many lives stand between me and home:</span><br/>
<span id='190'>And I,&mdash;like one lost in a thorny wood,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Seeking a way and straying from the way;</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Not knowing how to find the open air,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>But toiling desperately to find it out,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Torment myself to catch the English crown:</span><br/>
<span id='196'>And from that torment I will free myself,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>And frame my face to all occasions.</span><br/>
<span id='202'>I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;</span><br/>
<span id='203'>I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;</span><br/>
<span id='204'>I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.</span><br/>
<span id='207'>I can add colours to the chameleon,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>And set the murderous Machiavel to school.</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

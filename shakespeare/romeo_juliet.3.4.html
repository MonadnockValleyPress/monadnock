<h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>A room in Capulet's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>That we have had no time to move our daughter:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And so did I:&mdash;Well, we were born to die.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>I promise you, but for your company,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>I would have been a-bed an hour ago.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>These times of woe afford no time to woo.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled</span><br/>
<span id='14'>In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>But, soft! what day is this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Monday, my lord,</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>She shall be married to this noble earl.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Will you be ready? do you like this haste?</span><br/>
<span id='24'>We'll keep no great ado,&mdash;a friend or two;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>It may be thought we held him carelessly,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Being our kinsman, if we revel much:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CAPULET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Afore me! it is so very very late,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>That we may call it early by and by.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Good night.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

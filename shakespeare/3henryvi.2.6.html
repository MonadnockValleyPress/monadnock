<h1>Henry VI, Part 3</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene VI</h3>
<h4>Another part of the field.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow</span><br/>
<span id='4'>More than my body's parting with my soul!</span><br/>
<span id='5'>My love and fear glued many friends to thee;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>The common people swarm like summer flies;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And who shines now but Henry's enemies?</span><br/>
<span id='11'>O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent</span><br/>
<span id='12'>That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Or as thy father and his father did,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Giving no ground unto the house of York,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>They never then had sprung like summer flies;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I and ten thousand in this luckless realm</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Had left no mourning widows for our death;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The foe is merciless, and will not pity;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>For at their hands I have deserved no pity.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>The air hath got into my deadly wounds,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast.</span><br/>
<p><em>He faints</em></p>
<p><em>Alarum and retreat. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>EDWARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>That led calm Henry, though he were a king,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Command an argosy to stem the waves.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>No, 'tis impossible he should escape,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>For, though before his face I speak the words</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead.</span><br/>
<p><em>CLIFFORD groans, and dies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>EDWARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>EDWARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>If friend or foe, let him be gently used.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch</span><br/>
<span id='48'>In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>But set his murdering knife unto the root</span><br/>
<span id='50'>From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>I mean our princely father, Duke of York.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>From off the gates of York fetch down the head,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Instead whereof let this supply the room:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Measure for measure must be answered.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>EDWARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>That nothing sung but death to us and ours:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>I think his understanding is bereft.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Because he would avoid such bitter taunts</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Which in the time of death he gave our father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GEORGE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>EDWARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GEORGE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>EDWARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>GEORGE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard</span><br/>
<span id='78'>When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>If this right hand would buy two hour's life,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>That I in all despite might rail at him,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>This hand should chop it off, and with the</span><br/>
<span id='83'>issuing blood</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst</span><br/>
<span id='85'>York and young Rutland could not satisfy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And rear it in the place your father's stands.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And now to London with triumphant march,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>There to be crowned England's royal king:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread</span><br/>
<span id='94'>The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.</span><br/>
<span id='97'>First will I see the coronation;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>EDWARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>And never will I undertake the thing</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>RICHARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Tut, that's a foolish observation:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>To see these honours in possession.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

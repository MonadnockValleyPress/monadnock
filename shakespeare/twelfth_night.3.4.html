<h1>Twelfth Night</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene IV</H3>
<h4>Olivia's garden.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter OLIVIA and MARIA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I have sent after him: he says he'll come;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?</span><br/>
<span id='3'>For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.</span><br/>
<span id='4'>I speak too loud.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Where is Malvolio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He</span><br/>
<span id='9'>is, sure, possessed, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Why, what's the matter? does he rave?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your</span><br/>
<span id='12'>ladyship were best to have some guard about you, if</span><br/>
<span id='13'>he come; for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Go call him hither.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit MARIA</em></p>
<span id='15'>I am as mad as he,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>If sad and merry madness equal be.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter MARIA, with MALVOLIO</em></p>
<span id='17'>How now, Malvolio!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Sweet lady, ho, ho.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Smilest thou?</span><br/>
<span id='20'>I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some</span><br/>
<span id='22'>obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; but</span><br/>
<span id='23'>what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is</span><br/>
<span id='24'>with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, and</span><br/>
<span id='25'>please all.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It</span><br/>
<span id='28'>did come to his hands, and commands shall be</span><br/>
<span id='29'>executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss</span><br/>
<span id='33'>thy hand so oft?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>How do you, Malvolio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>At your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>'Some are born great,'&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Ha!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>'Some achieve greatness,'&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>What sayest thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Heaven restore thee!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>'Remember who commended thy yellow stocking s,'&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Thy yellow stockings!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Cross-gartered!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Am I made?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Why, this is very midsummer madness.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Servant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is</span><br/>
<span id='54'>returned: I could hardly entreat him back: he</span><br/>
<span id='55'>attends your ladyship's pleasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>OLIVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>I'll come to him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Servant</em></p>
<span id='57'>Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's</span><br/>
<span id='58'>my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special</span><br/>
<span id='59'>care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the</span><br/>
<span id='60'>half of my dowry.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with</span><br/>
<span id='63'>the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may</span><br/>
<span id='64'>appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that</span><br/>
<span id='65'>in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put</span><br/>
<span id='68'>thyself into the trick of singularity;' and</span><br/>
<span id='69'>consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad</span><br/>
<span id='70'>face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the</span><br/>
<span id='71'>habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have</span><br/>
<span id='72'>limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me</span><br/>
<span id='73'>thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this</span><br/>
<span id='74'>fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor</span><br/>
<span id='75'>after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing</span><br/>
<span id='76'>adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no</span><br/>
<span id='77'>scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous</span><br/>
<span id='78'>or unsafe circumstance&mdash;What can be said? Nothing</span><br/>
<span id='79'>that can be can come between me and the full</span><br/>
<span id='80'>prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the</span><br/>
<span id='81'>doer of this, and he is to be thanked.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all</span><br/>
<span id='83'>the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion</span><br/>
<span id='84'>himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Here he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir?</span><br/>
<span id='86'>how is't with you, man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go</span><br/>
<span id='88'>off.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not</span><br/>
<span id='90'>I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a</span><br/>
<span id='91'>care of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Ah, ha! does she so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Go to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gently</span><br/>
<span id='94'>with him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how</span><br/>
<span id='95'>is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>consider, he's an enemy to mankind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Do you know what you say?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes</span><br/>
<span id='99'>it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Carry his water to the wise woman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I</span><br/>
<span id='102'>live. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>How now, mistress!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>O Lord!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: do</span><br/>
<span id='106'>you not see you move him? let me alone with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is</span><br/>
<span id='108'>rough, and will not be roughly used.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Sir!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 'tis not for</span><br/>
<span id='112'>gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hang</span><br/>
<span id='113'>him, foul collier!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>My prayers, minx!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>MALVOLIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow</span><br/>
<span id='118'>things: I am not of your element: you shall know</span><br/>
<span id='119'>more hereafter.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Is't possible?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>If this were played upon a stage now, I could</span><br/>
<span id='122'>condemn it as an improbable fiction.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Why, we shall make him mad indeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>MARIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>The house will be the quieter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound. My</span><br/>
<span id='128'>niece is already in the belief that he's mad: we</span><br/>
<span id='129'>may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt</span><br/>
<span id='131'>us to have mercy on him: at which time we will</span><br/>
<span id='132'>bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a</span><br/>
<span id='133'>finder of madmen. But see, but see.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SIR ANDREW</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>More matter for a May morning.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Here's the challenge, read it: warrant there's</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Is't so saucy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Ay, is't, I warrant him: do but read.</span><br/>

<span id='speech73'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Very brief, and to exceeding good sense&mdash;less.</span><br/>

<span id='166'>it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a</span><br/>
<span id='167'>swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood</span><br/>
<span id='168'>more approbation than ever proof itself would have</span><br/>

<span id='171'>Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behavior</span><br/>
<span id='172'>of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good</span><br/>
<span id='173'>capacity and breeding; his employment between his</span><br/>
<span id='174'>lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this</span><br/>
<span id='175'>letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no</span><br/>
<span id='176'>terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a</span><br/>
<span id='177'>clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by</span><br/>
<span id='178'>word of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable report</span><br/>
<span id='179'>of valour; and drive the gentleman, as I know his</span><br/>
<span id='180'>youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous</span><br/>

<span id='221'>I pray you, sir, what is he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech98'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='222'>He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on</span><br/>
<span id='223'>carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private</span><br/>
<span id='224'>brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and</span><br/>
<span id='225'>his incensement at this moment is so implacable,</span><br/>
<span id='226'>that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death</span><br/>
<span id='227'>and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech99'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='228'>I will return again into the house and desire some</span><br/>
<span id='229'>conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard</span><br/>
<span id='230'>of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on</span><br/>
<span id='231'>others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man</span><br/>
<span id='232'>of that quirk.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech100'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='233'>Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a</span><br/>
<span id='234'>very competent injury: therefore, get you on and</span><br/>
<span id='235'>give him his desire. Back you shall not to the</span><br/>
<span id='236'>house, unless you undertake that with me which with</span><br/>
<span id='237'>as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,</span><br/>
<span id='238'>or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you</span><br/>
<span id='239'>must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech101'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='240'>This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me</span><br/>
<span id='241'>this courteous office, as to know of the knight what</span><br/>
<span id='242'>my offence to him is: it is something of my</span><br/>
<span id='243'>negligence, nothing of my purpose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech102'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>

<span id='244'>I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this</span><br/>

<span id='speech104'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>

<span id='247'>I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a</span><br/>

<span id='speech105'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='249'>I beseech you, what manner of man is he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech106'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>

<span id='250'>Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by</span><br/>
<span id='251'>his form, as you are like to find him in the proof</span><br/>
<span id='252'>of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,</span><br/>
<span id='253'>bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly</span><br/>
<span id='254'>have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk</span><br/>
<span id='255'>towards him? I will make your peace with him if I</span><br/>
<span id='256'>can.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech107'><strong>VIOLA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='257'>I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that</span><br/>

<span id='259'>care not who knows so much of my mettle.</span><br/>

<span id='speech108'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='260'>Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a</span><br/>
<span id='261'>firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and</span><br/>
<span id='262'>all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal</span><br/>
<span id='263'>motion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he</span><br/>
<span id='264'>pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they</span><br/>

<span id='speech111'><strong>SIR ANDREW</strong></a>

<p><em>To FABIAN</em></p>
<span id='276'>I have his horse to take up the quarrel:</span><br/>

<span id='speech113'><strong>FABIAN</strong></a>

<span id='278'>He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and</span><br/>

<span id='speech114'><strong>SIR TOBY BELCH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='280'>[To VIOLA]  There's no remedy, sir; he will fight</span><br/>

<span id='282'>bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now</span><br/>
<span id='283'>scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw, for</span><br/>

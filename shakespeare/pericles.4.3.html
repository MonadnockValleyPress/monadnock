<h1>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Tarsus. A room in Cleon's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CLEON and DIONYZA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DIONYZA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CLEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter</span><br/>
<span id='3'>The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DIONYZA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>I think</span><br/>
<span id='5'>You'll turn a child again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CLEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>I'ld give it to undo the deed. O lady,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess</span><br/>
<span id='9'>To equal any single crown o' the earth</span><br/>
<span id='10'>I' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Whom thou hast poison'd too:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Becoming well thy fact: what canst thou say</span><br/>
<span id='14'>When noble Pericles shall demand his child?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DIONYZA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>To foster it, nor ever to preserve.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Unless you play the pious innocent,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And for an honest attribute cry out</span><br/>
<span id='20'>'She died by foul play.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CLEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>O, go to. Well, well,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Do like this worst.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DIONYZA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Be one of those that think</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And open this to Pericles. I do shame</span><br/>
<span id='27'>To think of what a noble strain you are,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And of how coward a spirit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CLEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>To such proceeding</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Who ever but his approbation added,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Though not his prime consent, he did not flow</span><br/>
<span id='32'>From honourable sources.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DIONYZA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Be it so, then:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>She did disdain my child, and stood between</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>But cast their gazes on Marina's face;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And though you call my course unnatural,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>You not your child well loving, yet I find</span><br/>
<span id='43'>It greets me as an enterprise of kindness</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Perform'd to your sole daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CLEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Heavens forgive it!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DIONYZA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>And as for Pericles,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>What should he say? We wept after her hearse,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And yet we mourn: her monument</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs</span><br/>
<span id='50'>In glittering golden characters express</span><br/>
<span id='51'>A general praise to her, and care in us</span><br/>
<span id='52'>At whose expense 'tis done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CLEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Thou art like the harpy,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Seize with thine eagle's talons.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DIONYZA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>You are like one that superstitiously</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>But yet I know you'll do as I advise.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

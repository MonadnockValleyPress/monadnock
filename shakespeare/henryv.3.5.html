<h1>Henry V</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene V</h3>
<h4>The same.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the KING OF FRANCE, the DAUPHIN, the DUKE oF BOURBON, the Constable of France, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>'Tis certain he hath pass'd the river Somme.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>And if he be not fought withal, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Let us not live in France; let us quit all</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>O Dieu vivant! shall a few sprays of us,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>The emptying of our fathers' luxury,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And overlook their grafters?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BOURBON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Mort de ma vie! if they march along</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>To buy a slobbery and a dirty farm</span><br/>
<span id='14'>In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Dieu de batailles! where have they this mettle?</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Is not their climate foggy, raw and dull,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Seem frosty? O, for honour of our land,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Let us not hang like roping icicles</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Poor we may call them in their native lords.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>By faith and honour,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Our madams mock at us, and plainly say</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Our mettle is bred out and they will give</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Their bodies to the lust of English youth</span><br/>
<span id='31'>To new-store France with bastard warriors.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BOURBON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>They bid us to the English dancing-schools,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Saying our grace is only in our heels,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And that we are most lofty runaways.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Where is Montjoy the herald? speed him hence:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Up, princes! and, with spirit of honour edged</span><br/>
<span id='39'>More sharper than your swords, hie to the field:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Charles Delabreth, high constable of France;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>You Dukes of Orleans, Bourbon, and of Berri,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Alencon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Jaques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Beaumont, Grandpre, Roussi, and Fauconberg,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>High dukes, great princes, barons, lords and knights,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>For your great seats now quit you of great shames.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land</span><br/>
<span id='49'>With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur:</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Go down upon him, you have power enough,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And in a captive chariot into Rouen</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Bring him our prisoner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Constable</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>This becomes the great.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Sorry am I his numbers are so few,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>For I am sure, when he shall see our army,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And for achievement offer us his ransom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Therefore, lord constable, haste on Montjoy.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And let him say to England that we send</span><br/>
<span id='64'>To know what willing ransom he will give.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DAUPHIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Not so, I do beseech your majesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Be patient, for you shall remain with us.</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Now forth, lord constable and princes all,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And quickly bring us word of England's fall.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Timon of Athens</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Before the walls of Athens.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Trumpets sound. Enter ALCIBIADES with his powers</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Sound to this coward and lascivious town</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Our terrible approach.</span><br/>
<p><em>A parley sounded</em></p>
<p><em>Enter Senators on the walls</em></p>
<span id='3'>Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time</span><br/>
<span id='4'>With all licentious measure, making your wills</span><br/>
<span id='5'>The scope of justice; till now myself and such</span><br/>
<span id='6'>As slept within the shadow of your power</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Hav e wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>When crouching marrow in the bearer strong</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Cries of itself 'No more:' now breathless wrong</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And pursy insolence shall break his wind</span><br/>
<span id='13'>With fear and horrid flight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Noble and young,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>To wipe out our ingratitude with loves</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Above their quantity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>Second Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>So did we woo</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Transformed Timon to our city's love</span><br/>
<span id='22'>By humble message and by promised means:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>We were not all unkind, nor all deserve</span><br/>
<span id='24'>The common stroke of war.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>These walls of ours</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Were not erected by their hands from whom</span><br/>
<span id='27'>You have received your griefs; nor are they such</span><br/>
<span id='28'>That these great towers, trophies and schools</span><br/>
<span id='29'>should fall</span><br/>
<span id='30'>For private faults in them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Second Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Nor are they living</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Who were the motives that you first went out;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Into our city with thy banners spread:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>By decimation, and a tithed death&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>If thy revenges hunger for that food</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Which nature loathes&mdash;take thou the destined tenth,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And by the hazard of the spotted die</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Let die the spotted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>All have not offended;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>For those that were, it is not square to take</span><br/>
<span id='43'>On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall</span><br/>
<span id='48'>With those that have offended: like a shepherd,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>But kill not all together.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Second Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>What thou wilt,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Than hew to't with thy sword.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>First Senator </strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Set but thy foot</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>To say thou'lt enter friendly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Second Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Throw thy glove,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Or any token of thine honour else,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And not as our confusion, all thy powers</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Shall make their harbour in our town, till we</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Have seal'd thy full desire.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Then there's my glove;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Descend, and open your uncharged ports:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Those enemies of Timon's and mine own</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Fall and no more: and, to atone your fears</span><br/>
<span id='69'>With my more noble meaning, not a man</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Of regular justice in your city's bounds,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>But shall be render'd to your public laws</span><br/>
<span id='73'>At heaviest answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Both</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>'Tis most nobly spoken.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Descend, and keep your words.</span><br/>
<p><em>The Senators descend, and open the gates</em></p>
<p><em>Enter Soldier</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>My noble general, Timon is dead;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which</span><br/>
<span id='79'>With wax I brought away, whose soft impression</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Interprets for my poor ignorance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>[Reads the epitaph]  'Here lies a</span><br/>
<span id='82'>wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked</span><br/>
<span id='84'>caitiffs left!</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay</span><br/>
<span id='87'>not here thy gait.'</span><br/>
<span id='88'>These well express in thee thy latter spirits:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our</span><br/>
<span id='91'>droplets which</span><br/>
<span id='92'>From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye</span><br/>
<span id='94'>On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Is noble Timon: of whose memory</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And I will use the olive with my sword,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Prescribe to other as each other's leech.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Let our drums strike.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

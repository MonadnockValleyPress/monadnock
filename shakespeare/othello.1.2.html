<h1>Othello</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Another street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Though in the trade of war I have slain men,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience</span><br/>
<span id='3'>To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>'Tis better as it is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Nay, but he prated,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Against your honour</span><br/>
<span id='10'>That, with the little godliness I have,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Are you fast married? Be assured of this,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>That the magnifico is much beloved,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And hath in his effect a voice potential</span><br/>
<span id='15'>As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Or put upon you what restraint and grievance</span><br/>
<span id='17'>The law, with all his might to enforce it on,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Will give him cable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Let him do his spite:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>My services which I have done the signiory</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>I shall promulgate&mdash;I fetch my life and being</span><br/>
<span id='24'>From men of royal siege, and my demerits</span><br/>
<span id='25'>May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune</span><br/>
<span id='26'>As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>But that I love the gentle Desdemona,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I would not my unhoused free condition</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Put into circumscription and confine</span><br/>
<span id='30'>For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Those are the raised father and his friends:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>You were best go in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Not I. I must be found:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>My parts, my title and my perfect soul</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>By Janus, I think no.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>The goodness of the night upon you, friends!</span><br/>
<span id='39'>What is the news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>                  The duke does greet you, general,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Even on the instant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>What is the matter, think you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Something from Cyprus as I may divine:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>It is a business of some heat: the galleys</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Have sent a dozen sequent messengers</span><br/>
<span id='47'>This very night at one another's heels,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And many of the consuls, raised and met,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Are at the duke's already: you have been</span><br/>
<span id='50'>hotly call'd for;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>When, being not at your lodging to be found,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The senate hath sent about three several guests</span><br/>
<span id='53'>To search you out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>'Tis well I am found by you.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>I will but spend a word here in the house,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And go with you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>                  Ancient, what makes he here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>I do not understand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>He's married.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>To who?</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter OTHELLO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Marry, to&mdash;Come, captain, will you go?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Have with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Here comes another troop to seek for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>It is Brabantio. General, be advised;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>He comes to bad intent.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with torches and weapons</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Holla! stand there!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Signior, it is the Moor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Down with him, thief!</span><br/>
<p><em>They draw on both sides</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Good signior, you shall more command with years</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Than with your weapons.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>For I'll refer me to all things of sense,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>If she in chains of magic were not bound,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>So opposite to marriage that she shunned</span><br/>
<span id='81'>The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Would ever have, to incur a general mock,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense</span><br/>
<span id='86'>That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals</span><br/>
<span id='88'>That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>I therefore apprehend and do attach thee</span><br/>
<span id='91'>For an abuser of the world, a practiser</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Subdue him at his peril.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Hold your hands,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Both you of my inclining, and the rest:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Without a prompter. Where will you that I go</span><br/>
<span id='99'>To answer this your charge?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>To prison, till fit time</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Of law and course of direct session</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Call thee to answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>What if I do obey?</span><br/>
<span id='104'>How may the duke be therewith satisfied,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Whose messengers are here about my side,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Upon some present business of the state</span><br/>
<span id='107'>To bring me to him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>First Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>'Tis true, most worthy signior;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>The duke's in council and your noble self,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>I am sure, is sent for.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>How! the duke in council!</span><br/>
<span id='112'>In this time of the night! Bring him away:</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Or any of my brothers of the state,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>For if such actions may have passage free,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Henry VI, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>The Abbey at Bury St. Edmund's.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN  MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, YORK, BUCKINGHAM, SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Can you not see? or will ye not observe</span><br/>
<span id='5'>The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?</span><br/>
<span id='6'>With what a majesty he bears himself,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>How insolent of late he is become,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?</span><br/>
<span id='9'>We know the time since he was mild and affable,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And if we did but glance a far-off look,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Immediately he was upon his knee,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>That all the court admired him for submission:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>When every one will give the time of day,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Disdaining duty that to us belongs.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Small curs are not regarded when they grin;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>But great men tremble when the lion roars;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And Humphrey is no little man in England.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>First note that he is near you in descent,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And should you fall, he as the next will mount.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Me seemeth then it is no policy,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And his advantage following your decease,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>That he should come about your royal person</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Or be admitted to your highness' council.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And when he please to make commotion,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>The reverent care I bear unto my lord</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Made me collect these dangers in the duke.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>If it be fond, call it a woman's fear;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Which fear if better reasons can supplant,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Reprove my allegation, if you can;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Or else conclude my words effectual.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Well hath your highness seen into this duke;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And, had I first been put to speak my mind,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>I think I should have told your grace's tale.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>The duchess, by his subornation,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Upon my life, began her devilish practises:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Or, if he were not privy to those faults,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Yet, by reputing of his high descent,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>As next the king he was successive heir,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And such high vaunts of his nobility,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess</span><br/>
<span id='52'>By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And in his simple show he harbours treason.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>No, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a man</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Did he not, contrary to form of law,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Devise strange deaths for small offences done?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>And did he not, in his protectorship,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Levy great sums of money through the realm</span><br/>
<span id='62'>For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?</span><br/>
<span id='63'>By means whereof the towns each day revolted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Which time will bring to light in smooth</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Duke Humphrey.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>My lords, at once: the care you have of us,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent</span><br/>
<span id='71'>From meaning treason to our royal person</span><br/>
<span id='72'>As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given</span><br/>
<span id='74'>To dream on evil or to work my downfall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>For he's disposed as the hateful raven:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SOMERSET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>All health unto my gracious sovereign!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>That all your interest in those territories</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Is utterly bereft you; all is lost.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Cold news, Lord Somerset: but God's will be done!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>[Aside]  Cold news for me; for I had hope of France</span><br/>
<span id='89'>As firmly as I hope for fertile England.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And caterpillars eat my leaves away;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>But I will remedy this gear ere long,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Or sell my title for a glorious grave.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GLOUCESTER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>All happiness unto my lord the king!</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>I do arrest thee of high treason here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Nor change my countenance for this arrest:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>The purest spring is not so free from mud</span><br/>
<span id='103'>As I am clear from treason to my sovereign:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And, being protector, stayed the soldiers' pay;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>By means whereof his highness hath lost France.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Is it but thought so? what are they that think it?</span><br/>
<span id='109'>I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>So help me God, as I have watch'd the night,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Ay, night by night, in studying good for England,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>That doit that e'er I wrested from the king,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Or any groat I hoarded to my use,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Be brought against me at my trial-day!</span><br/>
<span id='116'>No; many a pound of mine own proper store,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Because I would not tax the needy commons,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Have I disbursed to the garrisons,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And never ask'd for restitution.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>I say no more than truth, so help me God!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>In your protectorship you did devise</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Strange tortures for offenders never heard of,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>That England was defamed by tyranny.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was</span><br/>
<span id='126'>protector,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Pity was all the fault that was in me;</span><br/>
<span id='128'>For I should melt at an offender's tears,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And lowly words were ransom for their fault.</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Unless it were a bloody murderer,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>I never gave them condign punishment:</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Above the felon or what trespass else.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered:</span><br/>
<span id='136'>But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.</span><br/>
<span id='138'>I do arrest you in his highness' name;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>And here commit you to my lord cardinal</span><br/>
<span id='140'>To keep, until your further time of trial.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope</span><br/>
<span id='142'>That you will clear yourself from all suspect:</span><br/>
<span id='143'>My conscience tells me you are innocent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Virtue is choked with foul ambition</span><br/>
<span id='146'>And charity chased hence by rancour's hand;</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Foul subornation is predominant</span><br/>
<span id='148'>And equity exiled your highness' land.</span><br/>
<span id='149'>I know their complot is to have my life,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>And if my death might make this island happy,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>And prove the period of their tyranny,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>I would expend it with all willingness:</span><br/>
<span id='153'>But mine is made the prologue to their play;</span><br/>
<span id='154'>For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue</span><br/>
<span id='159'>The envious load that lies upon his heart;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>By false accuse doth level at my life:</span><br/>
<span id='163'>And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up</span><br/>
<span id='166'>My liefest liege to be mine enemy:</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Ay, all you have laid your heads together&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Myself had notice of your conventicles&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>And all to make away my guiltless life.</span><br/>
<span id='170'>I shall not want false witness to condemn me,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>The ancient proverb will be well effected:</span><br/>
<span id='173'>'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>My liege, his railing is intolerable:</span><br/>
<span id='175'>If those that care to keep your royal person</span><br/>
<span id='176'>From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Be thus upbraided, chid and rated at,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>And the offender granted scope of speech,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here</span><br/>
<span id='181'>With ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>As if she had suborned some to swear</span><br/>
<span id='183'>False allegations to o'erthrow his state?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>But I can give the loser leave to chide.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>Far truer spoke than meant: I lose, indeed;</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false!</span><br/>
<span id='187'>And well such losers may have leave to speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day:</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Lord cardinal, he is your prisoner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Before his legs be firm to bear his body.</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Ah, that my fear were false! ah, that it were!</span><br/>
<span id='196'>For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit, guarded</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Do or undo, as if ourself were here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>What, will your highness leave the parliament?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>My body round engirt with misery,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>For what's more miserable than discontent?</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see</span><br/>
<span id='205'>The map of honour, truth and loyalty:</span><br/>
<span id='206'>And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come</span><br/>
<span id='207'>That e'er I proved thee false or fear'd thy faith.</span><br/>
<span id='208'>What louring star now envies thy estate,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>That these great lords and Margaret our queen</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;</span><br/>
<span id='212'>And as the butcher takes away the calf</span><br/>
<span id='213'>And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;</span><br/>
<span id='216'>And as the dam runs lowing up and down,</span><br/>
<span id='217'>Looking the way her harmless young one went,</span><br/>
<span id='218'>And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case</span><br/>
<span id='220'>With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes</span><br/>
<span id='221'>Look after him and cannot do him good,</span><br/>
<span id='222'>So mighty are his vowed enemies.</span><br/>
<span id='223'>His fortunes I will weep; and, 'twixt each groan</span><br/>
<span id='224'>Say 'Who's a traitor? Gloucester he is none.'</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, and YORK; SOMERSET remains apart</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='225'>Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams.</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,</span><br/>
<span id='227'>Too full of foolish pity, and Gloucester's show</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile</span><br/>
<span id='229'>With sorrow snares relenting passengers,</span><br/>
<span id='230'>Or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank,</span><br/>
<span id='231'>With shining chequer'd slough, doth sting a child</span><br/>
<span id='232'>That for the beauty thinks it excellent.</span><br/>
<span id='233'>Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='234'>And yet herein I judge mine own wit good&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='235'>This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,</span><br/>
<span id='236'>To rid us of the fear we have of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='237'>That he should die is worthy policy;</span><br/>
<span id='238'>But yet we want a colour for his death:</span><br/>
<span id='239'>'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='240'>But, in my mind, that were no policy:</span><br/>
<span id='241'>The king will labour still to save his life,</span><br/>
<span id='242'>The commons haply rise, to save his life;</span><br/>
<span id='243'>And yet we have but trivial argument,</span><br/>
<span id='244'>More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='245'>So that, by this, you would not have him die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='246'>Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='247'>'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.</span><br/>
<span id='248'>But, my lord cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,</span><br/>
<span id='249'>Say as you think, and speak it from your souls,</span><br/>
<span id='250'>Were't not all one, an empty eagle were set</span><br/>
<span id='251'>To guard the chicken from a hungry kite,</span><br/>
<span id='252'>As place Duke Humphrey for the king's protector?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='253'>So the poor chicken should be sure of death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='254'>Madam, 'tis true; and were't not madness, then,</span><br/>
<span id='255'>To make the fox surveyor of the fold?</span><br/>
<span id='256'>Who being accused a crafty murderer,</span><br/>
<span id='257'>His guilt should be but idly posted over,</span><br/>
<span id='258'>Because his purpose is not executed.</span><br/>
<span id='259'>No; let him die, in that he is a fox,</span><br/>
<span id='260'>By nature proved an enemy to the flock,</span><br/>
<span id='261'>Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,</span><br/>
<span id='262'>As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege.</span><br/>
<span id='263'>And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:</span><br/>
<span id='264'>Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,</span><br/>
<span id='265'>Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,</span><br/>
<span id='266'>So he be dead; for that is good deceit</span><br/>
<span id='267'>Which mates him first that first intends deceit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='268'>Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='269'>Not resolute, except so much were done;</span><br/>
<span id='270'>For things are often spoke and seldom meant:</span><br/>
<span id='271'>But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='272'>Seeing the deed is meritorious,</span><br/>
<span id='273'>And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,</span><br/>
<span id='274'>Say but the word, and I will be his priest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CARDINAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='275'>But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,</span><br/>
<span id='276'>Ere you can take due orders for a priest:</span><br/>
<span id='277'>Say you consent and censure well the deed,</span><br/>
<span id='278'>And I'll provide his executioner,</span><br/>
<span id='279'>I tender so the safety of my liege.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>

<span id='333'>Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,</span><br/>

<span id='335'>Be that thou hopest to be, or what thou art</span><br/>
<span id='336'>Resign to death; it is not worth the enjoying:</span><br/>
<span id='337'>Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,</span><br/>
<span id='338'>And find no harbour in a royal heart.</span><br/>
<span id='339'>Faster than spring-time showers comes thought</span><br/>
<span id='340'>on thought,</span><br/>
<span id='341'>And not a thought but thinks on dignity.</span><br/>
<span id='342'>My brain more busy than the labouring spider</span><br/>
<span id='343'>Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.</span><br/>
<span id='344'>Well, nobles, well, 'tis politicly done,</span><br/>
<span id='345'>To send me packing with an host of men:</span><br/>
<span id='346'>I fear me you but warm the starved snake,</span><br/>
<span id='347'>Who, cherish'd in your breasts, will sting</span><br/>
<span id='348'>your hearts.</span><br/>
<span id='349'>'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me:</span><br/>
<span id='350'>I take it kindly; and yet be well assured</span><br/>
<span id='351'>You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.</span><br/>
<span id='352'>Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,</span><br/>
<span id='353'>I will stir up in England some black storm</span><br/>
<span id='354'>Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;</span><br/>
<span id='355'>And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage</span><br/>
<span id='356'>Until the golden circuit on my head,</span><br/>
<span id='357'>Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,</span><br/>
<span id='358'>Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.</span><br/>
<span id='359'>And, for a minister of my intent,</span><br/>
<span id='360'>I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,</span><br/>
<span id='361'>John Cade of Ashford,</span><br/>
<span id='362'>To make commotion, as full well he can,</span><br/>
<span id='363'>Under the title of John Mortimer.</span><br/>
<span id='364'>In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade</span><br/>
<span id='365'>Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,</span><br/>
<span id='366'>And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts</span><br/>
<span id='367'>Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine;</span><br/>
<span id='368'>And, in the end being rescued, I have seen</span><br/>
<span id='369'>Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,</span><br/>
<span id='370'>Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.</span><br/>
<span id='371'>Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,</span><br/>
<span id='372'>Hath he conversed with the enemy,</span><br/>
<span id='373'>And undiscover'd come to me again</span><br/>
<span id='374'>And given me notice of their villanies.</span><br/>
<span id='375'>This devil here shall be my substitute;</span><br/>
<span id='376'>For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,</span><br/>
<span id='377'>In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:</span><br/>
<span id='378'>By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,</span><br/>
<span id='379'>How they affect the house and claim of York.</span><br/>
<span id='380'>Say he be taken, rack'd and tortured,</span><br/>
<span id='381'>I know no pain they can inflict upon him</span><br/>
<span id='382'>Will make him say I moved him to those arms.</span><br/>
<span id='383'>Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,</span><br/>
<span id='384'>Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength</span><br/>
<span id='385'>And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;</span><br/>
<span id='386'>For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,</span><br/>
<span id='387'>And Henry put apart, the next for me.</span><br/>

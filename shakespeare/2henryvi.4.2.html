<h4>Blackheath.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GEORGE BEVIS and JOHN HOLLAND</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BEVIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Come, and get thee a sword, though made of a lath;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>they have been up these two days.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>HOLLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>They have the more need to sleep now, then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>BEVIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress</span><br/>
<span id='5'>the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HOLLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>So he had need, for 'tis threadbare. Well, I say it</span><br/>
<span id='7'>was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BEVIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>HOLLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BEVIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Nay, more, the king's council are no good workmen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HOLLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>True; and yet it is said, labour in thy vocation;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>which is as much to say as, let the magistrates be</span><br/>
<span id='13'>labouring men; and therefore should we be</span><br/>
<span id='14'>magistrates.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BEVIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a</span><br/>
<span id='16'>brave mind than a hard hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HOLLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>I see them! I see them! there's Best's son, the</span><br/>
<span id='18'>tanner of Wingham,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BEVIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>He shall have the skin of our enemies, to make</span><br/>
<span id='20'>dog's-leather of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>HOLLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>And Dick the Butcher,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BEVIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Then is sin struck down like an ox, and iniquity's</span><br/>
<span id='23'>throat cut like a calf.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HOLLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>And Smith the weaver,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BEVIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Argo, their thread of life is spun.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HOLLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Come, come, let's fall in with them.</span><br/>
<p><em>Drum. Enter CADE, DICK the Butcher, SMITH the Weaver, and a Sawyer, with infinite numbers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>We John Cade, so termed of our supposed father,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>[Aside]  Or rather, of stealing a cade of herrings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>For our enemies shall fall before us, inspired with</span><br/>
<span id='30'>the spirit of putting down kings and princes,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>&mdash;Command silence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Silence!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>My father was a Mortimer,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>[Aside]  He was an honest man, and a good</span><br/>
<span id='35'>bricklayer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>My mother a Plantagenet,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>[Aside]  I knew her well; she was a midwife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>My wife descended of the Lacies,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>[Aside]  She was, indeed, a pedler's daughter, and</span><br/>
<span id='40'>sold many laces.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>SMITH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>[Aside]  But now of late, notable to travel with her</span><br/>
<span id='42'>furred pack, she washes bucks here at home.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Therefore am I of an honourable house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>[Aside]  Ay, by my faith, the field is honourable;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>and there was he borne, under a hedge, for his</span><br/>
<span id='46'>father had never a house but the cage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Valiant I am.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>SMITH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>[Aside]  A' must needs; for beggary is valiant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>I am able to endure much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>[Aside]  No question of that; for I have seen him</span><br/>
<span id='51'>whipped three market-days together.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>I fear neither sword nor fire.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>SMITH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>[Aside]  He need not fear the sword; for his coat is of proof.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>[Aside]  But methinks he should stand in fear of</span><br/>
<span id='55'>fire, being burnt i' the hand for stealing of sheep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Be brave, then; for your captain is brave, and vows</span><br/>
<span id='57'>reformation. There shall be in England seven</span><br/>
<span id='58'>halfpenny loaves sold for a penny: the three-hooped</span><br/>
<span id='59'>pot; shall have ten hoops and I will make it felony</span><br/>
<span id='60'>to drink small beer: all the realm shall be in</span><br/>
<span id='61'>common; and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to</span><br/>
<span id='62'>grass: and when I am king, as king I will be,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>ALL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>God save your majesty!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>I thank you, good people: there shall be no money;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>all shall eat and drink on my score; and I will</span><br/>
<span id='66'>apparel them all in one livery, that they may agree</span><br/>
<span id='67'>like brothers and worship me their lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable</span><br/>
<span id='70'>thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should</span><br/>
<span id='71'>be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled</span><br/>
<span id='72'>o'er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>but I say, 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but seal</span><br/>
<span id='74'>once to a thing, and I was never mine own man</span><br/>
<span id='75'>since. How now! who's there?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter some, bringing forward the Clerk of Chatham</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>SMITH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>The clerk of Chatham: he can write and read and</span><br/>
<span id='77'>cast accompt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>O monstrous!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>SMITH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>We took him setting of boys' copies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Here's a villain!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>SMITH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Nay, then, he is a conjurer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Nay, he can make obligations, and write court-hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>I am sorry for't: the man is a proper man, of mine</span><br/>
<span id='85'>honour; unless I find him guilty, he shall not die.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Come hither, sirrah, I must examine thee: what is thy name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>Clerk</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Emmanuel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>They use to write it on the top of letters: 'twill</span><br/>
<span id='89'>go hard with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Let me alone. Dost thou use to write thy name? or</span><br/>
<span id='91'>hast thou a mark to thyself, like an honest</span><br/>
<span id='92'>plain-dealing man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>CLERK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Sir, I thank God, I have been so well brought up</span><br/>
<span id='94'>that I can write my name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>ALL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>He hath confessed: away with him! he's a villain</span><br/>
<span id='96'>and a traitor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Away with him, I say! hang him with his pen and</span><br/>
<span id='98'>ink-horn about his neck.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit one with the Clerk</em></p>
<p><em>Enter MICHAEL</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>MICHAEL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Where's our general?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Here I am, thou particular fellow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>MICHAEL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Fly, fly, fly! Sir Humphrey Stafford and his</span><br/>
<span id='102'>brother are hard by, with the king's forces.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Stand, villain, stand, or I'll fell thee down. He</span><br/>
<span id='104'>shall be encountered with a man as good as himself:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>he is but a knight, is a'?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>MICHAEL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>No.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>To equal him, I will make myself a knight presently.</span><br/>
<p><em>Kneels</em></p>
<span id='108'>Rise up Sir John Mortimer.</span><br/>
<p><em>Rises</em></p>
<span id='109'>Now have at him!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SIR HUMPHREY and WILLIAM STAFFORD, with drum and soldiers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>SIR HUMPHREY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Mark'd for the gallows, lay your weapons down;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Home to your cottages, forsake this groom:</span><br/>
<span id='113'>The king is merciful, if you revolt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>WILLIAM STAFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>But angry, wrathful, and inclined to blood,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>If you go forward; therefore yield, or die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass not:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>It is to you, good people, that I speak,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Over whom, in time to come, I hope to reign;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>For I am rightful heir unto the crown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>SIR HUMPHREY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Villain, thy father was a plasterer;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>And Adam was a gardener.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>WILLIAM STAFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>And what of that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March.</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Married the Duke of Clarence' daughter, did he not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>SIR HUMPHREY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Ay, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>By her he had two children at one birth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>WILLIAM STAFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>That's false.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Ay, there's the question; but I say, 'tis true:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>The elder of them, being put to nurse,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Was by a beggar-woman stolen away;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Became a bricklayer when he came to age:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>His son am I; deny it, if you can.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Nay, 'tis too true; therefore he shall be king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>SMITH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, and</span><br/>
<span id='137'>the bricks are alive at this day to testify it;</span><br/>
<span id='138'>therefore deny it not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>SIR HUMPHREY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>And will you credit this base drudge's words,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>That speaks he knows not what?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>ALL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>WILLIAM STAFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>[Aside]  He lies, for I invented it myself.</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Go to, sirrah, tell the king from me, that, for his</span><br/>
<span id='145'>father's sake, Henry the Fifth, in whose time boys</span><br/>
<span id='146'>went to span-counter for French crowns, I am content</span><br/>
<span id='147'>he shall reign; but I'll be protector over him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>And furthermore, well have the Lord Say's head for</span><br/>
<span id='149'>selling the dukedom of Maine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>And good reason; for thereby is England mained, and</span><br/>
<span id='151'>fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance holds</span><br/>
<span id='152'>it up. Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Say</span><br/>
<span id='153'>hath gelded the commonwealth, and made it an eunuch:</span><br/>
<span id='154'>and more than that, he can speak French; and</span><br/>
<span id='155'>therefore he is a traitor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>SIR HUMPHREY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>O gross and miserable ignorance!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Nay, answer, if you can: the Frenchmen are our</span><br/>
<span id='158'>enemies; go to, then, I ask but this: can he that</span><br/>
<span id='159'>speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good</span><br/>
<span id='160'>counsellor, or no?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>ALL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>No, no; and therefore we'll have his head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>WILLIAM STAFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Assail them with the army of the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>SIR HUMPHREY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Herald, away; and throughout every town</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>That those which fly before the battle ends</span><br/>
<span id='167'>May, even in their wives' and children's sight,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Be hang'd up for example at their doors:</span><br/>
<span id='169'>And you that be the king's friends, follow me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt WILLIAM STAFFORD and SIR HUMPHREY, and soldiers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>And you that love the commons, follow me.</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Now show yourselves men; 'tis for liberty.</span><br/>
<span id='172'>We will not leave one lord, one gentleman:</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>For they are thrifty honest men, and such</span><br/>
<span id='175'>As would, but that they dare not, take our parts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>DICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>They are all in order and march toward us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>But then are we in order when we are most</span><br/>
<span id='178'>out of order. Come, march forward.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>As You Like It</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Before Oliver's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Who's there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ADAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>What, my young master? O, my gentle master!</span><br/>
<span id='3'>O my sweet master! O you memory</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Why would you be so fond to overcome</span><br/>
<span id='8'>The bonny priser of the humorous duke?</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Know you not, master, to some kind of men</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Their graces serve them but as enemies?</span><br/>
<span id='12'>No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>O, what a world is this, when what is comely</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Envenoms him that bears it!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Why, what's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ADAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>O unhappy youth!</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Come not within these doors; within this roof</span><br/>
<span id='19'>The enemy of all your graces lives:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Your brother&mdash;no, no brother; yet the son&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Yet not the son, I will not call him son</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Of him I was about to call his father&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Hath heard your praises, and this night he means</span><br/>
<span id='24'>To burn the lodging where you use to lie</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And you within it: if he fail of that,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>He will have other means to cut you off.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>I overheard him and his practises.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>This is no place; this house is but a butchery:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ADAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>No matter whither, so you come not here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce</span><br/>
<span id='34'>A thievish living on the common road?</span><br/>
<span id='35'>This I must do, or know not what to do:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Yet this I will not do, do how I can;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>I rather will subject me to the malice</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ADAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>The thrifty hire I saved under your father,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Which I did store to be my foster-nurse</span><br/>
<span id='42'>When service should in my old limbs lie lame</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And unregarded age in corners thrown:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>For in my youth I never did apply</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The means of weakness and debility;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>I'll do the service of a younger man</span><br/>
<span id='56'>In all your business and necessities.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>O good old man, how well in thee appears</span><br/>
<span id='58'>The constant service of the antique world,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>When service sweat for duty, not for meed!</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Thou art not for the fashion of these times,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Where none will sweat but for promotion,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And having that, do choke their service up</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Even with the having: it is not so with thee.</span><br/>
<span id='64'>But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>That cannot so much as a blossom yield</span><br/>
<span id='66'>In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry</span><br/>
<span id='67'>But come thy ways; we'll go along together,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>We'll light upon some settled low content.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ADAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Master, go on, and I will follow thee,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>From seventeen years till now almost fourscore</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Here lived I, but now live here no more.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>But at fourscore it is too late a week:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Yet fortune cannot recompense me better</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Than to die well and not my master's debtor.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<em>Enter SILVIA, VALENTINE, THURIO, and SPEED</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Servant!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Mistress?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SPEED</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Ay, boy, it's for love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SPEED</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Not of you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Of my mistress, then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SPEED</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>'Twere good you knocked him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Servant, you are sad.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Indeed, madam, I seem so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>THURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Seem you that you are not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Haply I do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>THURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>So do counterfeits.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>So do you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>THURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>What seem I that I am not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Wise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>THURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>What instance of the contrary?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Your folly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>THURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>And how quote you my folly?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>I quote it in your jerkin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>THURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>My jerkin is a doublet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Well, then, I'll double your folly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>THURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>How?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>What, angry, Sir Thurio! do you change colour?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>THURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live</span><br/>
<span id='26'>in your air.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>You have said, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>THURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>'Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Who is that, servant?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire. Sir</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>THURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall</span><br/>
<span id='37'>make your wit bankrupt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>and, I think, no other treasure to give your</span><br/>
<span id='40'>followers, for it appears by their bare liveries,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>that they live by your bare words.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>No more, gentlemen, no more:&mdash;here comes my father.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DUKE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>What say you to a letter from your friends</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Of much good news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>                  My lord, I will be thankful.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>To any happy messenger from thence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='51'>To be of worth and worthy estimation</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And not without desert so well reputed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Hath he not a son?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves</span><br/>
<span id='55'>The honour and regard of such a father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>You know him well?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>I know him as myself; for from our infancy</span><br/>
<span id='58'>We have conversed and spent our hours together:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And though myself have been an idle truant,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Omitting the sweet benefit of time</span><br/>
<span id='61'>To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Made use and fair advantage of his days;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>His years but young, but his experience old;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And, in a word, for far behind his worth</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Comes all the praises that I now bestow,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>He is complete in feature and in mind</span><br/>
<span id='69'>With all good grace to grace a gentleman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>He is as worthy for an empress' love</span><br/>
<span id='72'>As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>With commendation from great potentates;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And here he means to spend his time awhile:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Welcome him then according to his worth.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:</span><br/>
<span id='81'>I will send him hither to you presently.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>This is the gentleman I told your ladyship</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Had come along with me, but that his mistress</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Belike that now she hath enfranchised them</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Upon some other pawn for fealty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind</span><br/>
<span id='89'>How could he see his way to seek out you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>THURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>They say that Love hath not an eye at all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Upon a homely object Love can wink.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit THURIO</em></p>
<p><em>Enter PROTEUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Confirm his welcome with some special favour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him</span><br/>
<span id='100'>To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Too low a mistress for so high a servant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Not so, sweet  lady: but too mean a servant</span><br/>
<span id='103'>To have a look of such a worthy mistress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Leave off discourse of disability:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>My duty will I boast of; nothing else.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>And duty never yet did want his meed:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>I'll die on him that says so but yourself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>That you are welcome?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>That you are worthless.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter THURIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>THURIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:</span><br/>
<span id='115'>I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>When you have done, we look to hear from you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>We'll both attend upon your ladyship.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Your friends are well and have them much commended.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>And how do yours?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>                  I left them all in health.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>How does your lady? and how thrives your love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>My tales of love were wont to weary you;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>I know you joy not in a love discourse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:</span><br/>
<span id='126'>I have done penance for contemning Love,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me</span><br/>
<span id='128'>With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>For in revenge of my contempt of love,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes</span><br/>
<span id='132'>And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.</span><br/>
<span id='133'>O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>There is no woe to his correction,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Nor to his service no such joy on earth.</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Now no discourse, except it be of love;</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Upon the very naked name of love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Was this the idol that you worship so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>No; but she is an earthly paragon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Call her divine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>                  I will not flatter her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>And I must minister the like to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Yet let her be a principality,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Except my mistress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Sweet, except not any;</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Except thou wilt except against my love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>Have I not reason to prefer mine own?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>And I will help thee to prefer her too:</span><br/>
<span id='157'>She shall be dignified with this high honour&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss</span><br/>
<span id='160'>And, of so great a favour growing proud,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower</span><br/>
<span id='162'>And make rough winter everlastingly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech89'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing</span><br/>
<span id='165'>To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>She is alone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech90'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>                  Then let her alone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech91'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>And I as rich in having such a jewel</span><br/>
<span id='170'>As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.</span><br/>
<span id='174'>My foolish rival, that her father likes</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Only for his possessions are so huge,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Is gone with her along, and I must after,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech92'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>But she loves you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech93'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>marriage-hour,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>With all the cunning manner of our flight,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Determined of; how I must climb her window,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>The ladder made of cords, and all the means</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech94'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:</span><br/>
<span id='188'>I must unto the road, to disembark</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Some necessaries that I needs must use,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>And then I'll presently attend you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech95'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>Will you make haste?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech96'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>I will.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit VALENTINE</em></p>
<span id='193'>Even as one heat another heat expels,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Or as one nail by strength drives out another,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>So the remembrance of my former love</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Is by a newer object quite forgotten.</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Her true perfection, or my false transgression,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>That makes me reasonless to reason thus?</span><br/>
<span id='200'>She is fair; and so is Julia that I love&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='201'>That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd;</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Bears no impression of the thing it was.</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>And that I love him not as I was wont.</span><br/>
<span id='206'>O, but I love his lady too too much,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>And that's the reason I love him so little.</span><br/>
<span id='208'>How shall I dote on her with more advice,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>That thus without advice begin to love her!</span><br/>
<span id='210'>'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>And that hath dazzled my reason's light;</span><br/>
<span id='212'>But when I look on her perfections,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>There is no reason but I shall be blind.</span><br/>
<span id='214'>If I can cheque my erring love, I will;</span><br/>
<span id='215'>If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

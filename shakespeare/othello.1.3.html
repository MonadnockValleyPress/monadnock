<span id='speech1'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>There is no composition in these news</span><br/>
<span id='2'>That gives them credit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Indeed, they are disproportion'd;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>And mine, a hundred and forty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>And mine, two hundred:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>But though they jump not on a just account,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>As in these cases, where the aim reports,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>'Tis oft with difference&mdash;yet do they all confirm</span><br/>
<span id='10'>A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>I do not so secure me in the error,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>But the main article I do approve</span><br/>
<span id='14'>In fearful sense.</span><br/>

<span id='15'>[Within]  What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!</span><br/>

<span id='speech7'><strong>First Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>A messenger from the galleys.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Sailor</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Now, what's the business?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Sailor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>So was I bid report here to the state</span><br/>
<span id='20'>By Signior Angelo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>How say you by this change?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>This cannot be,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>To keep us in false gaze. When we consider</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And let ourselves again but understand,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>So may he with more facile question bear it,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>For that it stands not in such warlike brace,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But altogether lacks the abilities</span><br/>
<span id='31'>That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>We must not think the Turk is so unskilful</span><br/>
<span id='33'>To leave that latest which concerns him first,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>To wake and wage a danger profitless.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>First Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Here is more news.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Have there injointed them with an after fleet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Of thirty sail: and now they do restem</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Your trusty and most valiant servitor,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>With his free duty recommends you thus,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And prays you to believe him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>He's now in Florence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Officers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Against the general enemy Ottoman.</span><br/>
<p><em>To BRABANTIO</em></p>
<span id='55'>I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Neither my place nor aught I heard of business</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Take hold on me, for my particular grief</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature</span><br/>
<span id='62'>That it engluts and swallows other sorrows</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And it is still itself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Why, what's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>My daughter! O, my daughter!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Dead?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Ay, to me;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted</span><br/>
<span id='69'>By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>For nature so preposterously to err,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Sans witchcraft could not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And you of her, the bloody book of law</span><br/>
<span id='76'>You shall yourself read in the bitter letter</span><br/>
<span id='77'>After your own sense, yea, though our proper son</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Stood in your action.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Humbly I thank your grace.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Your special mandate for the state-affairs</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Hath hither brought.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>We are very sorry for't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>[To OTHELLO]  What, in your own part, can you say to this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Nothing, but this is so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>My very noble and approved good masters,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>It is most true; true, I have married her:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>The very head and front of my offending</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Their dearest action in the tented field,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And little of this great world can I speak,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And therefore little shall I grace my cause</span><br/>
<span id='99'>In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>What conjuration and what mighty magic,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>For such proceeding I am charged withal,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>I won his daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>A maiden never bold;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Of years, of country, credit, every thing,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!</span><br/>
<span id='110'>It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect</span><br/>
<span id='111'>That will confess perfection so could err</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Against all rules of nature, and must be driven</span><br/>
<span id='113'>To find out practises of cunning hell,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Why this should be. I therefore vouch again</span><br/>
<span id='115'>That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Or with some dram conjured to this effect,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>He wrought upon her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>To vouch this, is no proof,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Without more wider and more overt test</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Of modern seeming do prefer against him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>But, Othello, speak:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Did you by indirect and forced courses</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Or came it by request and such fair question</span><br/>
<span id='126'>As soul to soul affordeth?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>I do beseech you,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Send for the lady to the Sagittary,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And let her speak of me before her father:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>If you do find me foul in her report,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>The trust, the office I do hold of you,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Not only take away, but let your sentence</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Even fall upon my life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Fetch Desdemona hither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt IAGO and Attendants</em></p>
<span id='136'>And, till she come, as truly as to heaven</span><br/>
<span id='137'>I do confess the vices of my blood,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>So justly to your grave ears I'll present</span><br/>
<span id='139'>How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>And she in mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Say it, Othello.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Her father loved me; oft invited me;</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Still question'd me the story of my life,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>That I have passed.</span><br/>
<span id='146'>I ran it through, even from my boyish days,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>To the very moment that he bade me tell it;</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Of moving accidents by flood and field</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Of being taken by the insolent foe</span><br/>
<span id='152'>And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence</span><br/>
<span id='153'>And portance in my travels' history:</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven</span><br/>
<span id='156'>It was my hint to speak,&mdash;such was the process;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>And of the Cannibals that each other eat,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>The Anthropophagi and men whose heads</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Would Desdemona seriously incline:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Devour up my discourse: which I observing,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Took once a pliant hour, and found good means</span><br/>
<span id='166'>To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart</span><br/>
<span id='167'>That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Whereof by parcels she had something heard,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>But not intentively: I did consent,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>And often did beguile her of her tears,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>When I did speak of some distressful stroke</span><br/>
<span id='172'>That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:</span><br/>
<span id='174'>She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:</span><br/>
<span id='176'>She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd</span><br/>
<span id='177'>That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>I should but teach him how to tell my story.</span><br/>
<span id='180'>And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:</span><br/>
<span id='181'>She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>And I loved her that she did pity them.</span><br/>
<span id='183'>This only is the witchcraft I have used:</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Here comes the lady; let her witness it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>I think this tale would win my daughter too.</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Good Brabantio,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Take up this mangled matter at the best:</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Men do their broken weapons rather use</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Than their bare hands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>I pray you, hear her speak:</span><br/>
<span id='191'>If she confess that she was half the wooer,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Destruction on my head, if my bad blame</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Do you perceive in all this noble company</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Where most you owe obedience?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>My noble father,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>I do perceive here a divided duty:</span><br/>
<span id='198'>To you I am bound for life and education;</span><br/>
<span id='199'>My life and education both do learn me</span><br/>
<span id='200'>How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;</span><br/>
<span id='201'>I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>And so much duty as my mother show'd</span><br/>
<span id='203'>To you, preferring you before her father,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>So much I challenge that I may profess</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Due to the Moor my lord.</span><br/>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>God be wi' you! I have done.</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:</span><br/>
<span id='208'>I had rather to adopt a child than get it.</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Come hither, Moor:</span><br/>
<span id='210'>I here do give thee that with all my heart</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart</span><br/>
<span id='212'>I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>I am glad at soul I have no other child:</span><br/>
<span id='214'>For thy escape would teach me tyranny,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,</span><br/>
<span id='217'>Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers</span><br/>
<span id='218'>Into your favour.</span><br/>
<span id='219'>When remedies are past, the griefs are ended</span><br/>
<span id='220'>By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.</span><br/>
<span id='221'>To mourn a mischief that is past and gone</span><br/>
<span id='222'>Is the next way to draw new mischief on.</span><br/>
<span id='223'>What cannot be preserved when fortune takes</span><br/>
<span id='224'>Patience her injury a mockery makes.</span><br/>
<span id='225'>The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;</span><br/>
<span id='226'>He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.</span><br/>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BRABANTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='227'>So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;</span><br/>
<span id='228'>We lose it not, so long as we can smile.</span><br/>
<span id='229'>He bears the sentence well that nothing bears</span><br/>
<span id='230'>But the free comfort which from thence he hears,</span><br/>
<span id='231'>But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow</span><br/>
<span id='232'>That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.</span><br/>
<span id='233'>These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,</span><br/>
<span id='234'>Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:</span><br/>
<span id='235'>But words are words; I never yet did hear</span><br/>
<span id='236'>That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.</span><br/>
<span id='237'>I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DUKE OF VENICE</strong></span>

<span id='238'>The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for</span><br/>
<span id='239'>Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best</span><br/>
<span id='240'>known to you; and though we have there a substitute</span><br/>
<span id='241'>of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a</span><br/>
<span id='242'>sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer</span><br/>
<span id='243'>voice on you: you must therefore be content to</span><br/>
<span id='244'>slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this</span><br/>
<span id='245'>more stubborn and boisterous expedition.</span><br/>

<span id='speech50'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>

<span id='249'>A natural and prompt alacrity</span><br/>
<span id='250'>I find in hardness, and do undertake</span><br/>

<span id='252'>Most humbly therefore bending to your state,</span><br/>

<span id='271'>Even to the very quality of my lord:</span><br/>

<span id='speech76'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='342'>Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus</span><br/>
<span id='343'>or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which</span><br/>
<span id='344'>our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant</span><br/>
<span id='345'>nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up</span><br/>

<span id='348'>with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the</span><br/>

<span id='355'>stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that</span><br/>

<span id='360'>cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy</span><br/>
<span id='361'>friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with</span><br/>
<span id='362'>cables of perdurable toughness; I could never</span><br/>
<span id='363'>better stead thee than now. Put money in thy</span><br/>
<span id='364'>purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with</span><br/>
<span id='365'>an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It</span><br/>
<span id='366'>cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her</span><br/>
<span id='367'>love to the Moor,&mdash; put money in thy purse,&mdash;nor he</span><br/>
<span id='368'>his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou</span><br/>
<span id='369'>shalt see an answerable sequestration:&mdash;put but</span><br/>
<span id='370'>money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in</span><br/>
<span id='371'>their wills: fill thy purse with money:&mdash;the food</span><br/>
<span id='372'>that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be</span><br/>
<span id='373'>to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must</span><br/>
<span id='374'>change for youth: when she is sated with his body,</span><br/>
<span id='375'>she will find the error of her choice: she must</span><br/>
<span id='376'>have change, she must: therefore put money in thy</span><br/>
<span id='377'>purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a</span><br/>
<span id='378'>more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money</span><br/>
<span id='379'>thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt</span><br/>
<span id='380'>an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not</span><br/>
<span id='381'>too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou</span><br/>
<span id='382'>shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of</span><br/>
<span id='383'>drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek</span><br/>
<span id='384'>thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than</span><br/>
<span id='385'>to be drowned and go without her.</span><br/>

<span id='390'>hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no</span><br/>
<span id='391'>less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge</span><br/>
<span id='392'>against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost</span><br/>
<span id='393'>thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many</span><br/>

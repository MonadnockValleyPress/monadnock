<h1>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The temple of Diana at Ephesus.</h4>

<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Thaisa standing near the altar, as high priestess; a number of</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Virgins on each side; CERIMON and other Inhabitants</span><br/>
<span id='3'>of Ephesus attending.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PERICLES, with his train; LYSIMACHUS, HELICANUS, MARINA, and a Lady</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I here confess myself the king of Tyre;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Who, frighted from my country, did wed</span><br/>
<span id='7'>At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth</span><br/>
<span id='9'>A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years</span><br/>
<span id='12'>He sought to murder: but her better stars</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Made known herself my daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Voice and favour!</span><br/>
<span id='18'>You are, you are&mdash;O royal Pericles!</span><br/>
<p><em>Faints</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>What means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CERIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Noble sir,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>If you have told Diana's altar true,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>This is your wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>                  Reverend appearer, no;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I threw her overboard with these very arms.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CERIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Upon this coast, I warrant you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>'Tis most certain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CERIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Look to the lady; O, she's but o'erjoy'd.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Early in blustering morn this lady was</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed her</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Here in Diana's temple.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>May we see them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CERIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is recovered.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>O, let me look!</span><br/>
<span id='36'>If he be none of mine, my sanctity</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Like him you are: did you not name a tempest,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>A birth, and death?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>The voice of dead Thaisa!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>That Thaisa am I, supposed dead</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And drown'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Immortal Dian!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>                  Now I know you better.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>When we with tears parted Pentapolis,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The king my father gave you such a ring.</span><br/>
<p><em>Shows a ring</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Makes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>That on the touching of her lips I may</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Melt and no more be seen. O, come, be buried</span><br/>
<span id='53'>A second time within these arms.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>My heart</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.</span><br/>
<p><em>Kneels to THAISA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Thy burden at the sea, and call'd Marina</span><br/>
<span id='58'>For she was yielded there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Blest, and mine own!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Hail, madam, and my queen!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>I know you not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>I left behind an ancient substitute:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Can you remember what I call'd the man?</span><br/>
<span id='65'>I have named him oft.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>'Twas Helicanus then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Still confirmation:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Now do I long to hear how you were found;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>How possibly preserved; and who to thank,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Besides the gods, for this great miracle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can</span><br/>
<span id='74'>From first to last resolve you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Reverend sir,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>The gods can have no mortal officer</span><br/>
<span id='77'>More like a god than you. Will you deliver</span><br/>
<span id='78'>How this dead queen re-lives?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CERIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>I will, my lord.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Beseech you, first go with me to my house,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Where shall be shown you all was found with her;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>How she came placed here in the temple;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>No needful thing omitted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! I</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>This ornament</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And what this fourteen years no razor touch'd,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>To grace thy marriage-day, I'll beautify.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>My father's dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>We'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Will in that kingdom spend our following days:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay</span><br/>
<span id='99'>To hear the rest untold: sir, lead's the way.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
<p><em>Enter GOWER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>GOWER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:</span><br/>
<span id='106'>In Helicanus may you well descry</span><br/>
<span id='107'>A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>In reverend Cerimon there well appears</span><br/>
<span id='109'>The worth that learned charity aye wears:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>That him and his they in his palace burn;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>The gods for murder seemed so content</span><br/>
<span id='115'>To punish them; although not done, but meant.</span><br/>
<span id='116'>So, on your patience evermore attending,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

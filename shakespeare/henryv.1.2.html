<h1>Henry V</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The same. The Presence chamber.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING HENRY V, GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>

<span id='2'>Not here in presence.</span><br/>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>

<span id='3'>Send for him, good uncle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Before we hear him, of some things of weight</span><br/>
<span id='7'>That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP of ELY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CANTERBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>God and his angels guard your sacred throne</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And make you long become it!</span><br/>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Sure, we thank you.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>My learned lord, we pray you to proceed</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And justly and religiously unfold</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Why the law Salique that they have in France</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Or nicely charge your understanding soul</span><br/>
<span id='18'>With opening titles miscreate, whose right</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Suits not in native colours with the truth;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>For God doth know how many now in health</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Shall drop their blood in approbation</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Of what your reverence shall incite us to.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>How you awake our sleeping sword of war:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>For never two such kingdoms did contend</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Are every one a woe, a sore complaint</span><br/>
<span id='29'>'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords</span><br/>
<span id='30'>That make such waste in brief mortality.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>For we will hear, note and believe in heart</span><br/>
<span id='33'>That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd</span><br/>
<span id='34'>As pure as sin with baptism.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CANTERBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>That owe yourselves, your lives and services</span><br/>
<span id='37'>To this imperial throne. There is no bar</span><br/>
<span id='38'>To make against your highness' claim to France</span><br/>
<span id='39'>But this, which they produce from Pharamond,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'</span><br/>
<span id='41'>'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze</span><br/>
<span id='43'>To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</span><br/>
<span id='44'>The founder of this law and female bar.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</span><br/>
<span id='46'>That the land Salique is in Germany,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>There left behind and settled certain French;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Who, holding in disdain the German women</span><br/>
<span id='51'>For some dishonest manners of their life,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Should be inheritrix in Salique land:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Then doth it well appear that Salique law</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Was not devised for the realm of France:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Nor did the French possess the Salique land</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Until four hundred one and twenty years</span><br/>
<span id='60'>After defunction of King Pharamond,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Idly supposed the founder of this law;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Who died within the year of our redemption</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Beyond the river Sala, in the year</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Did, as heir general, being descended</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Make claim and title to the crown of France.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>To find his title with some shows of truth,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</span><br/>
<span id='78'>To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</span><br/>
<span id='83'>That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Was re-united to the crown of France.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</span><br/>
<span id='91'>To hold in right and title of the female:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>So do the kings of France unto this day;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law</span><br/>
<span id='94'>To bar your highness claiming from the female,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And rather choose to hide them in a net</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Than amply to imbar their crooked titles</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>

<span id='146'>But fear the main intendment of the Scot,</span><br/>

<span id='148'>For you shall read that my great-grandfather</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Never went with his forces into France</span><br/>
<span id='150'>But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>With ample and brim fulness of his force,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;</span><br/>
<span id='155'>That England, being empty of defence,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.</span><br/>

<span id='160'>And she a mourning widow of her nobles,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>She hath herself not only well defended</span><br/>
<span id='162'>But taken and impounded as a stray</span><br/>
<span id='163'>The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings</span><br/>
<span id='165'>And make her chronicle as rich with praise</span><br/>
<span id='166'>As is the ooze and bottom of the sea</span><br/>

<span id='173'>Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,</span><br/>

<span id='180'>While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>The advised head defends itself at home;</span><br/>

<span id='187'>The state of man in divers functions,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Setting endeavour in continual motion;</span><br/>
<span id='189'>To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Creatures that by a rule in nature teach</span><br/>
<span id='192'>The act of order to a peopled kingdom.</span><br/>
<span id='193'>They have a king and officers of sorts;</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Which pillage they with merry march bring home</span><br/>
<span id='199'>To the tent-royal of their emperor;</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Who, busied in his majesty, surveys</span><br/>
<span id='201'>The singing masons building roofs of gold,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>The civil citizens kneading up the honey,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>The poor mechanic porters crowding in</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Delivering o'er to executors pale</span><br/>
<span id='207'>The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>That many things, having full reference</span><br/>
<span id='209'>To one consent, may work contrariously:</span><br/>
<span id='210'>As many arrows, loosed several ways,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;</span><br/>
<span id='212'>As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;</span><br/>
<span id='213'>As many lines close in the dial's centre;</span><br/>
<span id='214'>So may a thousand actions, once afoot.</span><br/>
<span id='215'>End in one purpose, and be all well borne</span><br/>
<span id='216'>Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.</span><br/>
<span id='217'>Divide your happy England into four;</span><br/>
<span id='218'>Whereof take you one quarter into France,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.</span><br/>
<span id='220'>If we, with thrice such powers left at home,</span><br/>
<span id='221'>Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,</span><br/>
<span id='222'>Let us be worried and our nation lose</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='304'>We hope to make the sender blush at it.</span><br/>
<span id='305'>Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour</span><br/>
<span id='306'>That may give furtherance to our expedition;</span><br/>
<span id='307'>For we have now no thought in us but France,</span><br/>
<span id='308'>Save those to God, that run before our business.</span><br/>
<span id='309'>Therefore let our proportions for these wars</span><br/>
<span id='310'>Be soon collected and all things thought upon</span><br/>
<span id='311'>That may with reasonable swiftness add</span><br/>
<span id='312'>More feathers to our wings; for, God before,</span><br/>
<span id='313'>We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.</span><br/>
<span id='314'>Therefore let every man now task his thought,</span><br/>
<span id='315'>That this fair action may on foot be brought.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt. Flourish</em></p>

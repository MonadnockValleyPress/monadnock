<h1>Love's Labours Lost</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>The same.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the PRINCESS of France, ROSALINE, MARIA, KATHARINE, BOYET, Lords, and other Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Consider who the king your father sends,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>To parley with the sole inheritor</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Of all perfections that a man may owe,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Be now as prodigal of all dear grace</span><br/>
<span id='10'>As Nature was in making graces dear</span><br/>
<span id='11'>When she did starve the general world beside</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And prodigally gave them all to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>I am less proud to hear you tell my worth</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Than you much willing to be counted wise</span><br/>
<span id='19'>In spending your wit in the praise of mine.</span><br/>
<span id='20'>But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>You are not ignorant, all-telling fame</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Till painful study shall outwear three years,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>No woman may approach his silent court:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Before we enter his forbidden gates,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Bold of your worthiness, we single you</span><br/>
<span id='29'>As our best-moving fair solicitor.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>On serious business, craving quick dispatch,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Importunes personal conference with his grace:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Haste, signify so much; while we attend,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Proud of employment, willingly I go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit BOYET</em></p>
<span id='37'>Who are the votaries, my loving lords,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Lord Longaville is one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Know you the man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MARIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized</span><br/>
<span id='44'>In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills</span><br/>
<span id='52'>It should none spare that come within his power.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MARIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>They say so most that most his humours know.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Who are the rest?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And shape to win grace though he had no wit.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And much too little of that good I saw</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Is my report to his great worthiness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Another of these students at that time</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Biron they call him; but a merrier man,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Within the limit of becoming mirth,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>I never spent an hour's talk withal:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>His eye begets occasion for his wit;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>For every object that the one doth catch</span><br/>
<span id='72'>The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Delivers in such apt and gracious words</span><br/>
<span id='75'>That aged ears play truant at his tales</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And younger hearings are quite ravished;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>So sweet and voluble is his discourse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>God bless my ladies! are they all in love,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>That every one her own hath garnished</span><br/>
<span id='80'>With such bedecking ornaments of praise?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Here comes Boyet.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter BOYET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Now, what admittance, lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Navarre had notice of your fair approach;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And he and his competitors in oath</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:</span><br/>
<span id='87'>He rather means to lodge you in the field,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Like one that comes here to besiege his court,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Than seek a dispensation for his oath,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>To let you enter his unpeopled house.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Here comes Navarre.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have</span><br/>
<span id='94'>not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be</span><br/>
<span id='95'>yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And sin to break it.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:</span><br/>
<span id='109'>To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And suddenly resolve me in my suit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>You will the sooner, that I were away;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>I know you did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>How needless was it then to ask the question!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>You must not be so quick.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Not till it leave the rider in the mire.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>What time o' day?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>The hour that fools should ask.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Now fair befall your mask!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Fair fall the face it covers!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>And send you many lovers!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Amen, so you be none.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Nay, then will I be gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Madam, your father here doth intimate</span><br/>
<span id='131'>The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Being but the one half of an entire sum</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Disbursed by my father in his wars.</span><br/>
<span id='134'>But say that he or we, as neither have,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid</span><br/>
<span id='136'>A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Although not valued to the money's worth.</span><br/>
<span id='139'>If then the king your father will restore</span><br/>
<span id='140'>But that one half which is unsatisfied,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>We will give up our right in Aquitaine,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>And hold fair friendship with his majesty.</span><br/>
<span id='143'>But that, it seems, he little purposeth,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>For here he doth demand to have repaid</span><br/>
<span id='145'>A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>To have his title live in Aquitaine;</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Which we much rather had depart withal</span><br/>
<span id='149'>And have the money by our father lent</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Dear Princess, were not his requests so far</span><br/>
<span id='152'>From reason's yielding, your fair self should make</span><br/>
<span id='153'>A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast</span><br/>
<span id='154'>And go well satisfied to France again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>You do the king my father too much wrong</span><br/>
<span id='156'>And wrong the reputation of your name,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>In so unseeming to confess receipt</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>I do protest I never heard of it;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>And if you prove it, I'll repay it back</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Or yield up Aquitaine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>We arrest your word.</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Boyet, you can produce acquittances</span><br/>
<span id='164'>For such a sum from special officers</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Of Charles his father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Satisfy me so.</span><br/>

<span id='167'>So please your grace, the packet is not come</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Where that and other specialties are bound:</span><br/>
<span id='169'>To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>It shall suffice me: at which interview</span><br/>
<span id='171'>All liberal reason I will yield unto.</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Meantime receive such welcome at my hand</span><br/>
<span id='173'>As honour without breach of honour may</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Make tender of to thy true worthiness:</span><br/>
<span id='175'>You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;</span><br/>
<span id='176'>But here without you shall be so received</span><br/>
<span id='177'>As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Though so denied fair harbour in my house.</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:</span><br/>
<span id='180'>To-morrow shall we visit you again.</span><br/>

<span id='185'>I would you heard it groan.</span><br/>

<span id='186'>Is the fool sick?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>

<span id='187'>Sick at the heart.</span><br/>

<span id='240'>Why, all his behaviors did make their retire</span><br/>
<span id='241'>To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:</span><br/>
<span id='242'>His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,</span><br/>
<span id='243'>Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:</span><br/>
<span id='244'>His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,</span><br/>
<span id='245'>Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;</span><br/>
<span id='246'>All senses to that sense did make their repair,</span><br/>
<span id='247'>To feel only looking on fairest of fair:</span><br/>
<span id='248'>Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,</span><br/>
<span id='249'>As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;</span><br/>
<span id='250'>Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,</span><br/>
<span id='251'>Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:</span><br/>
<span id='252'>His face's own margent did quote such amazes</span><br/>
<span id='253'>That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.</span><br/>
<span id='254'>I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,</span><br/>
<span id='255'>An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.</span><br/>

<span id='257'>But to speak that in words which his eye hath</span><br/>
<span id='258'>disclosed.</span><br/>

<span id='260'>By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.</span><br/>

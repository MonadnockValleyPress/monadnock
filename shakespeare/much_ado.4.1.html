<h1>Much Ado About Nothing</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>A church.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, LEONATO, FRIAR FRANCIS, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, HERO, BEATRICE, and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Come, Friar Francis, be brief; only to the plain</span><br/>
<span id='2'>form of marriage, and you shall recount their</span><br/>
<span id='3'>particular duties afterwards.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>No.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>To be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>I do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>If either of you know any inward impediment why you</span><br/>
<span id='10'>should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>to utter it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Know you any, Hero?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>None, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Know you any, count?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>I dare make his answer, none.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily</span><br/>
<span id='17'>do, not knowing what they do!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of</span><br/>
<span id='19'>laughing, as, ah, ha, he!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Will you with free and unconstrained soul</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Give me this maid, your daughter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>As freely, son, as God did give her me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>And what have I to give you back, whose worth</span><br/>
<span id='25'>May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Nothing, unless you render her again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>There, Leonato, take her back again:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Give not this rotten orange to your friend;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Behold how like a maid she blushes here!</span><br/>
<span id='32'>O, what authority and show of truth</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Can cunning sin cover itself withal!</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Comes not that blood as modest evidence</span><br/>
<span id='35'>To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>All you that see her, that she were a maid,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>By these exterior shows? But she is none:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>What do you mean, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Not to be married,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And made defeat of her virginity,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>I know what you would say: if I have known her,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>You will say she did embrace me as a husband,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>No, Leonato,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>I never tempted her with word too large;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>But, as a brother to his sister, show'd</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Bashful sincerity and comely love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>You seem to me as Dian in her orb,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>But you are more intemperate in your blood</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals</span><br/>
<span id='59'>That rage in savage sensuality.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Sweet prince, why speak not you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>What should I speak?</span><br/>
<span id='63'>I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about</span><br/>
<span id='64'>To link my dear friend to a common stale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>This looks not like a nuptial.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>True! O God!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Leonato, stand I here?</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>All this is so: but what of this, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Let me but move one question to your daughter;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And, by that fatherly and kindly power</span><br/>
<span id='75'>That you have in her, bid her answer truly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>O, God defend me! how am I beset!</span><br/>
<span id='78'>What kind of catechising call you this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>To make you answer truly to your name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name</span><br/>
<span id='81'>With any just reproach?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Marry, that can Hero;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>What man was he talk'd with you yesternight</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Myself, my brother and this grieved count</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Confess'd the vile encounters they have had</span><br/>
<span id='95'>A thousand times in secret.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Not to be spoke of;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>There is not chastity enough in language</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>If half thy outward graces had been placed</span><br/>
<span id='103'>About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!</span><br/>
<span id='104'>But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Thou pure impiety and impious purity!</span><br/>
<span id='106'>For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And never shall it more be gracious.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?</span><br/>
<p><em>HERO swoons</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Smother her spirits up.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, and CLAUDIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>How doth the lady?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>                  Dead, I think. Help, uncle!</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Death is the fairest cover for her shame</span><br/>
<span id='119'>That may be wish'd for.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>How now, cousin Hero!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Have comfort, lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Dost thou look up?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Yea, wherefore should she not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny</span><br/>
<span id='126'>The story that is printed in her blood?</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:</span><br/>
<span id='128'>For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?</span><br/>
<span id='133'>O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Why had I not with charitable hand</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>I might have said 'No part of it is mine;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?</span><br/>
<span id='140'>But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised</span><br/>
<span id='141'>And mine that I was proud on, mine so much</span><br/>
<span id='142'>That I myself was to myself not mine,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Valuing of her,&mdash;why, she, O, she is fallen</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Hath drops too few to wash her clean again</span><br/>
<span id='146'>And salt too little which may season give</span><br/>
<span id='147'>To her foul-tainted flesh!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Sir, sir, be patient.</span><br/>
<span id='149'>For my part, I am so attired in wonder,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>I know not what to say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>No, truly not; although, until last night,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Hear me a little;</span><br/>
<span id='161'>For I have only been silent so long</span><br/>
<span id='162'>And given way unto this course of fortune.</span><br/>
<span id='163'>...</span><br/>
<span id='164'>By noting of the lady I have mark'd</span><br/>
<span id='165'>A thousand blushing apparitions</span><br/>
<span id='166'>To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames</span><br/>
<span id='167'>In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;</span><br/>
<span id='168'>And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>To burn the errors that these princes hold</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Trust not my reading nor my observations,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Which with experimental seal doth warrant</span><br/>
<span id='173'>The tenor of my book; trust not my age,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>My reverence, calling, nor divinity,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Under some biting error.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>Friar, it cannot be.</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Is that she will not add to her damnation</span><br/>
<span id='180'>A sin of perjury; she not denies it:</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse</span><br/>
<span id='182'>That which appears in proper nakedness?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>Lady, what man is he you are accused of?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>They know that do accuse me; I know none:</span><br/>
<span id='185'>If I know more of any man alive</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Prove you that any man with me conversed</span><br/>
<span id='189'>At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>There is some strange misprision in the princes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>Two of them have the very bent of honour;</span><br/>
<span id='194'>And if their wisdoms be misled in this,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>The practise of it lives in John the bastard,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>I know not. If they speak but truth of her,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>The proudest of them shall well hear of it.</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Nor age so eat up my invention,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Both strength of limb and policy of mind,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Ability in means and choice of friends,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>To quit me of them throughly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>Pause awhile,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>And let my counsel sway you in this case.</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Your daughter here the princes left for dead:</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Let her awhile be secretly kept in,</span><br/>
<span id='212'>And publish it that she is dead indeed;</span><br/>
<span id='213'>Maintain a mourning ostentation</span><br/>
<span id='214'>And on your family's old monument</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites</span><br/>
<span id='216'>That appertain unto a burial.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>What shall become of this? what will this do?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Change slander to remorse; that is some good:</span><br/>
<span id='220'>But not for that dream I on this strange course,</span><br/>
<span id='221'>But on this travail look for greater birth.</span><br/>
<span id='222'>She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,</span><br/>
<span id='223'>Upon the instant that she was accused,</span><br/>
<span id='224'>Shall be lamented, pitied and excused</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Of every hearer: for it so falls out</span><br/>
<span id='226'>That what we have we prize not to the worth</span><br/>
<span id='227'>Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Why, then we rack the value, then we find</span><br/>
<span id='229'>The virtue that possession would not show us</span><br/>
<span id='230'>Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:</span><br/>
<span id='231'>When he shall hear she died upon his words,</span><br/>
<span id='232'>The idea of her life shall sweetly creep</span><br/>
<span id='233'>Into his study of imagination,</span><br/>
<span id='234'>And every lovely organ of her life</span><br/>
<span id='235'>Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,</span><br/>
<span id='236'>More moving-delicate and full of life,</span><br/>
<span id='237'>Into the eye and prospect of his soul,</span><br/>
<span id='238'>Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,</span><br/>
<span id='239'>If ever love had interest in his liver,</span><br/>
<span id='240'>And wish he had not so accused her,</span><br/>
<span id='241'>No, though he thought his accusation true.</span><br/>
<span id='242'>Let this be so, and doubt not but success</span><br/>
<span id='243'>Will fashion the event in better shape</span><br/>
<span id='244'>Than I can lay it down in likelihood.</span><br/>
<span id='245'>But if all aim but this be levell'd false,</span><br/>
<span id='246'>The supposition of the lady's death</span><br/>
<span id='247'>Will quench the wonder of her infamy:</span><br/>
<span id='248'>And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,</span><br/>
<span id='249'>As best befits her wounded reputation,</span><br/>
<span id='250'>In some reclusive and religious life,</span><br/>
<span id='251'>Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='252'>Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:</span><br/>
<span id='253'>And though you know my inwardness and love</span><br/>
<span id='254'>Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,</span><br/>
<span id='255'>Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this</span><br/>
<span id='256'>As secretly and justly as your soul</span><br/>
<span id='257'>Should with your body.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='258'>Being that I flow in grief,</span><br/>
<span id='259'>The smallest twine may lead me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>FRIAR FRANCIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='260'>'Tis well consented: presently away;</span><br/>
<span id='261'>For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.</span><br/>
<span id='262'>Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day</span><br/>
<span id='263'>Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='264'>Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='265'>Yea, and I will weep a while longer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='266'>I will not desire that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='267'>You have no reason; I do it freely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='268'>Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='269'>Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='270'>Is there any way to show such friendship?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='271'>A very even way, but no such friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='272'>May a man do it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='273'>It is a man's office, but not yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='274'>I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is</span><br/>
<span id='275'>not that strange?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='276'>As strange as the thing I know not. It were as</span><br/>
<span id='277'>possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as</span><br/>
<span id='278'>you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I</span><br/>
<span id='279'>confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='280'>By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='281'>Do not swear, and eat it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='282'>I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make</span><br/>
<span id='283'>him eat it that says I love not you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='284'>Will you not eat your word?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech89'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='285'>With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest</span><br/>
<span id='286'>I love thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech90'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='287'>Why, then, God forgive me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech91'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='288'>What offence, sweet Beatrice?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech92'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='289'>You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to</span><br/>
<span id='290'>protest I loved you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech93'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='291'>And do it with all thy heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech94'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='292'>I love you with so much of my heart that none is</span><br/>
<span id='293'>left to protest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech95'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='294'>Come, bid me do any thing for thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech96'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='295'>Kill Claudio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech97'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='296'>Ha! not for the wide world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech98'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='297'>You kill me to deny it. Farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech99'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='298'>Tarry, sweet Beatrice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech100'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='299'>I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in</span><br/>
<span id='300'>you: nay, I pray you, let me go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech101'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='301'>Beatrice,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech102'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='302'>In faith, I will go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech103'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='303'>We'll be friends first.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech104'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='304'>You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech105'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='305'>Is Claudio thine enemy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech106'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='306'>Is he not approved in the height a villain, that</span><br/>
<span id='307'>hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O</span><br/>
<span id='308'>that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they</span><br/>
<span id='309'>come to take hands; and then, with public</span><br/>
<span id='310'>accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,</span><br/>
<span id='311'>&mdash;O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart</span><br/>
<span id='312'>in the market-place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech107'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='313'>Hear me, Beatrice,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech108'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='314'>Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech109'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='315'>Nay, but, Beatrice,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech110'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='316'>Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech111'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='317'>Beat&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech112'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='318'>Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,</span><br/>
<span id='319'>a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,</span><br/>
<span id='320'>surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I</span><br/>
<span id='321'>had any friend would be a man for my sake! But</span><br/>
<span id='322'>manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into</span><br/>
<span id='323'>compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and</span><br/>
<span id='324'>trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules</span><br/>
<span id='325'>that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a</span><br/>
<span id='326'>man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech113'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='327'>Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech114'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='328'>Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech115'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='329'>Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech116'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='330'>Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech117'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='331'>Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I will</span><br/>
<span id='332'>kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,</span><br/>
<span id='333'>Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you</span><br/>
<span id='334'>hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your</span><br/>
<span id='335'>cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.</span><br/>

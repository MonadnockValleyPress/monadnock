<em>Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</em>

<span id='speech1'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Is there no way for men to be but women</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Must be half-workers? We are all bastards;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And that most venerable man which I</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Did call my father, was I know not where</span><br/>
<span id='5'>When I was stamp'd; some coiner with his tools</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'd</span><br/>
<span id='7'>The Dian of that time so doth my wife</span><br/>
<span id='8'>The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with</span><br/>
<span id='11'>A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her</span><br/>
<span id='13'>As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!</span><br/>
<span id='14'>This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,&mdash;wast not?&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Or less,&mdash;at first?&mdash;perchance he spoke not, but,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition</span><br/>
<span id='18'>But what he look'd for should oppose and she</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Should from encounter guard. Could I find out</span><br/>
<span id='20'>The woman's part in me! For there's no motion</span><br/>
<span id='21'>That tends to vice in man, but I affirm</span><br/>
<span id='22'>It is the woman's part: be it lying, note it,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Nice longing, slanders, mutability,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Why, hers, in part or all; but rather, all;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>For even to vice</span><br/>
<span id='30'>They are not constant but are changing still</span><br/>
<span id='31'>One vice, but of a minute old, for one</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill</span><br/>
<span id='34'>In a true hate, to pray they have their will:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>The very devils cannot plague them better.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

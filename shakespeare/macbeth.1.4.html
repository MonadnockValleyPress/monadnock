<h1>Macbeth</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Forres. The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Flourish. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUNCAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Those in commission yet return'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>My liege,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>They are not yet come back. But I have spoke</span><br/>
<span id='5'>With one that saw him die: who did report</span><br/>
<span id='6'>That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Implored your highness' pardon and set forth</span><br/>
<span id='8'>A deep repentance: nothing in his life</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Became him like the leaving it; he died</span><br/>
<span id='10'>As one that had been studied in his death</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To throw away the dearest thing he owed,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>As 'twere a careless trifle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DUNCAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>There's no art</span><br/>
<span id='14'>To find the mind's construction in the face:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>He was a gentleman on whom I built</span><br/>
<span id='16'>An absolute trust.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS</em></p>
<span id='17'>O worthiest cousin!</span><br/>
<span id='18'>The sin of my ingratitude even now</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Was heavy on me: thou art so far before</span><br/>
<span id='20'>That swiftest wing of recompense is slow</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>That the proportion both of thanks and payment</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Might have been mine! only I have left to say,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>More is thy due than more than all can pay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>The service and the loyalty I owe,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Is to receive our duties; and our duties</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Are to your throne and state, children and servants,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Which do but what they should, by doing every thing</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Safe toward your love and honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUNCAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Welcome hither:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>I have begun to plant thee, and will labour</span><br/>
<span id='33'>To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>That hast no less deserved, nor must be known</span><br/>
<span id='35'>No less to have done so, let me enfold thee</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And hold thee to my heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>There if I grow,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>The harvest is your own.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DUNCAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>My plenteous joys,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves</span><br/>
<span id='41'>In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And you whose places are the nearest, know</span><br/>
<span id='43'>We will establish our estate upon</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter</span><br/>
<span id='45'>The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Not unaccompanied invest him only,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine</span><br/>
<span id='48'>On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And bind us further to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>The rest is labour, which is not used for you:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The hearing of my wife with your approach;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>So humbly take my leave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DUNCAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>My worthy Cawdor!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>[Aside]  The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step</span><br/>
<span id='56'>On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Let not light see my black and deep desires:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DUNCAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And in his commendations I am fed;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>It is a peerless kinsman.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish. Exeunt</em></p>

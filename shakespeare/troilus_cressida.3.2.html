<h1>Troilus and Cressida</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</H3>
<h4>The same. Pandarus' orchard.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter PANDARUS and Troilus's Boy, meeting</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>How now! where's thy master? at my cousin</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Cressida's?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Boy</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>No, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>O, here he comes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter TROILUS</em></p>
<span id='5'>How now, how now!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Sirrah, walk off.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Boy</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Have you seen my cousin?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And give me swift transportance to those fields</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Where I may wallow in the lily-beds</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Proposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And fly with me to Cressid!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Walk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>The imaginary relish is so sweet</span><br/>
<span id='19'>That it enchants my sense: what will it be,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>When that the watery palate tastes indeed</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>For the capacity of my ruder powers:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>I fear it much; and I do fear besides,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>That I shall lose distinction in my joys;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps</span><br/>
<span id='28'>The enemy flying.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter PANDARUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>She's making her ready, she'll come straight: you</span><br/>
<span id='30'>must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches</span><br/>
<span id='31'>her wind so short, as if she were frayed with a</span><br/>
<span id='32'>sprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest</span><br/>
<span id='33'>villain: she fetches her breath as short as a</span><br/>
<span id='34'>new-ta'en sparrow.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And all my powers do their bestowing lose,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Like vassalage at unawares encountering</span><br/>
<span id='39'>The eye of majesty.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter PANDARUS with CRESSIDA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Come, come, what need you blush? shame's a baby.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that</span><br/>
<span id='42'>you have sworn to me. What, are you gone again?</span><br/>
<span id='43'>you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you?</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw backward,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak to</span><br/>
<span id='46'>her? Come, draw this curtain, and let's see your</span><br/>
<span id='47'>picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend</span><br/>
<span id='48'>daylight! an 'twere dark, you'ld close sooner.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress. How now!</span><br/>
<span id='50'>a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter; the air</span><br/>
<span id='51'>is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere</span><br/>
<span id='52'>I part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the</span><br/>
<span id='53'>ducks i' the river: go to, go to.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>You have bereft me of all words, lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Words pay no debts, give her deeds: but she'll</span><br/>
<span id='56'>bereave you o' the deeds too, if she call your</span><br/>
<span id='57'>activity in question. What, billing again? Here's</span><br/>
<span id='58'>'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably'&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Will you walk in, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Wished, my lord! The gods grant,&mdash;O my lord!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>What should they grant? what makes this pretty</span><br/>
<span id='64'>abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet</span><br/>
<span id='65'>lady in the fountain of our love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer</span><br/>
<span id='69'>footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to</span><br/>
<span id='70'>fear the worst oft cures the worse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>O, let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid's</span><br/>
<span id='72'>pageant there is presented no monster.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Nor nothing monstrous neither?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Nothing, but our undertakings; when we vow to weep</span><br/>
<span id='75'>seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinking</span><br/>
<span id='76'>it harder for our mistress to devise imposition</span><br/>
<span id='77'>enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.</span><br/>
<span id='78'>This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will</span><br/>
<span id='79'>is infinite and the execution confined, that the</span><br/>
<span id='80'>desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>They say all lovers swear more performance than they</span><br/>
<span id='82'>are able and yet reserve an ability that they never</span><br/>
<span id='83'>perform, vowing more than the perfection of ten and</span><br/>
<span id='84'>discharging less than the tenth part of one. They</span><br/>
<span id='85'>that have the voice of lions and the act of hares,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>are they not monsters?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Are there such? such are not we: praise us as we</span><br/>
<span id='88'>are tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall go</span><br/>
<span id='89'>bare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversion</span><br/>
<span id='90'>shall have a praise in present: we will not name</span><br/>
<span id='91'>desert before his birth, and, being born, his addition</span><br/>
<span id='92'>shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus</span><br/>
<span id='93'>shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst</span><br/>
<span id='94'>shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can</span><br/>
<span id='95'>speak truest not truer than Troilus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Will you walk in, my lord?</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter PANDARUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>What, blushing still? have you not done talking yet?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if he</span><br/>
<span id='101'>flinch, chide me for it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>You know now your hostages; your uncle's word and my</span><br/>
<span id='103'>firm faith.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>though they be long ere they are wooed, they are</span><br/>
<span id='106'>constant being won: they are burs, I can tell you;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>they'll stick where they are thrown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day</span><br/>
<span id='110'>For many weary months.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>With the first glance that ever&mdash;pardon me&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.</span><br/>
<span id='115'>I love you now; but not, till now, so much</span><br/>
<span id='116'>But I might master it: in faith, I lie;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>When we are so unsecret to ourselves?</span><br/>
<span id='121'>But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Or that we women had men's privilege</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>For in this rapture I shall surely speak</span><br/>
<span id='126'>The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws</span><br/>
<span id='128'>My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Pretty, i' faith.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:</span><br/>
<span id='133'>I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?</span><br/>
<span id='134'>For this time will I take my leave, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Your leave, sweet Cressid!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Pray you, content you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>What offends you, lady?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Sir, mine own company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>You cannot shun Yourself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>        Let me go and try:</span><br/>
<span id='142'>I have a kind of self resides with you;</span><br/>
<span id='143'>But an unkind self, that itself will leave,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>To be another's fool. I would be gone:</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;</span><br/>
<span id='148'>And fell so roundly to a large confession,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Or else you love not, for to be wise and love</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>O that I thought it could be in a woman&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='153'>As, if it can, I will presume in you&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='154'>To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;</span><br/>
<span id='155'>To keep her constancy in plight and youth,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind</span><br/>
<span id='157'>That doth renew swifter than blood decays!</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>That my integrity and truth to you</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Might be affronted with the match and weight</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Of such a winnow'd purity in love;</span><br/>
<span id='162'>How were I then uplifted! but, alas!</span><br/>
<span id='163'>I am as true as truth's simplicity</span><br/>
<span id='164'>And simpler than the infancy of truth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>In that I'll war with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>O virtuous fight,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>When right with right wars who shall be most right!</span><br/>
<span id='168'>True swains in love shall in the world to come</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Full of protest, of oath and big compare,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Want similes, truth tired with iteration,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Yet, after all comparisons of truth,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>As truth's authentic author to be cited,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>And sanctify the numbers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Prophet may you be!</span><br/>
<span id='180'>If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>When time is old and hath forgot itself,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>And mighty states characterless are grated</span><br/>
<span id='185'>To dusty nothing, yet let memory,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>From false to false, among false maids in love,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false</span><br/>
<span id='188'>As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,'</span><br/>
<span id='191'>'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>'As false as Cressid.'</span><br/>

<span id='speech51'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it; I'll be the</span><br/>

<span id='195'>If ever you prove false one to another, since I have</span><br/>

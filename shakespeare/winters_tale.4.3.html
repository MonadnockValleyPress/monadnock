<h4>A road near the Shepherd's cottage.</h4>

<em>Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>When daffodils begin to peer,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>With heigh! the doxy over the dale,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Are summer songs for me and my aunts,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>While we lie tumbling in the hay.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>I have served Prince Florizel and in my time</span><br/>
<span id='14'>wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The pale moon shines by night:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And when I wander here and there,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I then do most go right.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>If tinkers may have leave to live,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And bear the sow-skin budget,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Then my account I well may, give,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And in the stocks avouch it.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to</span><br/>
<span id='24'>lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who</span><br/>
<span id='25'>being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise</span><br/>
<span id='26'>a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and</span><br/>
<span id='27'>drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is</span><br/>
<span id='28'>the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful</span><br/>
<span id='29'>on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to</span><br/>
<span id='30'>me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought</span><br/>
<span id='31'>of it. A prize! a prize!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Clown</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod</span><br/>
<span id='33'>yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred</span><br/>
<span id='34'>shorn. what comes the wool to?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>[Aside]</span><br/>
<span id='36'>If the springe hold, the cock's mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am</span><br/>
<span id='38'>I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound</span><br/>
<span id='39'>of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,&mdash;what will</span><br/>
<span id='40'>this sister of mine do with rice? But my father</span><br/>
<span id='41'>hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it</span><br/>
<span id='42'>on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for</span><br/>
<span id='43'>the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good</span><br/>
<span id='44'>ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but</span><br/>
<span id='45'>one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to</span><br/>
<span id='46'>horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden</span><br/>
<span id='47'>pies; mace; dates?&mdash;none, that's out of my note;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I</span><br/>
<span id='49'>may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of</span><br/>
<span id='50'>raisins o' the sun.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>O that ever I was born!</span><br/>
<p><em>Grovelling on the ground</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>I' the name of me&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and</span><br/>
<span id='54'>then, death, death!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay</span><br/>
<span id='56'>on thee, rather than have these off.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more</span><br/>
<span id='58'>than the stripes I have received, which are mighty</span><br/>
<span id='59'>ones and millions.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a</span><br/>
<span id='61'>great matter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel</span><br/>
<span id='63'>ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon</span><br/>
<span id='64'>me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>What, by a horseman, or a footman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>A footman, sweet sir, a footman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he</span><br/>
<span id='68'>has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>O, good sir, tenderly, O!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Alas, poor soul!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my</span><br/>
<span id='74'>shoulder-blade is out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>How now! canst stand?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>[Picking his pocket]</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Softly, dear sir; good sir, softly. You ha' done me</span><br/>
<span id='78'>a charitable office.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have</span><br/>
<span id='81'>a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or</span><br/>
<span id='83'>any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>that kills my heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with</span><br/>
<span id='87'>troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the</span><br/>
<span id='88'>prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his</span><br/>
<span id='89'>virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped</span><br/>
<span id='91'>out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay</span><br/>
<span id='92'>there; and yet it will no more but abide.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he</span><br/>
<span id='94'>hath been since an ape-bearer; then a</span><br/>
<span id='95'>process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a</span><br/>
<span id='96'>motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's</span><br/>
<span id='97'>wife within a mile where my land and living lies;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>and, having flown over many knavish professions, he</span><br/>
<span id='99'>settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts</span><br/>
<span id='101'>wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that</span><br/>
<span id='103'>put me into this apparel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had</span><br/>
<span id='105'>but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am</span><br/>
<span id='107'>false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant</span><br/>
<span id='108'>him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>How do you now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and</span><br/>
<span id='111'>walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace</span><br/>
<span id='112'>softly towards my kinsman's.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Shall I bring thee on the way?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our</span><br/>
<span id='116'>sheep-shearing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>AUTOLYCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Prosper you, sweet sir!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Clown</em></p>
<span id='118'>Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.</span><br/>
<span id='119'>I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I</span><br/>
<span id='120'>make not this cheat bring out another and the</span><br/>
<span id='121'>shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name</span><br/>
<span id='122'>put in the book of virtue!</span><br/>
<p><em>Sings</em></p>
<span id='123'>Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And merrily hent the stile-a:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>A merry heart goes all the day,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Your sad tires in a mile-a.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

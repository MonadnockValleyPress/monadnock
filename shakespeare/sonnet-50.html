<h3>L</h3>
<p>
How heavy do I journey on the way,<br/>
When what I seek, my weary travel's end,<br/>
Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,<br/>
'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'<br/>
The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,<br/>
Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,<br/>
As if by some instinct the wretch did know<br/>
His rider lov'd not speed, being made from thee:<br/>
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,<br/>
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,<br/>
Which heavily he answers with a groan,<br/>
More sharp to me than spurring to his side;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that same groan doth put this in my mind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grief lies onward, and my joy behind.<br/>

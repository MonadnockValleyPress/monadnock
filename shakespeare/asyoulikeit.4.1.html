<h1>As You Like It</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</H3>
<h4>The forest.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>JAQUES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted</span><br/>
<span id='2'>with thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>They say you are a melancholy fellow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>JAQUES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>I am so; I do love it better than laughing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Those that are in extremity of either are abominable</span><br/>
<span id='6'>fellows and betray themselves to every modern</span><br/>
<span id='7'>censure worse than drunkards.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>JAQUES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Why then, 'tis good to be a post.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>JAQUES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is</span><br/>
<span id='11'>emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the</span><br/>
<span id='13'>soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor</span><br/>
<span id='15'>the lover's, which is all these: but it is a</span><br/>
<span id='16'>melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's</span><br/>
<span id='18'>contemplation of my travels, in which my often</span><br/>
<span id='19'>rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to</span><br/>
<span id='21'>be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see</span><br/>
<span id='22'>other men's; then, to have seen much and to have</span><br/>
<span id='23'>nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>JAQUES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Yes, I have gained my experience.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have</span><br/>
<span id='26'>a fool to make me merry than experience to make me</span><br/>
<span id='27'>sad; and to travel for it too!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ORLANDO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>JAQUES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and</span><br/>
<span id='31'>wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your</span><br/>
<span id='32'>own country, be out of love with your nativity and</span><br/>
<span id='33'>almost chide God for making you that countenance you</span><br/>
<span id='34'>are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a</span><br/>
<span id='35'>gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been</span><br/>
<span id='36'>all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such</span><br/>
<span id='37'>another trick, never come in my sight more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Break an hour's promise in love! He that will</span><br/>
<span id='40'>divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but</span><br/>
<span id='41'>a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the</span><br/>
<span id='42'>affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid</span><br/>
<span id='43'>hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant</span><br/>
<span id='44'>him heart-whole.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Pardon me, dear Rosalind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I</span><br/>
<span id='47'>had as lief be wooed of a snail.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Of a snail?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he</span><br/>
<span id='50'>carries his house on his head; a better jointure,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings</span><br/>
<span id='52'>his destiny with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>What's that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be</span><br/>
<span id='55'>beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in</span><br/>
<span id='56'>his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>And I am your Rosalind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Rosalind of a better leer than you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday</span><br/>
<span id='62'>humour and like enough to consent. What would you</span><br/>
<span id='63'>say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>I would kiss before I spoke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were</span><br/>
<span id='66'>gravelled for lack of matter, you might take</span><br/>
<span id='67'>occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are</span><br/>
<span id='68'>out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking&mdash;God</span><br/>
<span id='69'>warn us!&mdash;matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>How if the kiss be denied?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or</span><br/>
<span id='74'>I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>What, of my suit?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Am not I your Rosalind?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>I take some joy to say you are, because I would be</span><br/>
<span id='79'>talking of her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Well in her person I say I will not have you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Then in mine own person I die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is</span><br/>
<span id='83'>almost six thousand years old, and in all this time</span><br/>
<span id='84'>there was not any man died in his own person,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains</span><br/>
<span id='86'>dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he</span><br/>
<span id='87'>could to die before, and he is one of the patterns</span><br/>
<span id='88'>of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair</span><br/>
<span id='89'>year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been</span><br/>
<span id='90'>for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went</span><br/>
<span id='91'>but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being</span><br/>
<span id='92'>taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish</span><br/>
<span id='93'>coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'</span><br/>
<span id='94'>But these are all lies: men have died from time to</span><br/>
<span id='95'>time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>for, I protest, her frown might kill me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now</span><br/>
<span id='99'>I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on</span><br/>
<span id='100'>disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant</span><br/>
<span id='101'>it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Then love me, Rosalind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>And wilt thou have me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Ay, and twenty such.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>What sayest thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Are you not good?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>I hope so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Pray thee, marry us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>I cannot say the words.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando&mdash;'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Ay, but when?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Why now; as fast as she can marry us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>I might ask you for your commission; but I do take</span><br/>
<span id='122'>thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes</span><br/>
<span id='123'>before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought</span><br/>
<span id='124'>runs before her actions.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>So do all thoughts; they are winged.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Now tell me how long you would have her after you</span><br/>
<span id='127'>have possessed her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>For ever and a day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>men are April when they woo, December when they wed:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>maids are May when they are maids, but the sky</span><br/>
<span id='132'>changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous</span><br/>
<span id='133'>of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more</span><br/>
<span id='135'>new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires</span><br/>
<span id='136'>than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana</span><br/>
<span id='137'>in the fountain, and I will do that when you are</span><br/>
<span id='138'>disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and</span><br/>
<span id='139'>that when thou art inclined to sleep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>But will my Rosalind do so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>By my life, she will do as I do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>O, but she is wise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the</span><br/>
<span id='144'>wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's</span><br/>
<span id='145'>wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and</span><br/>
<span id='146'>'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly</span><br/>
<span id='147'>with the smoke out at the chimney.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say</span><br/>
<span id='149'>'Wit, whither wilt?'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met</span><br/>
<span id='151'>your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>And what wit could wit have to excuse that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall</span><br/>
<span id='154'>never take her without her answer, unless you take</span><br/>
<span id='155'>her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot</span><br/>
<span id='156'>make her fault her husband's occasion, let her</span><br/>
<span id='157'>never nurse her child herself, for she will breed</span><br/>
<span id='158'>it like a fool!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I</span><br/>
<span id='162'>will be with thee again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you</span><br/>
<span id='164'>would prove: my friends told me as much, and I</span><br/>
<span id='165'>thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours</span><br/>
<span id='166'>won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>death! Two o'clock is your hour?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Ay, sweet Rosalind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend</span><br/>
<span id='170'>me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>if you break one jot of your promise or come one</span><br/>
<span id='172'>minute behind your hour, I will think you the most</span><br/>
<span id='173'>pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover</span><br/>
<span id='174'>and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that</span><br/>
<span id='175'>may be chosen out of the gross band of the</span><br/>
<span id='176'>unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep</span><br/>
<span id='177'>your promise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Rosalind: so adieu.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such</span><br/>
<span id='181'>offenders, and let Time try: adieu.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit ORLANDO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:</span><br/>
<span id='183'>we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your</span><br/>
<span id='184'>head, and show the world what the bird hath done to</span><br/>
<span id='185'>her own nest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou</span><br/>
<span id='187'>didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But</span><br/>
<span id='188'>it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown</span><br/>
<span id='189'>bottom, like the bay of Portugal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour</span><br/>
<span id='191'>affection in, it runs out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot</span><br/>
<span id='193'>of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes</span><br/>
<span id='195'>because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I</span><br/>
<span id='196'>am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out</span><br/>
<span id='197'>of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and</span><br/>
<span id='198'>sigh till he come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>And I'll sleep.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<span id='3'>I have awhile given truce unto my wars,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To do my duty to my sovereign:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>In sign, whereof, this arm, that hath reclaim'd</span><br/>
<span id='6'>To your obedience fifty fortresses,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Lets fall his sword before your highness' feet,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And with submissive loyalty of heart</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Ascribes the glory of his conquest got</span><br/>
<span id='12'>First to my God and next unto your grace.</span><br/>

<span id='13'>Is this the Lord Talbot, uncle Gloucester,</span><br/>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord!</span><br/>
<span id='17'>When I was young, as yet I am not old,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I do remember how my father said</span><br/>
<span id='19'>A stouter champion never handled sword.</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Long since we were resolved of your truth,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Your faithful service and your toil in war;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Yet never have you tasted our reward,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Or been reguerdon'd with so much as thanks,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Because till now we never saw your face:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Therefore, stand up; and, for these good deserts,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And in our coronation take your place.</span><br/>

<span id='28'>Now, sir, to you, that were so hot at sea,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Disgracing of these colours that I wear</span><br/>
<span id='30'>In honour of my noble Lord of York:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Darest thou maintain the former words thou spakest?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BASSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Yes, sir; as well as you dare patronage</span><br/>
<span id='33'>The envious barking of your saucy tongue</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BASSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Why, what is he? as good a man as York.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Hark ye; not so: in witness, take ye that.</span><br/>
<p><em>Strikes him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such</span><br/>
<span id='39'>That whoso draws a sword, 'tis present death,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>But I'll unto his majesty, and crave</span><br/>
<span id='42'>I may have liberty to venge this wrong;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>When thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost.</span><br/>

<h1>Henry IV, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h4>Induction</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Warkworth. Before the castle</em>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<em>Enter RUMOUR, painted full of tongues</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>RUMOUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Open your ears; for which of you will stop</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?</span><br/>
<span id='3'>I, from the orient to the drooping west,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold</span><br/>
<span id='5'>The acts commenced on this ball of earth:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>The which in every language I pronounce,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>I speak of peace, while covert enmity</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Under the smile of safety wounds the world:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And who but Rumour, who but only I,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Make fearful musters and prepared defence,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And of so easy and so plain a stop</span><br/>
<span id='18'>That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>The still-discordant wavering multitude,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Can play upon it. But what need I thus</span><br/>
<span id='21'>My well-known body to anatomize</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Among my household? Why is Rumour here?</span><br/>
<span id='23'>I run before King Harry's victory;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Quenching the flame of bold rebellion</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Even with the rebel's blood. But what mean I</span><br/>
<span id='28'>To speak so true at first? my office is</span><br/>
<span id='29'>To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And that the king before the Douglas' rage</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Between that royal field of Shrewsbury</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And not a man of them brings other news</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Than they have learn'd of me: from Rumour's tongues</span><br/>
<span id='40'>They bring smooth comforts false, worse than</span><br/>
<span id='41'>true wrongs.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

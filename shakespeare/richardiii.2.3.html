<blockquote>
<em>Enter two Citizens meeting</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>I promise you, I scarcely know myself:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Hear you the news abroad?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Ay, that the king is dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter another Citizen</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Neighbours, God speed!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Give you good morrow, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>In him there is a hope of government,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>That in his nonage council under him,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And in his full and ripen'd years himself,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>So stood the state when Henry the Sixth</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>For then this land was famously enrich'd</span><br/>
<span id='22'>With politic grave counsel; then the king</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Better it were they all came by the father,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Or by the father there were none at all;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>For emulation now, who shall be nearest,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>This sickly land might solace as before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>All may be well; but, if God sort it so,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Ye cannot reason almost with a man</span><br/>
<span id='42'>That looks not heavily and full of fear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Before the times of change, still is it so:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see</span><br/>
<span id='46'>The waters swell before a boisterous storm.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>But leave it all to God. whither away?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Marry, we were sent for to the justices.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>And so was I: I'll bear you company.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

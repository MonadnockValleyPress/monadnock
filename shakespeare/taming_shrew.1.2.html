<h1>Taming of the Shrew</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Padua. Before Hortensio's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Verona, for a while I take my leave,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>To see my friends in Padua, but of all</span><br/>
<span id='3'>My best beloved and approved friend,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has</span><br/>
<span id='7'>rebused your worship?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that</span><br/>
<span id='10'>I should knock you here, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Villain, I say, knock me at this gate</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock</span><br/>
<span id='14'>you first,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And then I know after who comes by the worst.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Will it not be?</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.</span><br/>
<p><em>He wrings him by the ears</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Help, masters, help! my master is mad.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HORTENSIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!</span><br/>
<span id='22'>and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?</span><br/>
<span id='24'>'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor</span><br/>
<span id='26'>mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound</span><br/>
<span id='27'>this quarrel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his</span><br/>
<span id='30'>service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap</span><br/>
<span id='31'>him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to</span><br/>
<span id='32'>use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had</span><br/>
<span id='34'>well knock'd at first, then had not Grumio come by the worst.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>I bade the rascal knock upon your gate</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And could not get him for my heart to do it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these</span><br/>
<span id='39'>words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you</span><br/>
<span id='41'>now with, 'knocking at the gate'?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Such wind as scatters young men through the world,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>To seek their fortunes farther than at home</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Where small experience grows. But in a few,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Antonio, my father, is deceased;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And I have thrust myself into this maze,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And so am come abroad to see the world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And I'll not wish thee to her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know</span><br/>
<span id='65'>One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd</span><br/>
<span id='69'>As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>She moves me not, or not removes, at least,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Affection's edge in me, were she as rough</span><br/>
<span id='72'>As are the swelling Adriatic seas:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>If wealthily, then happily in Padua.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his</span><br/>
<span id='76'>mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to</span><br/>
<span id='77'>a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er</span><br/>
<span id='78'>a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases</span><br/>
<span id='79'>as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>so money comes withal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>I will continue that I broach'd in jest.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife</span><br/>
<span id='84'>With wealth enough and young and beauteous,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Her only fault, and that is faults enough,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Is that she is intolerable curst</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure</span><br/>
<span id='89'>That, were my state far worser than it is,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>I would not wed her for a mine of gold.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>For I will board her, though she chide as loud</span><br/>
<span id='94'>As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Her father is Baptista Minola,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>An affable and courteous gentleman:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Her name is Katharina Minola,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>I know her father, though I know not her;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And he knew my deceased father well.</span><br/>
<span id='101'>I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>And therefore let me be thus bold with you</span><br/>
<span id='103'>To give you over at this first encounter,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Unless you will accompany me thither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.</span><br/>
<span id='106'>O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she</span><br/>
<span id='107'>would think scolding would do little good upon him:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:</span><br/>
<span id='109'>why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in</span><br/>
<span id='110'>his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she</span><br/>
<span id='111'>stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in</span><br/>
<span id='112'>her face and so disfigure her with it that she</span><br/>
<span id='113'>shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>You know him not, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>He hath the jewel of my life in hold,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And her withholds from me and other more,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Suitors to her and rivals in my love,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Supposing it a thing impossible,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>For those defects I have before rehearsed,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>That ever Katharina will be woo'd;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>That none shall have access unto Bianca</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Katharina the curst!</span><br/>
<span id='128'>A title for a maid of all titles the worst.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And offer me disguised in sober robes</span><br/>
<span id='131'>To old Baptista as a schoolmaster</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>That so I may, by this device, at least</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Have leave and leisure to make love to her</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And unsuspected court her by herself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>how the young folks lay their heads together!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GREMIO, and LUCENTIO disguised</em></p>
<span id='138'>Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Petruchio, stand by a while.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>A proper stripling and an amorous!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>O, very well; I have perused the note.</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:</span><br/>
<span id='144'>All books of love, see that at any hand;</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And see you read no other lectures to her:</span><br/>
<span id='146'>You understand me: over and beside</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Signior Baptista's liberality,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>And let me have them very well perfumed</span><br/>
<span id='150'>For she is sweeter than perfume itself</span><br/>
<span id='151'>To whom they go to. What will you read to her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you</span><br/>
<span id='153'>As for my patron, stand you so assured,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>As firmly as yourself were still in place:</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Yea, and perhaps with more successful words</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>O this learning, what a thing it is!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>O this woodcock, what an ass it is!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Peace, sirrah!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.</span><br/>
<span id='163'>I promised to inquire carefully</span><br/>
<span id='164'>About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:</span><br/>
<span id='165'>And by good fortune I have lighted well</span><br/>
<span id='166'>On this young man, for learning and behavior</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Fit for her turn, well read in poetry</span><br/>
<span id='168'>And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Hath promised me to help me to another,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>A fine musician to instruct our mistress;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>So shall I no whit be behind in duty</span><br/>
<span id='173'>To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>And that his bags shall prove.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Upon agreement from us to his liking,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>So said, so done, is well.</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>I know she is an irksome brawling scold:</span><br/>
<span id='186'>If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:</span><br/>
<span id='189'>My father dead, my fortune lives for me;</span><br/>
<span id='190'>And I do hope good days and long to see.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!</span><br/>
<span id='192'>But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:</span><br/>
<span id='193'>You shall have me assisting you in all.</span><br/>
<span id='194'>But will you woo this wild-cat?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>Will I live?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>Why came I hither but to that intent?</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Have I not in my time heard lions roar?</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Have I not in a pitched battle heard</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?</span><br/>
<span id='206'>And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>That gives not half so great a blow to hear</span><br/>
<span id='208'>As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>For he fears none.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='211'>Hortensio, hark:</span><br/>
<span id='212'>This gentleman is happily arrived,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>I promised we would be contributors</span><br/>
<span id='215'>And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>And so we will, provided that he win her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>GRUMIO</strong></span>

<span id='217'>I would I were as sure of a good dinner.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter TRANIO brave, and BIONDELLO</em></p>

<span id='222'>Even he, Biondello.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>

<span id='speech61'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>

<span id='224'>Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>

<span id='225'>Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.</span><br/>

<span id='speech65'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>

<span id='230'>And if I be, sir, is it any offence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>

<span id='231'>No; if without more words you will get you hence.</span><br/>

<span id='speech68'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>

<span id='235'>For what reason, I beseech you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='236'>For this reason, if you'll know,</span><br/>

<span id='238'>That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.</span><br/>

<span id='247'>And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,</span><br/>
<span id='248'>Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.</span><br/>

<span id='speech74'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='249'>What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='250'>Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='251'>Hortensio, to what end are all these words?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='252'>Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,</span><br/>
<span id='253'>Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='254'>No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,</span><br/>
<span id='255'>The one as famous for a scolding tongue</span><br/>
<span id='256'>As is the other for beauteous modesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='257'>Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='258'>Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;</span><br/>
<span id='259'>And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='260'>Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:</span><br/>
<span id='261'>The youngest daughter whom you hearken for</span><br/>
<span id='262'>Her father keeps from all access of suitors,</span><br/>
<span id='263'>And will not promise her to any man</span><br/>
<span id='264'>Until the elder sister first be wed:</span><br/>
<span id='265'>The younger then is free and not before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='266'>If it be so, sir, that you are the man</span><br/>
<span id='267'>Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,</span><br/>
<span id='268'>And if you break the ice and do this feat,</span><br/>
<span id='269'>Achieve the elder, set the younger free</span><br/>
<span id='270'>For our access, whose hap shall be to have her</span><br/>
<span id='271'>Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='272'>Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;</span><br/>
<span id='273'>And since you do profess to be a suitor,</span><br/>
<span id='274'>You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,</span><br/>
<span id='275'>To whom we all rest generally beholding.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='276'>Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,</span><br/>
<span id='277'>Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,</span><br/>
<span id='278'>And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,</span><br/>
<span id='279'>And do as adversaries do in law,</span><br/>
<span id='280'>Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.</span><br/>

<span id='speech85'><strong>GRUMIO and BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='281'>O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='282'>The motion's good indeed and be it so,</span><br/>
<span id='283'>Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.</span><br/>

<h1>The Merchant of Venice</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene VIII</h3>
<h4>Venice. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter SALARINO and SALANIO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SALARINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>With him is Gratiano gone along;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SALANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SALARINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>He came too late, the ship was under sail:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>But there the duke was given to understand</span><br/>
<span id='8'>That in a gondola were seen together</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Besides, Antonio certified the duke</span><br/>
<span id='11'>They were not with Bassanio in his ship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SALANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>I never heard a passion so confused,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>So strange, outrageous, and so variable,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!</span><br/>
<span id='18'>A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SALARINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SALANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Let good Antonio look he keep his day,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Or he shall pay for this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SALARINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Marry, well remember'd.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Who told me, in the narrow seas that part</span><br/>
<span id='30'>The French and English, there miscarried</span><br/>
<span id='31'>A vessel of our country richly fraught:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>I thought upon Antonio when he told me;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And wish'd in silence that it were not his.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SALANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SALARINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Bassanio told him he would make some speed</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio</span><br/>
<span id='41'>But stay the very riping of the time;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Let it not enter in your mind of love:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='45'>To courtship and such fair ostents of love</span><br/>
<span id='46'>As shall conveniently become you there:'</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And even there, his eye being big with tears,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And with affection wondrous sensible</span><br/>
<span id='50'>He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SALANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>I think he only loves the world for him.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>I pray thee, let us go and find him out</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And quicken his embraced heaviness</span><br/>
<span id='54'>With some delight or other.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SALARINO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Do we so.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

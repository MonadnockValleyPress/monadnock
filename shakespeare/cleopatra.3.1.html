<h1>Antony and Cleopatra</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>A plain in Syria.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS,  and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead body of PACORUS borne before him</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>VENTIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Pays this for Marcus Crassus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SILIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Noble Ventidius,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither</span><br/>
<span id='10'>The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Put garlands on thy head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>VENTIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>O Silius, Silius,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>I have done enough; a lower place, note well,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Better to leave undone, than by our deed</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Caesar and Antony have ever won</span><br/>
<span id='19'>More in their officer than person: Sossius,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>For quick accumulation of renown,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Who does i' the wars more than his captain can</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Than gain which darkens him.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>I could do more to do Antonius good,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>But 'twould offend him; and in his offence</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Should my performance perish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SILIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Thou hast, Ventidius,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>that</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Without the which a soldier, and his sword,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>VENTIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>I'll humbly signify what in his name,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>That magical word of war, we have effected;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia</span><br/>
<span id='38'>We have jaded out o' the field.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SILIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Where is he now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>VENTIDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste</span><br/>
<span id='41'>The weight we must convey with's will permit,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

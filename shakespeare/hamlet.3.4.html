<h4>Scene IV. The Queen's closet.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter QUEEN MARGARET and POLONIUS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Pray you, be round with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>[Within]  Mother, mother, mother!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>I'll warrant you,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.</span><br/>
<p><em>POLONIUS hides behind the arras</em></p>
<p><em>Enter HAMLET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Now, mother, what's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Mother, you have my father much offended.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Why, how now, Hamlet!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>What's the matter now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Have you forgot me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>No, by the rood, not so:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And&mdash;would it were not so!&mdash;you are my mother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>You go not till I set you up a glass</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Where you may see the inmost part of you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Help, help, ho!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>[Behind]  What, ho! help, help, help!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>[Drawing]  How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!</span><br/>
<p><em>Makes a pass through the arras</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>[Behind]  O, I am slain!</span><br/>
<p><em>Falls and dies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>O me, what hast thou done?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Nay, I know not:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Is it the king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>As kill a king, and marry with his brother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>As kill a king!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>                  Ay, lady, 'twas my word.</span><br/>
<p><em>Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS</em></p>
<span id='37'>Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!</span><br/>
<span id='38'>I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>If it be made of penetrable stuff,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>If damned custom have not brass'd it so</span><br/>
<span id='44'>That it is proof and bulwark against sense.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue</span><br/>
<span id='46'>In noise so rude against me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Such an act</span><br/>
<span id='48'>That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose</span><br/>
<span id='50'>From the fair forehead of an innocent love</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows</span><br/>
<span id='52'>As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed</span><br/>
<span id='53'>As from the body of contraction plucks</span><br/>
<span id='54'>The very soul, and sweet religion makes</span><br/>
<span id='55'>A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Yea, this solidity and compound mass,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>With tristful visage, as against the doom,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Is thought-sick at the act.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Ay me, what act,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Look here, upon this picture, and on this,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>See, what a grace was seated on this brow;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>A station like the herald Mercury</span><br/>
<span id='67'>New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>A combination and a form indeed,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Where every god did seem to set his seal,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>To give the world assurance of a man:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?</span><br/>
<span id='76'>You cannot call it love; for at your age</span><br/>
<span id='77'>The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd</span><br/>
<span id='83'>But it reserved some quantity of choice,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To serve in such a difference. What devil was't</span><br/>
<span id='85'>That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Or but a sickly part of one true sense</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Could not so mope.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame</span><br/>
<span id='94'>When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Since frost itself as actively doth burn</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And reason panders will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>O Hamlet, speak no more:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And there I see such black and grained spots</span><br/>
<span id='100'>As will not leave their tinct.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Nay, but to live</span><br/>
<span id='102'>In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Over the nasty sty,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>O, speak to me no more;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>No more, sweet Hamlet!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>A murderer and a villain;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>And put it in his pocket!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>No more!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>A king of shreds and patches,&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Ghost</em></p>
<span id='116'>Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Alas, he's mad!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Do you not come your tardy son to chide,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by</span><br/>
<span id='121'>The important acting of your dread command? O, say!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Ghost</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Do not forget: this visitation</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.</span><br/>
<span id='124'>But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>O, step between her and her fighting soul:</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Speak to her, Hamlet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>How is it with you, lady?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Alas, how is't with you,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>That you do bend your eye on vacancy</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!</span><br/>
<span id='139'>His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Lest with this piteous action you convert</span><br/>
<span id='142'>My stern effects: then what I have to do</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>To whom do you speak this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Do you see nothing there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Nor did you nothing hear?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>No, nothing but ourselves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!</span><br/>
<span id='150'>My father, in his habit as he lived!</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Ghost</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>This the very coinage of your brain:</span><br/>
<span id='153'>This bodiless creation ecstasy</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Is very cunning in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>Ecstasy!</span><br/>
<span id='156'>My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>And makes as healthful music: it is not madness</span><br/>
<span id='158'>That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And I the matter will re-word; which madness</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:</span><br/>
<span id='163'>It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>And do not spread the compost on the weeds,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>For in the fatness of these pursy times</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>O, throw away the worser part of it,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>And live the purer with the other half.</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Assume a virtue, if you have it not.</span><br/>
<span id='177'>That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>That to the use of actions fair and good</span><br/>
<span id='180'>He likewise gives a frock or livery,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>And that shall lend a kind of easiness</span><br/>
<span id='183'>To the next abstinence: the next more easy;</span><br/>
<span id='184'>For use almost can change the stamp of nature,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>And either [         ] the devil, or throw him out</span><br/>
<span id='186'>With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:</span><br/>
<span id='187'>And when you are desirous to be bless'd,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,</span><br/>
<p><em>Pointing to POLONIUS</em></p>
<span id='189'>I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>To punish me with this and this with me,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>That I must be their scourge and minister.</span><br/>
<span id='192'>I will bestow him, and will answer well</span><br/>
<span id='193'>The death I gave him. So, again, good night.</span><br/>
<span id='194'>I must be cruel, only to be kind:</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.</span><br/>
<span id='196'>One word more, good lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>What shall I do?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;</span><br/>
<span id='201'>And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Make you to ravel all this matter out,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>That I essentially am not in madness,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;</span><br/>
<span id='206'>For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?</span><br/>
<span id='209'>No, in despite of sense and secrecy,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Unpeg the basket on the house's top.</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,</span><br/>
<span id='212'>To try conclusions, in the basket creep,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>And break your own neck down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>And breath of life, I have no life to breathe</span><br/>
<span id='216'>What thou hast said to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>I must to England; you know that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>Alack,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='220'>There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,</span><br/>
<span id='221'>Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,</span><br/>
<span id='222'>They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,</span><br/>
<span id='223'>And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;</span><br/>
<span id='224'>For 'tis the sport to have the engineer</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard</span><br/>
<span id='226'>But I will delve one yard below their mines,</span><br/>
<span id='227'>And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,</span><br/>
<span id='228'>When in one line two crafts directly meet.</span><br/>
<span id='229'>This man shall set me packing:</span><br/>
<span id='230'>I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor</span><br/>
<span id='232'>Is now most still, most secret and most grave,</span><br/>
<span id='233'>Who was in life a foolish prating knave.</span><br/>
<span id='234'>Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.</span><br/>
<span id='235'>Good night, mother.</span><br/>

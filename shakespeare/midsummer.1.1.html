<h1>A Midsummer Night's Dream</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Athens. The palace of Theseus.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>THESEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Draws on apace; four happy days bring in</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow</span><br/>
<span id='4'>This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Like to a step-dame or a dowager</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Long withering out a young man revenue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>HIPPOLYTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Four nights will quickly dream away the time;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And then the moon, like to a silver bow</span><br/>
<span id='10'>New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Of our solemnities.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>THESEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Go, Philostrate,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Turn melancholy forth to funerals;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The pale companion is not for our pomp.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit PHILOSTRATE</em></p>
<span id='17'>Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And won thy love, doing thee injuries;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>But I will wed thee in another key,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>EGEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>THESEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>EGEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Full of vexation come I, with complaint</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Against my child, my daughter Hermia.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>This man hath my consent to marry her.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And interchanged love-tokens with my child:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>With feigning voice verses of feigning love,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And stolen the impression of her fantasy</span><br/>
<span id='34'>With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Be it so she; will not here before your grace</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Consent to marry with Demetrius,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>As she is mine, I may dispose of her:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Which shall be either to this gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Or to her death, according to our law</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Immediately provided in that case.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>THESEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>To you your father should be as a god;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>One that composed your beauties, yea, and one</span><br/>
<span id='50'>To whom you are but as a form in wax</span><br/>
<span id='51'>By him imprinted and within his power</span><br/>
<span id='52'>To leave the figure or disfigure it.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HERMIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>So is Lysander.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>THESEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>                  In himself he is;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>The other must be held the worthier.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HERMIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>I would my father look'd but with my eyes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>THESEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>HERMIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>I do entreat your grace to pardon me.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>I know not by what power I am made bold,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Nor how it may concern my modesty,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>But I beseech your grace that I may know</span><br/>
<span id='65'>The worst that may befall me in this case,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>THESEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Either to die the death or to abjure</span><br/>
<span id='68'>For ever the society of men.</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Know of your youth, examine well your blood,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>You can endure the livery of a nun,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>To live a barren sister all your life,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Than that which withering on the virgin thorn</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HERMIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Ere I will my virgin patent up</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke</span><br/>
<span id='84'>My soul consents not to give sovereignty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>THESEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Take time to pause; and, by the next new moon&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>For everlasting bond of fellowship&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Upon that day either prepare to die</span><br/>
<span id='89'>For disobedience to your father's will,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Or on Diana's altar to protest</span><br/>
<span id='92'>For aye austerity and single life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Thy crazed title to my certain right.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>You have her father's love, Demetrius;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>EGEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And what is mine my love shall render him.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And she is mine, and all my right of her</span><br/>
<span id='100'>I do estate unto Demetrius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>I am, my lord, as well derived as he,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>As well possess'd; my love is more than his;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>If not with vantage, as Demetrius';</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And, which is more than all these boasts can be,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Why should not I then prosecute my right?</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Upon this spotted and inconstant man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>THESEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>I must confess that I have heard so much,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>But, being over-full of self-affairs,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>I have some private schooling for you both.</span><br/>
<span id='119'>For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself</span><br/>
<span id='120'>To fit your fancies to your father's will;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Or else the law of Athens yields you up&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Which by no means we may extenuate&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>To death, or to a vow of single life.</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Demetrius and Egeus, go along:</span><br/>
<span id='126'>I must employ you in some business</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Against our nuptial and confer with you</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>EGEUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>With duty and desire we follow you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?</span><br/>
<span id='131'>How chance the roses there do fade so fast?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HERMIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Belike for want of rain, which I could well</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Could ever hear by tale or history,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>The course of true love never did run smooth;</span><br/>
<span id='137'>But, either it was different in blood,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>HERMIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Or else misgraffed in respect of years,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HERMIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>O spite! too old to be engaged to young.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>HERMIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Making it momentany as a sound,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Brief as the lightning in the collied night,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'</span><br/>
<span id='150'>The jaws of darkness do devour it up:</span><br/>
<span id='151'>So quick bright things come to confusion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>HERMIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>It stands as an edict in destiny:</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Then let us teach our trial patience,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Because it is a customary cross,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.</span><br/>
<span id='159'>I have a widow aunt, a dowager</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Of great revenue, and she hath no child:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;</span><br/>
<span id='162'>And she respects me as her only son.</span><br/>
<span id='163'>There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;</span><br/>
<span id='164'>And to that place the sharp Athenian law</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>And in the wood, a league without the town,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Where I did meet thee once with Helena,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>To do observance to a morn of May,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>There will I stay for thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>HERMIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>My good Lysander!</span><br/>
<span id='172'>I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>By his best arrow with the golden head,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>By the simplicity of Venus' doves,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>When the false Troyan under sail was seen,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>By all the vows that ever men have broke,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>In number more than ever women spoke,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>In that same place thou hast appointed me,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HELENA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>HERMIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>God speed fair Helena! whither away?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air</span><br/>
<span id='187'>More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;</span><br/>
<span id='191'>My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>The rest I'd give to be to you translated.</span><br/>
<span id='195'>O, teach me how you look, and with what art</span><br/>
<span id='196'>You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>HERMIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>HERMIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>I give him curses, yet he gives me love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>O that my prayers could such affection move!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HERMIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>The more I hate, the more he follows me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>The more I love, the more he hateth me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HERMIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>HERMIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Lysander and myself will fly this place.</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Before the time I did Lysander see,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:</span><br/>
<span id='209'>O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='211'>Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:</span><br/>
<span id='212'>To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold</span><br/>
<span id='213'>Her silver visage in the watery glass,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>HERMIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>And in the wood, where often you and I</span><br/>
<span id='218'>Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,</span><br/>
<span id='220'>There my Lysander and myself shall meet;</span><br/>
<span id='221'>And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='222'>To seek new friends and stranger companies.</span><br/>
<span id='223'>Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;</span><br/>
<span id='224'>And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight</span><br/>
<span id='226'>From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LYSANDER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='227'>I will, my Hermia.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit HERMIA</em></p>
<span id='228'>Helena, adieu:</span><br/>
<span id='229'>As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='230'>How happy some o'er other some can be!</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.</span><br/>
<span id='232'>But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;</span><br/>
<span id='233'>He will not know what all but he do know:</span><br/>
<span id='234'>And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>So I, admiring of his qualities:</span><br/>
<span id='236'>Things base and vile, folding no quantity,</span><br/>
<span id='237'>Love can transpose to form and dignity:</span><br/>
<span id='238'>Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;</span><br/>
<span id='239'>And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:</span><br/>
<span id='240'>Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;</span><br/>
<span id='241'>Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:</span><br/>
<span id='242'>And therefore is Love said to be a child,</span><br/>
<span id='243'>Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.</span><br/>
<span id='244'>As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,</span><br/>
<span id='245'>So the boy Love is perjured every where:</span><br/>
<span id='246'>For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,</span><br/>
<span id='247'>He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;</span><br/>
<span id='248'>And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,</span><br/>
<span id='249'>So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.</span><br/>
<span id='250'>I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:</span><br/>
<span id='251'>Then to the wood will he to-morrow night</span><br/>
<span id='252'>Pursue her; and for this intelligence</span><br/>
<span id='253'>If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:</span><br/>
<span id='254'>But herein mean I to enrich my pain,</span><br/>
<span id='255'>To have his sight thither and back again.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

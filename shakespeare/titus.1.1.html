<h1>Titus Andronicus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Rome. Before the Capitol.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>The Tomb of the ANDRONICI appearing; the Tribunes  and Senators aloft. Enter, below, from one side,  SATURNINUS and his Followers; and, from the other side, BASSIANUS and his Followers; with drum and colours</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Noble patricians, patrons of my right,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Defend the justice of my cause with arms,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And, countrymen, my loving followers,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Plead my successive title with your swords:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I am his first-born son, that was the last</span><br/>
<span id='6'>That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Then let my father's honours live in me,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BASSIANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Keep then this passage to the Capitol</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And suffer not dishonour to approach</span><br/>
<span id='14'>The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>To justice, continence and nobility;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>But let desert in pure election shine,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS, aloft, with the crown</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Princes, that strive by factions and by friends</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Ambitiously for rule and empery,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand</span><br/>
<span id='21'>A special party, have, by common voice,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>In election for the Roman empery,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius</span><br/>
<span id='24'>For many good and great deserts to Rome:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>A nobler man, a braver warrior,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Lives not this day within the city walls:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>He by the senate is accit'd home</span><br/>
<span id='28'>From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Ten years are spent since first he undertook</span><br/>
<span id='32'>This cause of Rome and chastised with arms</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons</span><br/>
<span id='35'>In coffins from the field;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And now at last, laden with honour's spoils,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Let us entreat, by honour of his name,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Whom worthily you would have now succeed.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And in the Capitol and senate's right,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Whom you pretend to honour and adore,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>That you withdraw you and abate your strength;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.</span><br/>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>

<span id='46'>How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BASSIANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Marcus Andronicus, so I do ally</span><br/>

<span id='51'>And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>That I will here dismiss my loving friends,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And to my fortunes and the people's favor</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SATURNINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>I thank you all and here dismiss you all,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And to the love and favor of my country</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Commit myself, my person and the cause.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt the followers of SATURNINUS</em></p>
<span id='60'>Rome, be as just and gracious unto me</span><br/>
<span id='61'>As I am confident and kind to thee.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Open the gates, and let me in.</span><br/>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BASSIANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish. SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS go up into the Capitol</em></p>
<p><em>Enter a Captain</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Captain</strong></span>

<span id='66'>Successful in the battles that he fights,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>With honour and with fortune is return'd</span><br/>
<span id='68'>From where he circumscribed with his sword,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.</span><br/>
<p><em>Drums and trumpets sounded. Enter MARTIUS and  MUTIUS; after them, two Men bearing a coffin  covered with black; then LUCIUS and QUINTUS. After  them, TITUS ANDRONICUS; and then TAMORA, with  ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, AARON, and other Goths,  prisoners; Soldiers and people following. The Bearers set down the coffin, and TITUS speaks</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Returns with precious jading to the bay</span><br/>
<span id='73'>From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>To re-salute his country with his tears,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Thou great defender of this Capitol,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Half of the number that King Priam had,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!</span><br/>
<span id='82'>These that survive let Rome reward with love;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>These that I bring unto their latest home,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>With burial amongst their ancestors:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Make way to lay them by their brethren.</span><br/>
<p><em>The tomb is opened</em></p>
<span id='90'>There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!</span><br/>
<span id='92'>O sacred receptacle of my joys,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>How many sons of mine hast thou in store,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>That thou wilt never render to me more!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Before this earthy prison of their bones;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>That so the shadows be not unappeased,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>I give him you, the noblest that survives,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>The eldest son of this distressed queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>

<span id='104'>Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>A mother's tears in passion for her son:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>O, think my son to be as dear to me!</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>To beautify thy triumphs and return,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>For valiant doings in their country's cause?</span><br/>
<span id='114'>O, if to fight for king and commonweal</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Were piety in thine, it is in these.</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Draw near them then in being merciful:</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Thrice noble Titus, spare my first-born son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>TITUS ANDRONICUS</strong></span>

<span id='124'>Religiously they ask a sacrifice:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>To this your son is mark'd, and die he must,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.</span><br/>

<p><em>Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS, and MUTIUS, with ALARBUS</em></p>

<span id='133'>Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive</span><br/>
<span id='134'>To tremble under Titus' threatening looks.</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal</span><br/>
<span id='136'>The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy</span><br/>
<span id='137'>With opportunity of sharp revenge</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>May favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='140'>When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS and MUTIUS, with their swords bloody</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>See, lord and father, how we have perform'd</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,</span><br/>

<span id='146'>Remaineth nought, but to inter our brethren,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so</span><br/>
<span id='3'>To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh</span><br/>
<span id='6'>From the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Beyond self-explication: put thyself</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with</span><br/>
<span id='12'>A look untender? If't be summer news,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st</span><br/>
<span id='14'>But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!</span><br/>
<span id='15'>That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue</span><br/>
<span id='17'>May take off some extremity, which to read</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Would be even mortal to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Please you, read;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing</span><br/>
<span id='21'>The most disdain'd of fortune.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>[Reads]  'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the</span><br/>
<span id='23'>strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie</span><br/>
<span id='24'>bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain</span><br/>
<span id='26'>as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with</span><br/>
<span id='28'>the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away</span><br/>
<span id='29'>her life: I shall give thee opportunity at</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose</span><br/>
<span id='31'>where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain</span><br/>
<span id='32'>it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and</span><br/>
<span id='33'>equally to me disloyal.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Rides on the posting winds and doth belie</span><br/>
<span id='39'>All corners of the world: kings, queens and states,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave</span><br/>
<span id='41'>This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>False to his bed! What is it to be false?</span><br/>
<span id='43'>To lie in watch there and to think on him?</span><br/>
<span id='44'>To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep</span><br/>
<span id='45'>charge nature,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>To break it with a fearful dream of him</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Alas, good lady!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>I must be ripp'd:&mdash;to pieces with me!&mdash;O,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Put on for villany; not born where't grows,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>But worn a bait for ladies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Good madam, hear me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity</span><br/>
<span id='65'>From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured</span><br/>
<span id='68'>From thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>A little witness my obedience: look!</span><br/>
<span id='71'>I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit</span><br/>
<span id='72'>The innocent mansion of my love, my heart;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Thy master is not there, who was indeed</span><br/>
<span id='75'>The riches of it: do his bidding; strike</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>But now thou seem'st a coward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Hence, vile instrument!</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Thou shalt not damn my hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Why, I must die;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And if I do not by thy hand, thou art</span><br/>
<span id='82'>No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter</span><br/>
<span id='83'>There is a prohibition so divine</span><br/>
<span id='84'>That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?</span><br/>
<span id='87'>The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Believe false teachers: though those that</span><br/>
<span id='92'>are betray'd</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Stands in worse case of woe.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up</span><br/>
<span id='96'>My disobedience 'gainst the king my father</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And make me put into contempt the suits</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find</span><br/>
<span id='99'>It is no act of common passage, but</span><br/>
<span id='100'>A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself</span><br/>
<span id='101'>To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her</span><br/>
<span id='102'>That now thou tirest on, how thy memory</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>When I desire it too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>O gracious lady,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Since I received command to do this business</span><br/>
<span id='109'>I have not slept one wink.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Do't, and to bed then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Wherefore then</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused</span><br/>
<span id='114'>So many miles with a pretence? this place?</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?</span><br/>
<span id='116'>The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>For my being absent? whereunto I never</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>The elected deer before thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>But to win time</span><br/>
<span id='122'>To lose so bad employment; in the which</span><br/>
<span id='123'>I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Hear me with patience.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Talk thy tongue weary; speak:</span><br/>
<span id='126'>I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Then, madam,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>I thought you would not back again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Most like;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Bringing me here to kill me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Not so, neither:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>But if I were as wise as honest, then</span><br/>
<span id='135'>My purpose would prove well. It cannot be</span><br/>
<span id='136'>But that my master is abused:</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Hath done you both this cursed injury.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Some Roman courtezan.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>No, on my life.</span><br/>
<span id='141'>I'll give but notice you are dead and send him</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded</span><br/>
<span id='143'>I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>And that will well confirm it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Why good fellow,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Or in my life what comfort, when I am</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Dead to my husband?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>If you'll back to the court&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>No court, no father; nor no more ado</span><br/>
<span id='151'>With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me</span><br/>
<span id='153'>As fearful as a siege.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>If not at court,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Then not in Britain must you bide.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Where then</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think</span><br/>
<span id='161'>There's livers out of Britain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>I am most glad</span><br/>
<span id='163'>You think of other place. The ambassador,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven</span><br/>
<span id='165'>To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise</span><br/>
<span id='167'>That which, to appear itself, must not yet be</span><br/>
<span id='168'>But by self-danger, you should tread a course</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near</span><br/>
<span id='170'>The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least</span><br/>
<span id='171'>That though his actions were not visible, yet</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Report should render him hourly to your ear</span><br/>
<span id='173'>As truly as he moves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>O, for such means!</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>I would adventure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>Well, then, here's the point:</span><br/>
<span id='178'>You must forget to be a woman; change</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Command into obedience: fear and niceness&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='180'>The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Woman its pretty self&mdash;into a waggish courage:</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and</span><br/>
<span id='183'>As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Exposing it&mdash;but, O, the harder heart!</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Alack, no remedy!&mdash;to the greedy touch</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Of common-kissing Titan, and forget</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein</span><br/>
<span id='189'>You made great Juno angry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>Nay, be brief</span><br/>
<span id='191'>I see into thy end, and am almost</span><br/>
<span id='192'>A man already.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>First, make yourself but like one.</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Fore-thinking this, I have already fit&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='195'>'Tis in my cloak-bag&mdash;doublet, hat, hose, all</span><br/>
<span id='196'>That answer to them: would you in their serving,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>And with what imitation you can borrow</span><br/>
<span id='198'>From youth of such a season, 'fore noble Lucius</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Present yourself, desire his service, tell him</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Wherein you're happy,&mdash;which you'll make him know,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>If that his head have ear in music,&mdash;doubtless</span><br/>
<span id='202'>With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable</span><br/>
<span id='203'>And doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>You have me, rich; and I will never fail</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Beginning nor supplyment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>Thou art all the comfort</span><br/>
<span id='207'>The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:</span><br/>
<span id='208'>There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even</span><br/>
<span id='209'>All that good time will give us: this attempt</span><br/>
<span id='210'>I am soldier to, and will abide it with</span><br/>
<span id='211'>A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='212'>Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Here is a box; I had it from the queen:</span><br/>
<span id='216'>What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,</span><br/>
<span id='217'>Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this</span><br/>
<span id='218'>Will drive away distemper. To some shade,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>And fit you to your manhood. May the gods</span><br/>
<span id='220'>Direct you to the best!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>Amen: I thank thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt, severally</em></p>

<h1>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Ephesus. A room in Cerimon's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CERIMON and THAISA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CERIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Madam, this letter, and some certain jewels,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Lay with you in your coffer: which are now</span><br/>
<span id='3'>At your command. Know you the character?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>It is my lord's.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>That I was shipp'd at sea, I well remember,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Even on my eaning time; but whether there</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Deliver'd, by the holy gods,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>I cannot rightly say. But since King Pericles,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>My wedded lord, I ne'er shall see again,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>A vestal livery will I take me to,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And never more have joy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CERIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Madam, if this you purpose as ye speak,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Diana's temple is not distant far,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Where you may abide till your date expire.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Moreover, if you please, a niece of mine</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Shall there attend you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>My recompense is thanks, that's all;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GOWER</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>GOWER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Welcomed and settled to his own desire.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Unto Diana there a votaress.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Now to Marina bend your mind,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Whom our fast-growing scene must find</span><br/>
<span id='25'>At Tarsus, and by Cleon train'd</span><br/>
<span id='26'>In music, letters; who hath gain'd</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Of education all the grace,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Which makes her both the heart and place</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Of general wonder. But, alack,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>That monster envy, oft the wrack</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Of earned praise, Marina's life</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Seeks to take off by treason's knife.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And in this kind hath our Cleon</span><br/>
<span id='34'>One daughter, and a wench full grown,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Hight Philoten: and it is said</span><br/>
<span id='37'>For certain in our story, she</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Would ever with Marina be:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Be't when she weaved the sleided silk</span><br/>
<span id='40'>With fingers long, small, white as milk;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Or when she would with sharp needle wound</span><br/>
<span id='42'>The cambric, which she made more sound</span><br/>
<span id='43'>By hurting it; or when to the lute</span><br/>
<span id='44'>She sung, and made the night-bird mute,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>That still records with moan; or when</span><br/>
<span id='46'>She would with rich and constant pen</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Vail to her mistress Dian; still</span><br/>
<span id='48'>This Philoten contends in skill</span><br/>
<span id='49'>With absolute Marina: so</span><br/>
<span id='50'>With the dove of Paphos might the crow</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Vie feathers white. Marina gets</span><br/>
<span id='52'>All praises, which are paid as debts,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And not as given. This so darks</span><br/>
<span id='54'>In Philoten all graceful marks,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>A present murderer does prepare</span><br/>
<span id='57'>For good Marina, that her daughter</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Might stand peerless by this slaughter.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And cursed Dionyza hath</span><br/>
<span id='62'>The pregnant instrument of wrath</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Prest for this blow. The unborn event</span><br/>
<span id='64'>I do commend to your content:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Only I carry winged time</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Post on the lame feet of my rhyme;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Which never could I so convey,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Unless your thoughts went on my way.</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Dionyza does appear,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>With Leonine, a murderer.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

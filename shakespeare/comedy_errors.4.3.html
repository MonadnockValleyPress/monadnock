<em>Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>There's not a man I meet but doth salute me</span><br/>
<span id='3'>As if I were their well-acquainted friend;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And every one doth call me by my name.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Some tender money to me; some invite me;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Some offer me commodities to buy:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And therewithal took measure of my body.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Sure, these are but imaginary wiles</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Master, here's the gold you sent me for. What, have</span><br/>
<span id='14'>you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam</span><br/>
<span id='18'>that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's</span><br/>
<span id='19'>skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came</span><br/>
<span id='20'>behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you</span><br/>
<span id='21'>forsake your liberty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>I understand thee not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a</span><br/>
<span id='25'>bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob</span><br/>
<span id='27'>and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed</span><br/>
<span id='28'>men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up</span><br/>
<span id='29'>his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a</span><br/>
<span id='30'>morris-pike.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>What, thou meanest an officer?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that brings</span><br/>
<span id='34'>any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that</span><br/>
<span id='35'>thinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'God</span><br/>
<span id='36'>give you good rest!'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the</span><br/>
<span id='40'>bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were</span><br/>
<span id='41'>you hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoy</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to</span><br/>
<span id='43'>deliver you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>The fellow is distract, and so am I;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And here we wander in illusions:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Some blessed power deliver us from hence!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Courtezan</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>COURTEZAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Is that the chain you promised me to-day?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Master, is this Mistress Satan?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>It is the devil.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and here</span><br/>
<span id='57'>she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof</span><br/>
<span id='58'>comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's as</span><br/>
<span id='59'>much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is</span><br/>
<span id='60'>written, they appear to men like angels of light:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>COURTEZAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak a</span><br/>
<span id='66'>long spoon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Why, Dromio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with</span><br/>
<span id='70'>the devil.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>COURTEZAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>A nut, a cherry-stone;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>But she, more covetous, would have a chain.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Master, be wise: an if you give it her,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>COURTEZAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>COURTEZAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Else would he never so demean himself.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And for the same he promised me a chain:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Both one and other he denies me now.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>The reason that I gather he is mad,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Besides this present instance of his rage,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>On purpose shut the doors against his way.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>My way is now to hie home to his house,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And tell his wife that, being lunatic,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>He rush'd into my house and took perforce</span><br/>
<span id='103'>My ring away. This course I fittest choose;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>For forty ducats is too much to lose.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<h4>Scene I. A room in the castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Where is your son?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Bestow this place on us a little while.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</em></p>
<span id='5'>Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Behind the arras hearing something stir,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And, in this brainish apprehension, kills</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The unseen good old man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>O heavy deed!</span><br/>
<span id='14'>It had been so with us, had we been there:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>His liberty is full of threats to all;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>To you yourself, to us, to every one.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?</span><br/>
<span id='18'>It will be laid to us, whose providence</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>This mad young man: but so much was our love,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>We would not understand what was most fit;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>But, like the owner of a foul disease,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To keep it from divulging, let it feed</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>O'er whom his very madness, like some ore</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Among a mineral of metals base,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>O Gertrude, come away!</span><br/>
<span id='30'>The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed</span><br/>
<span id='32'>We must, with all our majesty and skill,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</em></p>
<span id='34'>Friends both, go join you with some further aid:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</em></p>
<span id='39'>Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And let them know, both what we mean to do,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And what's untimely done. O, come away!</span><br/>
<span id='42'>My soul is full of discord and dismay.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

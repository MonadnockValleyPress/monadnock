<h1>Cymbeline</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Imogen's bedchamber in Cymbeline's palace: a trunk in one corner of it.</h4>

<blockquote>
<p><em>IMOGEN in bed, reading; a Lady attending</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Who's there? my woman Helen?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Please you, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>What hour is it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>                  Almost midnight, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Take not away the taper, leave it burning;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>I prithee, call me. Sleep hath seized me wholly.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Lady</em></p>
<span id='10'>To your protection I commend me, gods.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>From fairies and the tempters of the night</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Guard me, beseech ye.</span><br/>
<p><em>Sleeps. IACHIMO comes from the trunk</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!</span><br/>
<span id='19'>But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To see the enclosed lights, now canopied</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Under these windows, white and azure laced</span><br/>
<span id='25'>With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>To note the chamber: I will write all down:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Such and such pictures; there the window; such</span><br/>
<span id='28'>The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Ah, but some natural notes about her body,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Above ten thousand meaner moveables</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And be her sense but as a monument,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:</span><br/>
<p><em>Taking off her bracelet</em></p>
<span id='36'>As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!</span><br/>
<span id='37'>'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>As strongly as the conscience does within,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To the madding of her lord. On her left breast</span><br/>
<span id='40'>A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops</span><br/>
<span id='41'>I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Stronger than ever law could make: this secret</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en</span><br/>
<span id='44'>The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Why should I write this down, that's riveted,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late</span><br/>
<span id='47'>The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning</span><br/>
<span id='51'>May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.</span><br/>
<p><em>Clock strikes</em></p>
<span id='53'>One, two, three: time, time!</span><br/>
<p><em>Goes into the trunk. The scene closes</em></p>
</blockquote>

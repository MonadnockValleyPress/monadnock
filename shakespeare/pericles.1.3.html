<h1>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Tyre. An ante-chamber in the palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter THALIARD</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>THALIARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>So, this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I</span><br/>
<span id='2'>kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to</span><br/>
<span id='3'>be hanged at home: 'tis dangerous. Well, I perceive</span><br/>
<span id='4'>he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired</span><br/>
<span id='6'>he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he</span><br/>
<span id='7'>had some reason for't; for if a king bid a man be a</span><br/>
<span id='8'>villain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath to</span><br/>
<span id='9'>be one! Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES, with other Lords of Tyre</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Further to question me of your king's departure:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>His seal'd commission, left in trust with me,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>THALIARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>[Aside]  How! the king gone!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>If further yet you will be satisfied,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>He would depart, I'll give some light unto you.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Being at Antioch&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>THALIARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>[Aside]          What from Antioch?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Royal Antiochus&mdash;on what cause I know not&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Took some displeasure at him; at least he judged so:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To show his sorrow, he'ld correct himself;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>With whom each minute threatens life or death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>THALIARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>[Aside]  Well, I perceive</span><br/>
<span id='27'>I shall not be hang'd now, although I would;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>But since he's gone, the king's seas must please:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>He 'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>I'll present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>THALIARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>From him I come</span><br/>
<span id='33'>With message unto princely Pericles;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>But since my landing I have understood</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>My message must return from whence it came.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HELICANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>We have no reason to desire it,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Commended to our master, not to us:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Winter's Tale</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>A room in Leontes' palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LEONTES, CLEOMENES, DION, PAULINA, and Servants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CLEOMENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd</span><br/>
<span id='2'>A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down</span><br/>
<span id='4'>More penitence than done trespass: at the last,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>With them forgive yourself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Whilst I remember</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Her and her virtues, I cannot forget</span><br/>
<span id='9'>My blemishes in them, and so still think of</span><br/>
<span id='10'>The wrong I did myself; which was so much,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>That heirless it hath made my kingdom and</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Bred his hopes out of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>True, too true, my lord:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>If, one by one, you wedded all the world,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Or from the all that are took something good,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Would be unparallel'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>I think so. Kill'd!</span><br/>
<span id='20'>She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Say so but seldom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CLEOMENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>                  Not at all, good lady:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>You might have spoken a thousand things that would</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Have done the time more benefit and graced</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Your kindness better.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>You are one of those</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Would have him wed again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DION</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>If you would not so,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>You pity not the state, nor the remembrance</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Of his most sovereign name; consider little</span><br/>
<span id='33'>What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>May drop upon his kingdom and devour</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Incertain lookers on. What were more holy</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Than to rejoice the former queen is well?</span><br/>
<span id='37'>What holier than, for royalty's repair,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>For present comfort and for future good,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To bless the bed of majesty again</span><br/>
<span id='40'>With a sweet fellow to't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>There is none worthy,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>For has not the divine Apollo said,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Is't not the tenor of his oracle,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>That King Leontes shall not have an heir</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Is all as monstrous to our human reason</span><br/>
<span id='49'>As my Antigonus to break his grave</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And come again to me; who, on my life,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel</span><br/>
<span id='52'>My lord should to the heavens be contrary,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Oppose against their wills.</span><br/>
<p><em>To LEONTES</em></p>
<span id='54'>Care not for issue;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>The crown will find an heir: great Alexander</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Left his to the worthiest; so his successor</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Was like to be the best.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Good Paulina,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Who hast the memory of Hermione,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>I know, in honour, O, that ever I</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Have taken treasure from her lips&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>And left them</span><br/>
<span id='65'>More rich for what they yielded.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Thou speak'st truth.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And better used, would make her sainted spirit</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And begin, 'Why to me?'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Had she such power,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>She had just cause.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>She had; and would incense me</span><br/>
<span id='75'>To murder her I married.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>I should so.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't</span><br/>
<span id='79'>You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Should be 'Remember mine.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Stars, stars,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>I'll have no wife, Paulina.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Will you swear</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Never to marry but by my free leave?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CLEOMENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>You tempt him over-much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Unless another,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>As like Hermione as is her picture,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Affront his eye.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CLEOMENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>                  Good madam,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>I have done.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Yet, if my lord will marry,&mdash;if you will, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>No remedy, but you will,&mdash;give me the office</span><br/>
<span id='97'>To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young</span><br/>
<span id='98'>As was your former; but she shall be such</span><br/>
<span id='99'>As, walk'd your first queen's ghost, it should take joy</span><br/>
<span id='100'>To see her in your arms.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>My true Paulina,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>That</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Never till then.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Gentleman</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she</span><br/>
<span id='108'>The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access</span><br/>
<span id='109'>To your high presence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>What with him? he comes not</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Like to his father's greatness: his approach,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us</span><br/>
<span id='113'>'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced</span><br/>
<span id='114'>By need and accident. What train?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>But few,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And those but mean.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>His princess, say you, with him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>That e'er the sun shone bright on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>O Hermione,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>As every present time doth boast itself</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Above a better gone, so must thy grave</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Have said and writ so, but your writing now</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Nor was not to be equall'd;'&mdash;thus your verse</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>To say you have seen a better.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Pardon, madam:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>The one I have almost forgot,&mdash;your pardon,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Of all professors else, make proselytes</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Of who she but bid follow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>How! not women?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Women will love her, that she is a woman</span><br/>
<span id='138'>More worth than any man; men, that she is</span><br/>
<span id='139'>The rarest of all women.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Go, Cleomenes;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt CLEOMENES and others</em></p>
<span id='143'>He thus should steal upon us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Had our prince,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Well with this lord: there was not full a month</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Between their births.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st</span><br/>
<span id='149'>He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Will bring me to consider that which may</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA</em></p>
<span id='153'>Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;</span><br/>
<span id='154'>For she did print your royal father off,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Your father's image is so hit in you,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>His very air, that I should call you brother,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>As I did him, and speak of something wildly</span><br/>
<span id='159'>By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!</span><br/>
<span id='160'>And your fair princess,&mdash;goddess!&mdash;O, alas!</span><br/>
<span id='161'>I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Might thus have stood begetting wonder as</span><br/>
<span id='163'>You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='164'>All mine own folly&mdash;the society,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Amity too, of your brave father, whom,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Though bearing misery, I desire my life</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Once more to look on him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>FLORIZEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>By his command</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Can send his brother: and, but infirmity</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Which waits upon worn times hath something seized</span><br/>
<span id='173'>His wish'd ability, he had himself</span><br/>
<span id='174'>The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Measured to look upon you; whom he loves&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='176'>He bade me say so&mdash;more than all the sceptres</span><br/>
<span id='177'>And those that bear them living.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>O my brother,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Afresh within me, and these thy offices,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>So rarely kind, are as interpreters</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>To greet a man not worth her pains, much less</span><br/>
<span id='187'>The adventure of her person?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>FLORIZEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Good my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>She came from Libya.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>Where the warlike Smalus,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>FLORIZEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter</span><br/>
<span id='193'>His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>To execute the charge my father gave me</span><br/>
<span id='196'>For visiting your highness: my best train</span><br/>
<span id='197'>I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Who for Bohemia bend, to signify</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Not only my success in Libya, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>But my arrival and my wife's in safety</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Here where we are.</span><br/>

<span id='205'>A graceful gentleman; against whose person,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>So sacred as it is, I have done sin:</span><br/>
<span id='207'>For which the heavens, taking angry note,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>As he from heaven merits it, with you</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Such goodly things as you!</span><br/>

<span id='217'>Desires you to attach his son, who has&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='218'>His dignity and duty both cast off&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with</span><br/>

<span id='253'>That 'once' I see by your good father's speed</span><br/>

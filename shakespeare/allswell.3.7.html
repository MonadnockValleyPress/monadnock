<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene VII</h3>
<h4>Florence. The Widow's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter HELENA and Widow</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>If you misdoubt me that I am not she,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>I know not how I shall assure you further,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Nothing acquainted with these businesses;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And would not put my reputation now</span><br/>
<span id='7'>In any staining act.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Nor would I wish you.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Err in bestowing it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>I should believe you:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>For you have show'd me that which well approves</span><br/>
<span id='16'>You're great in fortune.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Take this purse of gold,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And let me buy your friendly help thus far,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Which I will over-pay and pay again</span><br/>
<span id='20'>When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Now his important blood will nought deny</span><br/>
<span id='25'>That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>That downward hath succeeded in his house</span><br/>
<span id='27'>From son to son, some four or five descents</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds</span><br/>
<span id='29'>In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Howe'er repented after.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Now I see</span><br/>
<span id='33'>The bottom of your purpose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>You see it lawful, then: it is no more,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>In fine, delivers me to fill the time,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Herself most chastely absent: after this,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns</span><br/>
<span id='40'>To what is passed already.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>I have yielded:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>That time and place with this deceit so lawful</span><br/>
<span id='44'>May prove coherent. Every night he comes</span><br/>
<span id='45'>With musics of all sorts and songs composed</span><br/>
<span id='46'>To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us</span><br/>
<span id='47'>To chide him from our eaves; for he persists</span><br/>
<span id='48'>As if his life lay on't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Why then to-night</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And lawful meaning in a lawful act,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>But let's about it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

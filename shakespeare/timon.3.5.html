<h1>Timon of Athens</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene V</h3>
<h4>The same. The senate-house. The Senate sitting.</h4>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>My lord, you have my voice to it; the fault's</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Bloody; 'tis necessary he should die:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Most true; the law shall bruise him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ALCIBIADES, with Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Now, captain?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>I am an humble suitor to your virtues;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>For pity is the virtue of the law,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And none but tyrants use it cruelly.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth</span><br/>
<span id='13'>To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>He is a man, setting his fate aside,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Of comely virtues:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>An honour in him which buys out his fault&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>But with a noble fury and fair spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>He did oppose his foe:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And with such sober and unnoted passion</span><br/>
<span id='22'>He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>As if he had but proved an argument.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>You undergo too strict a paradox,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd</span><br/>
<span id='27'>To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Upon the head of valour; which indeed</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Is valour misbegot and came into the world</span><br/>
<span id='30'>When sects and factions were newly born:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer</span><br/>
<span id='32'>The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs</span><br/>
<span id='33'>His outsides, to wear them like his raiment,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>carelessly,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>To bring it into danger.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>My lord,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>       You cannot make gross sins look clear:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>To revenge is no valour, but to bear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>If I speak like a captain.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And let the foes quietly cut their throats,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Without repugnancy? If there be</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Such valour in the bearing, what make we</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Abroad? why then, women are more valiant</span><br/>
<span id='50'>That stay at home, if bearing carry it,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>As you are great, be pitifully good:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?</span><br/>
<span id='56'>To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>To be in anger is impiety;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>But who is man that is not angry?</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Weigh but the crime with this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Second Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>You breathe in vain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>In vain! his service done</span><br/>
<span id='63'>At Lacedaemon and Byzantium</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Were a sufficient briber for his life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>What's that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>I say, my lords, he has done fair service,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And slain in fight many of your enemies:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>How full of valour did he bear himself</span><br/>
<span id='69'>In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Second Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>He has made too much plenty with 'em;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>If there were no foes, that were enough</span><br/>
<span id='74'>To overcome him: in that beastly fury</span><br/>
<span id='75'>He has been known to commit outrages,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>His days are foul and his drink dangerous.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>He dies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Hard fate! he might have died in war.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>My lords, if not for any parts in him&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Though his right arm might purchase his own time</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And be in debt to none&mdash;yet, more to move you,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And, for I know your reverend ages love</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Security, I'll pawn my victories, all</span><br/>
<span id='86'>My honours to you, upon his good returns.</span><br/>
<span id='87'>If by this crime he owes the law his life,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore</span><br/>
<span id='89'>For law is strict, and war is nothing more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>He forfeits his own blood that spills another.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>I do beseech you, know me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Second Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>How!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Call me to your remembrances.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Third Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>What!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>I cannot think but your age has forgot me;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>It could not else be, I should prove so base,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>To sue, and be denied such common grace:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>My wounds ache at you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Do you dare our anger?</span><br/>
<span id='103'>'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>We banish thee for ever.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Banish me!</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Banish your dotage; banish usury,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>That makes the senate ugly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell</span><br/>
<span id='110'>our spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>He shall be executed presently.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Senators</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ALCIBIADES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may live</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Only in bone, that none may look on you!</span><br/>
<span id='114'>I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>While they have told their money and let out</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Their coin upon large interest, I myself</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Is this the balsam that the usuring senate</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!</span><br/>
<span id='120'>It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up</span><br/>
<span id='123'>My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.</span><br/>
<span id='124'>'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

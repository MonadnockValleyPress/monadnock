<h1>Winter's Tale</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Bohemia. A desert country near the sea.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ANTIGONUS with a Child, and a Mariner</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The deserts of Bohemia?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Mariner</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Ay, my lord: and fear</span><br/>
<span id='4'>We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>The heavens with that we have in hand are angry</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And frown upon 's.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before</span><br/>
<span id='10'>I call upon thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Mariner</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Make your best haste, and go not</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Besides, this place is famous for the creatures</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Of prey that keep upon't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Go thou away:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>I'll follow instantly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Mariner</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>I am glad at heart</span><br/>
<span id='18'>To be so rid o' the business.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Come, poor babe:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>I have heard, but not believed, the spirits o' the dead</span><br/>
<span id='21'>May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream</span><br/>
<span id='23'>So like a waking. To me comes a creature,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Sometimes her head on one side, some another;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Like very sanctity, she did approach</span><br/>
<span id='28'>My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Did this break from her: 'Good Antigonus,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Since fate, against thy better disposition,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Hath made thy person for the thrower-out</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Places remote enough are in Bohemia,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks</span><br/>
<span id='41'>She melted into air. Affrighted much,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>I did in time collect myself and thought</span><br/>
<span id='43'>This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>I will be squared by this. I do believe</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Apollo would, this being indeed the issue</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Either for life or death, upon the earth</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!</span><br/>
<span id='51'>There lie, and there thy character: there these;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed</span><br/>
<span id='55'>To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I</span><br/>
<span id='57'>To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!</span><br/>
<span id='58'>The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have</span><br/>
<span id='59'>A lullaby too rough: I never saw</span><br/>
<span id='60'>The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>I am gone for ever.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit, pursued by a bear</em></p>
<p><em>Enter a Shepherd</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>I would there were no age between sixteen and</span><br/>
<span id='64'>three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the</span><br/>
<span id='65'>rest; for there is nothing in the between but</span><br/>
<span id='66'>getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>stealing, fighting&mdash;Hark you now! Would any but</span><br/>
<span id='68'>these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty</span><br/>
<span id='69'>hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my</span><br/>
<span id='70'>best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find</span><br/>
<span id='71'>than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by</span><br/>
<span id='72'>the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy</span><br/>
<span id='73'>will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very</span><br/>
<span id='74'>pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A</span><br/>
<span id='75'>pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>though I am not bookish, yet I can read</span><br/>
<span id='77'>waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been</span><br/>
<span id='78'>some stair-work, some trunk-work, some</span><br/>
<span id='79'>behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this</span><br/>
<span id='80'>than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for</span><br/>
<span id='81'>pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed</span><br/>
<span id='82'>but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Clown</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Hilloa, loa!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk</span><br/>
<span id='85'>on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What</span><br/>
<span id='86'>ailest thou, man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!</span><br/>
<span id='88'>but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the</span><br/>
<span id='89'>sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust</span><br/>
<span id='90'>a bodkin's point.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Why, boy, how is it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>how it takes up the shore! but that's not the</span><br/>
<span id='94'>point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!</span><br/>
<span id='95'>sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the</span><br/>
<span id='96'>ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon</span><br/>
<span id='97'>swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a</span><br/>
<span id='98'>cork into a hogshead. And then for the</span><br/>
<span id='99'>land-service, to see how the bear tore out his</span><br/>
<span id='100'>shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said</span><br/>
<span id='101'>his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an</span><br/>
<span id='102'>end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned</span><br/>
<span id='103'>it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the</span><br/>
<span id='104'>sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared</span><br/>
<span id='105'>and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than</span><br/>
<span id='106'>the sea or weather.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Name of mercy, when was this, boy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these</span><br/>
<span id='109'>sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor</span><br/>
<span id='110'>the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it</span><br/>
<span id='111'>now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>I would you had been by the ship side, to have</span><br/>
<span id='114'>helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things</span><br/>
<span id='117'>dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for</span><br/>
<span id='118'>thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's</span><br/>
<span id='119'>child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;</span><br/>
<span id='120'>open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be</span><br/>
<span id='121'>rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>open't. What's within, boy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth</span><br/>
<span id='124'>are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up</span><br/>
<span id='126'>with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.</span><br/>
<span id='127'>We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires</span><br/>
<span id='128'>nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good</span><br/>
<span id='129'>boy, the next way home.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see</span><br/>
<span id='131'>if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much</span><br/>
<span id='132'>he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they</span><br/>
<span id='133'>are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury</span><br/>
<span id='134'>it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that</span><br/>
<span id='136'>which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the</span><br/>
<span id='137'>sight of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

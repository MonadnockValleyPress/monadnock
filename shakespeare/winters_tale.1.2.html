<h1>Winter's Tale</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</h3>
<h4>A room of state in the same.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Nine changes of the watery star hath been</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The shepherd's note since we have left our throne</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Without a burthen: time as long again</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And yet we should, for perpetuity,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Yet standing in rich place, I multiply</span><br/>
<span id='8'>With one 'We thank you' many thousands more</span><br/>
<span id='9'>That go before it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>                  Stay your thanks a while;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And pay them when you part.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Sir, that's to-morrow.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Or breed upon our absence; that may blow</span><br/>
<span id='15'>No sneaping winds at home, to make us say</span><br/>
<span id='16'>'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd</span><br/>
<span id='17'>To tire your royalty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>We are tougher, brother,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Than you can put us to't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>No longer stay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>One seven-night longer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Very sooth, to-morrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>We'll part the time between's then; and in that</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I'll no gainsaying.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Press me not, beseech you, so.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Were there necessity in your request, although</span><br/>
<span id='29'>'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Were in your love a whip to me; my stay</span><br/>
<span id='32'>To you a charge and trouble: to save both,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Farewell, our brother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Tongue-tied, our queen?</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Speak you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until</span><br/>
<span id='37'>You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure</span><br/>
<span id='39'>All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction</span><br/>
<span id='40'>The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>He's beat from his best ward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Well said, Hermione.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>But let him say so then, and let him go;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia</span><br/>
<span id='49'>You take my lord, I'll give him my commission</span><br/>
<span id='50'>To let him there a month behind the gest</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind</span><br/>
<span id='53'>What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>No, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Nay, but you will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>                  I may not, verily.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Verily!</span><br/>
<span id='58'>You put me off with limber vows; but I,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Though you would seek to unsphere the</span><br/>
<span id='60'>stars with oaths,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's</span><br/>
<span id='63'>As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Force me to keep you as a prisoner,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees</span><br/>
<span id='66'>When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?</span><br/>
<span id='67'>My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'</span><br/>
<span id='68'>One of them you shall be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Your guest, then, madam:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>To be your prisoner should import offending;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Which is for me less easy to commit</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Than you to punish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Not your gaoler, then,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>You were pretty lordings then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>We were, fair queen,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Two lads that thought there was no more behind</span><br/>
<span id='79'>But such a day to-morrow as to-day,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And to be boy eternal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Was not my lord</span><br/>
<span id='82'>The verier wag o' the two?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And bleat the one at the other: what we changed</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Was innocence for innocence; we knew not</span><br/>
<span id='86'>The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd</span><br/>
<span id='87'>That any did. Had we pursued that life,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd</span><br/>
<span id='89'>With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Hereditary ours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>                  By this we gather</span><br/>
<span id='93'>You have tripp'd since.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>O my most sacred lady!</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Temptations have since then been born to's; for</span><br/>
<span id='96'>In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Of my young play-fellow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Grace to boot!</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Of this make no conclusion, lest you say</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>The offences we have made you do we'll answer,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>If you first sinn'd with us and that with us</span><br/>
<span id='104'>You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not</span><br/>
<span id='105'>With any but with us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Is he won yet?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>He'll stay my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>At my request he would not.</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest</span><br/>
<span id='110'>To better purpose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>                                 Never?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Never, but once.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>What! have I twice said well? when was't before?</span><br/>
<span id='114'>I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's</span><br/>
<span id='115'>As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Our praises are our wages: you may ride's</span><br/>
<span id='118'>With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere</span><br/>
<span id='119'>With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>My last good deed was to entreat his stay:</span><br/>
<span id='121'>What was my first? it has an elder sister,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!</span><br/>
<span id='123'>But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Nay, let me have't; I long.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Why, that was when</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Ere I could make thee open thy white hand</span><br/>
<span id='128'>And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter</span><br/>
<span id='129'>'I am yours for ever.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>'Tis grace indeed.</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:</span><br/>
<span id='132'>The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>The other for some while a friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>[Aside]	Too hot, too hot!</span><br/>
<span id='135'>To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.</span><br/>
<span id='136'>I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;</span><br/>
<span id='137'>But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment</span><br/>
<span id='138'>May a free face put on, derive a liberty</span><br/>
<span id='139'>From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>As now they are, and making practised smiles,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere</span><br/>
<span id='144'>The mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment</span><br/>
<span id='145'>My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Art thou my boy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MAMILLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>                           Ay, my good lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>I' fecks!</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast</span><br/>
<span id='150'>smutch'd thy nose?</span><br/>
<span id='151'>They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:</span><br/>
<span id='153'>And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Are all call'd neat.&mdash;Still virginalling</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Upon his palm!&mdash;How now, you wanton calf!</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Art thou my calf?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MAMILLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>                  Yes, if you will, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>To be full like me: yet they say we are</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Almost as like as eggs; women say so,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>That will say anything but were they false</span><br/>
<span id='162'>As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false</span><br/>
<span id='163'>As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes</span><br/>
<span id='164'>No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true</span><br/>
<span id='165'>To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?&mdash;may't be?&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Thou dost make possible things not so held,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Communicatest with dreams;&mdash;how can this be?&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='171'>With what's unreal thou coactive art,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>And that beyond commission, and I find it,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>And that to the infection of my brains</span><br/>
<span id='176'>And hardening of my brows.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>What means Sicilia?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>He something seems unsettled.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>How, my lord!</span><br/>
<span id='180'>What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>You look as if you held a brow of much distraction:</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Are you moved, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>No, in good earnest.</span><br/>
<span id='184'>How sometimes nature will betray its folly,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime</span><br/>
<span id='186'>To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:</span><br/>
<span id='192'>How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Will you take eggs for money?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MAMILLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>No, my lord, I'll fight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Are you so fond of your young prince as we</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Do seem to be of ours?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>If at home, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:</span><br/>
<span id='203'>He makes a July's day short as December,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>And with his varying childness cures in me</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Thoughts that would thick my blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>So stands this squire</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Next to thyself and my young rover, he's</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Apparent to my heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>

<span id='213'>If you would seek us,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?</span><br/>

<span id='216'>Be you beneath the sky.</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>

<span id='218'>Though you perceive me not how I give line.</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Go to, go to!</span><br/>
<span id='220'>How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!</span><br/>
<span id='221'>And arms her with the boldness of a wife</span><br/>
<span id='222'>To her allowing husband!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants</em></p>
<span id='223'>Gone already!</span><br/>
<span id='224'>Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and</span><br/>

<span id='226'>Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I</span><br/>
<span id='227'>Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour</span><br/>
<span id='229'>Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.</span><br/>
<span id='230'>There have been,</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;</span><br/>
<span id='232'>And many a man there is, even at this present,</span><br/>
<span id='233'>Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,</span><br/>
<span id='234'>That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence</span><br/>
<span id='235'>And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by</span><br/>
<span id='236'>Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't</span><br/>
<span id='237'>Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,</span><br/>
<span id='238'>As mine, against their will. Should all despair</span><br/>
<span id='239'>That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind</span><br/>
<span id='240'>Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;</span><br/>
<span id='241'>It is a bawdy planet, that will strike</span><br/>

<span id='244'>No barricado for a belly; know't;</span><br/>

<h3>Act I, Prologue</h3>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Chorus</em>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Chorus</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And young affection gapes to be his heir;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>But to his foe supposed he must complain,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Being held a foe, he may not have access</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And she as much in love, her means much less</span><br/>
<span id='12'>To meet her new-beloved any where:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>But passion lends them power, time means, to meet</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<em>Enter KING HENRY IV in his nightgown, with a Page</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>But, ere they come, bid them o'er-read these letters,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And well consider of them; make good speed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Page</em></p>
<span id='4'>How many thousand of my poorest subjects</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And steep my senses in forgetfulness?</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Under the canopies of costly state,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?</span><br/>
<span id='15'>O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile</span><br/>
<span id='16'>In loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couch</span><br/>
<span id='17'>A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains</span><br/>
<span id='20'>In cradle of the rude imperious surge</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And in the visitation of the winds,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Who take the ruffian billows by the top,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them</span><br/>
<span id='24'>With deafening clamour in the slippery clouds,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>That, with the hurly, death itself awakes?</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose</span><br/>
<span id='27'>To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And in the calmest and most stillest night,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>With all appliances and means to boot,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Deny it to a king? Then happy low, lie down!</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter WARWICK and SURREY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Many good morrows to your majesty!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Is it good morrow, lords?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>'Tis one o'clock, and past.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Why, then, good morrow to you all, my lords.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>We have, my liege.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Then you perceive the body of our kingdom</span><br/>
<span id='39'>How foul it is; what rank diseases grow</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And with what danger, near the heart of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>It is but as a body yet distemper'd;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Which to his former strength may be restored</span><br/>
<span id='43'>With good advice and little medicine:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>O God! that one might read the book of fate,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And see the revolution of the times</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Make mountains level, and the continent,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Weary of solid firmness, melt itself</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Into the sea! and, other times, to see</span><br/>
<span id='50'>The beachy girdle of the ocean</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Too wide for Neptune's hips; how chances mock,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And changes fill the cup of alteration</span><br/>
<span id='53'>With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>What perils past, what crosses to ensue,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>'Tis not 'ten years gone</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Did feast together, and in two years after</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Were they at wars: it is but eight years since</span><br/>
<span id='61'>This Percy was the man nearest my soul,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And laid his love and life under my foot,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Gave him defiance. But which of you was by&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>To WARWICK</em></p>
<span id='67'>When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Then cheque'd and rated by Northumberland,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Did speak these words, now proved a prophecy?</span><br/>
<span id='70'>'Northumberland, thou ladder by the which</span><br/>
<span id='71'>My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne;'</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>But that necessity so bow'd the state</span><br/>
<span id='74'>That I and greatness were compell'd to kiss:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>'The time shall come,' thus did he follow it,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>'The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Shall break into corruption:' so went on,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Foretelling this same time's condition</span><br/>
<span id='79'>And the division of our amity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>There is a history in all men's lives,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Figuring the nature of the times deceased;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>The which observed, a man may prophesy,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>With a near aim, of the main chance of things</span><br/>
<span id='84'>As yet not come to life, which in their seeds</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And weak beginnings lie intreasured.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Such things become the hatch and brood of time;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And by the necessary form of this</span><br/>
<span id='88'>King Richard might create a perfect guess</span><br/>
<span id='89'>That great Northumberland, then false to him,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Which should not find a ground to root upon,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Unless on you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>                  Are these things then necessities?</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Then let us meet them like necessities:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And that same word even now cries out on us:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>They say the bishop and Northumberland</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Are fifty thousand strong.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>It cannot be, my lord;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Rumour doth double, like the voice and echo,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>The numbers of the fear'd. Please it your grace</span><br/>
<span id='101'>To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>The powers that you already have sent forth</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Shall bring this prize in very easily.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>To comfort you the more, I have received</span><br/>
<span id='105'>A certain instance that Glendower is dead.</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And these unseason'd hours perforce must add</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Unto your sickness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>I will take your counsel:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And were these inward wars once out of hand,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

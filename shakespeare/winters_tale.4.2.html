<h1>Winter's Tale</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Bohemia. The palace of Polixenes.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to</span><br/>
<span id='3'>grant this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CAMILLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I have for the most part been aired abroad, I</span><br/>
<span id='6'>desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent</span><br/>
<span id='7'>king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling</span><br/>
<span id='8'>sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to</span><br/>
<span id='9'>think so, which is another spur to my departure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of</span><br/>
<span id='11'>thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of</span><br/>
<span id='12'>thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to</span><br/>
<span id='13'>have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having</span><br/>
<span id='14'>made me businesses which none without thee can</span><br/>
<span id='15'>sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute</span><br/>
<span id='16'>them thyself or take away with thee the very</span><br/>
<span id='17'>services thou hast done; which if I have not enough</span><br/>
<span id='18'>considered, as too much I cannot, to be more</span><br/>
<span id='19'>thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit</span><br/>
<span id='20'>therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal</span><br/>
<span id='21'>country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very</span><br/>
<span id='22'>naming punishes me with the remembrance of that</span><br/>
<span id='23'>penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen</span><br/>
<span id='25'>and children are even now to be afresh lamented.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my</span><br/>
<span id='27'>son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not</span><br/>
<span id='28'>being gracious, than they are in losing them when</span><br/>
<span id='29'>they have approved their virtues.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CAMILLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What</span><br/>
<span id='31'>his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I</span><br/>
<span id='32'>have missingly noted, he is of late much retired</span><br/>
<span id='33'>from court and is less frequent to his princely</span><br/>
<span id='34'>exercises than formerly he hath appeared.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some</span><br/>
<span id='36'>care; so far that I have eyes under my service which</span><br/>
<span id='37'>look upon his removedness; from whom I have this</span><br/>
<span id='38'>intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a</span><br/>
<span id='39'>most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from</span><br/>
<span id='40'>very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his</span><br/>
<span id='41'>neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CAMILLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a</span><br/>
<span id='43'>daughter of most rare note: the report of her is</span><br/>
<span id='44'>extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I</span><br/>
<span id='46'>fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou</span><br/>
<span id='47'>shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not</span><br/>
<span id='48'>appearing what we are, have some question with the</span><br/>
<span id='49'>shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not</span><br/>
<span id='50'>uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and</span><br/>
<span id='52'>lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CAMILLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>I willingly obey your command.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

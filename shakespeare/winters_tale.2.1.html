<h1>Winter's Tale</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>A room in Leontes' palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and Ladies</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>'Tis past enduring.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Come, my gracious lord,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Shall I be your playfellow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MAMILLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>No, I'll none of you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Why, my sweet lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MAMILLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if</span><br/>
<span id='8'>I were a baby still. I love you better.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Second Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>And why so, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MAMILLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Not for because</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Become some women best, so that there be not</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Too much hair there, but in a semicircle</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Or a half-moon made with a pen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Second Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Who taught you this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MAMILLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now</span><br/>
<span id='17'>What colour are your eyebrows?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>First Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Blue, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MAMILLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose</span><br/>
<span id='20'>That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>First Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Hark ye;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Present our services to a fine new prince</span><br/>
<span id='24'>One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>If we would have you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Second Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>She is spread of late</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now</span><br/>
<span id='29'>I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And tell 's a tale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MAMILLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Merry or sad shall't be?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>As merry as you will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MAMILLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>A sad tale's best for winter: I have one</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Of sprites and goblins.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Let's have that, good sir.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best</span><br/>
<span id='37'>To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MAMILLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>There was a man&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>                  Nay, come, sit down; then on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MAMILLIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Yond crickets shall not hear it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Come on, then,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And give't me in mine ear.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Even to their ships.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>How blest am I</span><br/>
<span id='49'>In my just censure, in my true opinion!</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed</span><br/>
<span id='51'>In being so blest! There may be in the cup</span><br/>
<span id='52'>A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Is not infected: but if one present</span><br/>
<span id='55'>The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known</span><br/>
<span id='56'>How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>With violent hefts. I have drunk,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>and seen the spider.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Camillo was his help in this, his pander:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>There is a plot against my life, my crown;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>He has discover'd my design, and I</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick</span><br/>
<span id='65'>For them to play at will. How came the posterns</span><br/>
<span id='66'>So easily open?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>                  By his great authority;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Which often hath no less prevail'd than so</span><br/>
<span id='69'>On your command.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>                          I know't too well.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Have too much blood in him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>What is this? sport?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Away with him! and let her sport herself</span><br/>
<span id='77'>With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Has made thee swell thus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>But I'ld say he had not,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Howe'er you lean to the nayward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>You, my lords,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Look on her, mark her well; be but about</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and</span><br/>
<span id='85'>The justice of your bearts will thereto add</span><br/>
<span id='86'>'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Praise her but for this her without-door form,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight</span><br/>
<span id='89'>The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands</span><br/>
<span id='90'>That calumny doth use&mdash;O, I am out&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>That mercy does, for calumny will sear</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>She's an adulteress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Should a villain say so,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>The most replenish'd villain in the world,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>He were as much more villain: you, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Do but mistake.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>                  You have mistook, my lady,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Should a like language use to all degrees</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And mannerly distinguishment leave out</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said</span><br/>
<span id='108'>She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:</span><br/>
<span id='109'>More, she's a traitor and Camillo is</span><br/>
<span id='110'>A federary with her, and one that knows</span><br/>
<span id='111'>What she should shame to know herself</span><br/>
<span id='112'>But with her most vile principal, that she's</span><br/>
<span id='113'>A bed-swerver, even as bad as those</span><br/>
<span id='114'>That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy</span><br/>
<span id='115'>To this their late escape.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>No, by my life.</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that</span><br/>
<span id='119'>You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>You scarce can right me throughly then, to say</span><br/>
<span id='121'>You did mistake.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>                  No; if I mistake</span><br/>
<span id='123'>In those foundations which I build upon,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>The centre is not big enough to bear</span><br/>
<span id='125'>A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!</span><br/>
<span id='126'>He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty</span><br/>
<span id='127'>But that he speaks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>There's some ill planet reigns:</span><br/>
<span id='129'>I must be patient till the heavens look</span><br/>
<span id='130'>With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>I am not prone to weeping, as our sex</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Commonly are; the want of which vain dew</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have</span><br/>
<span id='134'>That honourable grief lodged here which burns</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>With thoughts so qualified as your charities</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so</span><br/>
<span id='138'>The king's will be perform'd!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Shall I be heard?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>My women may be with me; for you see</span><br/>
<span id='142'>My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;</span><br/>
<span id='143'>There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Has deserved prison, then abound in tears</span><br/>
<span id='145'>As I come out: this action I now go on</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:</span><br/>
<span id='147'>I never wish'd to see you sorry; now</span><br/>
<span id='148'>I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Go, do our bidding; hence!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit HERMIONE, guarded; with Ladies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Beseech your highness, call the queen again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Yourself, your queen, your son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>For her, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless</span><br/>
<span id='157'>I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>In this which you accuse her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>If it prove</span><br/>
<span id='160'>She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where</span><br/>
<span id='161'>I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;</span><br/>
<span id='163'>For every inch of woman in the world,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, if she be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>         Hold your peaces.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Good my lord,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:</span><br/>
<span id='168'>You are abused and by some putter-on</span><br/>
<span id='169'>That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven</span><br/>
<span id='172'>The second and the third, nine, and some five;</span><br/>
<span id='173'>If this prove true, they'll pay for't: by mine honour,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;</span><br/>
<span id='176'>And I had rather glib myself than they</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Should not produce fair issue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>Cease; no more.</span><br/>
<span id='179'>You smell this business with a sense as cold</span><br/>
<span id='180'>As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't</span><br/>
<span id='181'>As you feel doing thus; and see withal</span><br/>
<span id='182'>The instruments that feel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>If it be so,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>We need no grave to bury honesty:</span><br/>
<span id='185'>There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Of the whole dungy earth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>What! lack I credit?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Upon this ground; and more it would content me</span><br/>
<span id='190'>To have her honour true than your suspicion,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Be blamed for't how you might.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Why, what need we</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Commune with you of this, but rather follow</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves</span><br/>
<span id='199'>We need no more of your advice: the matter,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Properly ours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>                  And I wish, my liege,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>You had only in your silent judgment tried it,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Without more overture.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>How could that be?</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Either thou art most ignorant by age,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Added to their familiarity,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation</span><br/>
<span id='211'>But only seeing, all other circumstances</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:</span><br/>
<span id='213'>Yet, for a greater confirmation,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>For in an act of this importance 'twere</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post</span><br/>
<span id='216'>To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,</span><br/>
<span id='217'>Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know</span><br/>
<span id='218'>Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle</span><br/>
<span id='219'>They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,</span><br/>
<span id='220'>Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>Well done, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='222'>Though I am satisfied and need no more</span><br/>
<span id='223'>Than what I know, yet shall the oracle</span><br/>
<span id='224'>Give rest to the minds of others, such as he</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Whose ignorant credulity will not</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good</span><br/>
<span id='227'>From our free person she should be confined,</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence</span><br/>
<span id='229'>Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;</span><br/>
<span id='230'>We are to speak in public; for this business</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Will raise us all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>ANTIGONUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='232'>[Aside]</span><br/>
<span id='233'>To laughter, as I take it,</span><br/>
<span id='234'>If the good truth were known.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Much Ado About Nothing</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene V</h3>
<h4>Another room in Leonato's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LEONATO, with DOGBERRY and VERGES</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>What would you with me, honest neighbour?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you</span><br/>
<span id='3'>that decerns you nearly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Marry, this it is, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>VERGES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Yes, in truth it is, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>What is it, my good friends?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the</span><br/>
<span id='9'>matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so</span><br/>
<span id='10'>blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>VERGES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living</span><br/>
<span id='13'>that is an old man and no honester than I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Neighbours, you are tedious.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the</span><br/>
<span id='17'>poor duke's officers; but truly, for mine own part,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in</span><br/>
<span id='19'>my heart to bestow it all of your worship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>All thy tediousness on me, ah?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Yea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; for</span><br/>
<span id='22'>I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any</span><br/>
<span id='23'>man in the city; and though I be but a poor man, I</span><br/>
<span id='24'>am glad to hear it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>VERGES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>And so am I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>I would fain know what you have to say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>VERGES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Marry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your</span><br/>
<span id='28'>worship's presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant</span><br/>
<span id='29'>knaves as any in Messina.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>A good old man, sir; he will be talking: as they</span><br/>
<span id='31'>say, when the age is in, the wit is out: God help</span><br/>
<span id='32'>us! it is a world to see. Well said, i' faith,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two men</span><br/>
<span id='34'>ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest</span><br/>
<span id='35'>soul, i' faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever</span><br/>
<span id='36'>broke bread; but God is to be worshipped; all men</span><br/>
<span id='37'>are not alike; alas, good neighbour!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Gifts that God gives.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>I must leave you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed</span><br/>
<span id='42'>comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would</span><br/>
<span id='43'>have them this morning examined before your worship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Take their examination yourself and bring it me: I</span><br/>
<span id='45'>am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>It shall be suffigance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to</span><br/>
<span id='49'>her husband.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>I'll wait upon them: I am ready.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt LEONATO and Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we</span><br/>
<span id='53'>are now to examination these men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>VERGES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>And we must do it wisely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here's</span><br/>
<span id='56'>that shall drive some of them to a non-come: only</span><br/>
<span id='57'>get the learned writer to set down our</span><br/>
<span id='58'>excommunication and meet me at the gaol.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

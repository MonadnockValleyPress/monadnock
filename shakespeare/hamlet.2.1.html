<h4>Scene I. A room in POLONIUS' house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>REYNALDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>I will, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Before you visit him, to make inquire</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Of his behavior.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>REYNALDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>                  My lord, I did intend it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>What company, at what expense; and finding</span><br/>
<span id='11'>By this encompassment and drift of question</span><br/>
<span id='12'>That they do know my son, come you more nearer</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Than your particular demands will touch it:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>REYNALDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Ay, very well, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Addicted so and so:' and there put on him</span><br/>
<span id='21'>What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank</span><br/>
<span id='22'>As may dishonour him; take heed of that;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips</span><br/>
<span id='24'>As are companions noted and most known</span><br/>
<span id='25'>To youth and liberty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>REYNALDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>As gaming, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Drabbing: you may go so far.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>REYNALDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>My lord, that would dishonour him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge</span><br/>
<span id='31'>You must not put another scandal on him,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>That he is open to incontinency;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly</span><br/>
<span id='34'>That they may seem the taints of liberty,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>A savageness in unreclaimed blood,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Of general assault.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>REYNALDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>But, my good lord,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Wherefore should you do this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>REYNALDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Ay, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>I would know that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>                  Marry, sir, here's my drift;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>You laying these slight sullies on my son,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Your party in converse, him you would sound,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured</span><br/>
<span id='49'>He closes with you in this consequence;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'</span><br/>
<span id='51'>According to the phrase or the addition</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Of man and country.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>REYNALDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Very good, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>And then, sir, does he this&mdash;he does&mdash;what was I</span><br/>
<span id='55'>about to say? By the mass, I was about to say</span><br/>
<span id='56'>something: where did I leave?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>REYNALDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'</span><br/>
<span id='58'>and 'gentleman.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>See you now;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>With windlasses and with assays of bias,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>By indirections find directions out:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>So by my former lecture and advice,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>REYNALDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>My lord, I have.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>                  God be wi' you; fare you well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>REYNALDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Good my lord!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Observe his inclination in yourself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>REYNALDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>I shall, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>And let him ply his music.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>REYNALDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Well, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Farewell!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit REYNALDO</em></p>
<p><em>Enter OPHELIA</em></p>
<span id='82'>How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>With what, i' the name of God?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And with a look so piteous in purport</span><br/>
<span id='91'>As if he had been loosed out of hell</span><br/>
<span id='92'>To speak of horrors,&mdash;he comes before me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Mad for thy love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>                  My lord, I do not know;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>But truly, I do fear it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>What said he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>He took me by the wrist and held me hard;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Then goes he to the length of all his arm;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>He falls to such perusal of my face</span><br/>
<span id='101'>As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>At last, a little shaking of mine arm</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And thrice his head thus waving up and down,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>He raised a sigh so piteous and profound</span><br/>
<span id='105'>As it did seem to shatter all his bulk</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And end his being: that done, he lets me go:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>For out o' doors he went without their helps,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And, to the last, bended their light on me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>This is the very ecstasy of love,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Whose violent property fordoes itself</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And leads the will to desperate undertakings</span><br/>
<span id='115'>As oft as any passion under heaven</span><br/>
<span id='116'>That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.</span><br/>
<span id='117'>What, have you given him any hard words of late?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>No, my good lord, but, as you did command,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>I did repel his fetters and denied</span><br/>
<span id='120'>His access to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>                  That hath made him mad.</span><br/>
<span id='122'>I am sorry that with better heed and judgment</span><br/>
<span id='123'>I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!</span><br/>
<span id='125'>By heaven, it is as proper to our age</span><br/>
<span id='126'>To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions</span><br/>
<span id='127'>As it is common for the younger sort</span><br/>
<span id='128'>To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:</span><br/>
<span id='129'>This must be known; which, being kept close, might</span><br/>
<span id='130'>move</span><br/>
<span id='131'>More grief to hide than hate to utter love.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

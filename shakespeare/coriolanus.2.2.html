<h1>Coriolanus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The same. The Capitol.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter two Officers, to lay cushions</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand</span><br/>
<span id='2'>for consulships?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Coriolanus will carry it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>First Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and</span><br/>
<span id='6'>loves not the common people.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Faith, there had been many great men that have</span><br/>
<span id='8'>flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there</span><br/>
<span id='9'>be many that they have loved, they know not</span><br/>
<span id='10'>wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate</span><br/>
<span id='13'>him manifests the true knowledge he has in their</span><br/>
<span id='14'>disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets</span><br/>
<span id='15'>them plainly see't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>If he did not care whether he had their love or no,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither</span><br/>
<span id='18'>good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater</span><br/>
<span id='19'>devotion than can render it him; and leaves</span><br/>
<span id='20'>nothing undone that may fully discover him their</span><br/>
<span id='21'>opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and</span><br/>
<span id='22'>displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he</span><br/>
<span id='23'>dislikes, to flatter them for their love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Second Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his</span><br/>
<span id='25'>ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>having been supple and courteous to the people,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>bonneted, without any further deed to have them at</span><br/>
<span id='28'>an into their estimation and report: but he hath so</span><br/>
<span id='29'>planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions</span><br/>
<span id='30'>in their hearts, that for their tongues to be</span><br/>
<span id='31'>silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of</span><br/>
<span id='32'>ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a</span><br/>
<span id='33'>malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck</span><br/>
<span id='34'>reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>First Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they</span><br/>
<span id='36'>are coming.</span><br/>
<p><em>A sennet. Enter, with actors before them, COMINIUS  the consul, MENENIUS, CORIOLANUS, Senators,  SICINIUS and BRUTUS. The Senators take their  places; the Tribunes take their Places by themselves. CORIOLANUS stands</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Having determined of the Volsces and</span><br/>
<span id='38'>To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>As the main point of this our after-meeting,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>To gratify his noble service that</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>please you,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Most reverend and grave elders, to desire</span><br/>
<span id='44'>The present consul, and last general</span><br/>
<span id='45'>In our well-found successes, to report</span><br/>
<span id='46'>A little of that worthy work perform'd</span><br/>
<span id='47'>By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom</span><br/>
<span id='48'>We met here both to thank and to remember</span><br/>
<span id='49'>With honours like himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Speak, good Cominius:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Leave nothing out for length, and make us think</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Rather our state's defective for requital</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Than we to stretch it out.</span><br/>
<p><em>To the Tribunes</em></p>
<span id='54'>Masters o' the people,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>We do request your kindest ears, and after,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Your loving motion toward the common body,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>To yield what passes here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>We are convented</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Inclinable to honour and advance</span><br/>
<span id='61'>The theme of our assembly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Which the rather</span><br/>
<span id='63'>We shall be blest to do, if he remember</span><br/>
<span id='64'>A kinder value of the people than</span><br/>
<span id='65'>He hath hereto prized them at.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>That's off, that's off;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>I would you rather had been silent. Please you</span><br/>
<span id='68'>To hear Cominius speak?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Most willingly;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>But yet my caution was more pertinent</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Than the rebuke you give it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>He loves your people</span><br/>
<span id='73'>But tie him not to be their bedfellow.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Worthy Cominius, speak.</span><br/>
<p><em>CORIOLANUS offers to go away</em></p>
<span id='75'>Nay, keep your place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear</span><br/>
<span id='77'>What you have nobly done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Your horror's pardon:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>I had rather have my wounds to heal again</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Than hear say how I got them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Sir, I hope</span><br/>
<span id='82'>My words disbench'd you not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>No, sir: yet oft,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but</span><br/>
<span id='86'>your people,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>I love them as they weigh.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Pray now, sit down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun</span><br/>
<span id='90'>When the alarum were struck than idly sit</span><br/>
<span id='91'>To hear my nothings monster'd.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Masters of the people,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>That's thousand to one good one&mdash;when you now see</span><br/>
<span id='95'>He had rather venture all his limbs for honour</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held</span><br/>
<span id='99'>That valour is the chiefest virtue, and</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Most dignifies the haver: if it be,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>The man I speak of cannot in the world</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>When with his Amazonian chin he drove</span><br/>
<span id='107'>The bristled lips before him: be bestrid</span><br/>
<span id='108'>An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>When he might act the woman in the scene,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And in the brunt of seventeen battles since</span><br/>
<span id='116'>He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Before and in Corioli, let me say,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And by his rare example made the coward</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Turn terror into sport: as weeds before</span><br/>
<span id='121'>A vessel under sail, so men obey'd</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot</span><br/>
<span id='124'>He was a thing of blood, whose every motion</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd</span><br/>
<span id='126'>The mortal gate of the city, which he painted</span><br/>
<span id='127'>With shunless destiny; aidless came off,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>And with a sudden reinforcement struck</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Corioli like a planet: now all's his:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce</span><br/>
<span id='131'>His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And to the battle came he; where he did</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if</span><br/>
<span id='135'>'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Both field and city ours, he never stood</span><br/>
<span id='137'>To ease his breast with panting.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Worthy man!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>He cannot but with measure fit the honours</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Which we devise him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Our spoils he kick'd at,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>And look'd upon things precious as they were</span><br/>
<span id='143'>The common muck of the world: he covets less</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Than misery itself would give; rewards</span><br/>
<span id='145'>His deeds with doing them, and is content</span><br/>
<span id='146'>To spend the time to end it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>He's right noble:</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Let him be call'd for.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Call Coriolanus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Officer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>He doth appear.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter CORIOLANUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased</span><br/>
<span id='152'>To make thee consul.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>I do owe them still</span><br/>
<span id='154'>My life and services.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>It then remains</span><br/>
<span id='156'>That you do speak to the people.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>I do beseech you,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you</span><br/>
<span id='161'>That I may pass this doing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Sir, the people</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Must have their voices; neither will they bate</span><br/>
<span id='164'>One jot of ceremony.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Put them not to't:</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Pray you, go fit you to the custom and</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Take to you, as your predecessors have,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Your honour with your form.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>It is apart</span><br/>
<span id='170'>That I shall blush in acting, and might well</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Be taken from the people.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Mark you that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>As if I had received them for the hire</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Of their breath only!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>Do not stand upon't.</span><br/>
<span id='178'>We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Wish we all joy and honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>Senators</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>You see how he intends to use the people.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>May they perceive's intent! He will require them,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>As if he did contemn what he requested</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Should be in them to give.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>Come, we'll inform them</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>I know, they do attend us.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

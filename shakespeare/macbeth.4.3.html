<h1>Macbeth</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene III</h3>
<h4>England. Before the King's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Weep our sad bosoms empty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Let us rather</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn</span><br/>
<span id='6'>New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds</span><br/>
<span id='8'>As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Like syllable of dolour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>What I believe I'll wail,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>What know believe, and what I can redress,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>As I shall find the time to friend, I will.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>but something</span><br/>
<span id='18'>You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom</span><br/>
<span id='19'>To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To appease an angry god.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>I am not treacherous.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>But Macbeth is.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>A good and virtuous nature may recoil</span><br/>
<span id='24'>In an imperial charge. But I shall crave</span><br/>
<span id='25'>your pardon;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Yet grace must still look so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>I have lost my hopes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Why in that rawness left you wife and child,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Without leave-taking? I pray you,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Whatever I shall think.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Bleed, bleed, poor country!</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou</span><br/>
<span id='41'>thy wrongs;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>I would not be the villain that thou think'st</span><br/>
<span id='44'>For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And the rich East to boot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Be not offended:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I speak not as in absolute fear of you.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Is added to her wounds: I think withal</span><br/>
<span id='51'>There would be hands uplifted in my right;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And here from gracious England have I offer</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Shall have more vices than it had before,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>By him that shall succeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>What should he be?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>It is myself I mean: in whom I know</span><br/>
<span id='61'>All the particulars of vice so grafted</span><br/>
<span id='62'>That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Esteem him as a lamb, being compared</span><br/>
<span id='65'>With my confineless harms.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Not in the legions</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd</span><br/>
<span id='68'>In evils to top Macbeth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>I grant him bloody,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin</span><br/>
<span id='72'>That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up</span><br/>
<span id='75'>The cistern of my lust, and my desire</span><br/>
<span id='76'>All continent impediments would o'erbear</span><br/>
<span id='77'>That did oppose my will: better Macbeth</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Than such an one to reign.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Boundless intemperance</span><br/>
<span id='80'>In nature is a tyranny; it hath been</span><br/>
<span id='81'>The untimely emptying of the happy throne</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And fall of many kings. But fear not yet</span><br/>
<span id='83'>To take upon you what is yours: you may</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>We have willing dames enough: there cannot be</span><br/>
<span id='87'>That vulture in you, to devour so many</span><br/>
<span id='88'>As will to greatness dedicate themselves,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Finding it so inclined.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>With this there grows</span><br/>
<span id='91'>In my most ill-composed affection such</span><br/>
<span id='92'>A stanchless avarice that, were I king,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>I should cut off the nobles for their lands,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Desire his jewels and this other's house:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And my more-having would be as a sauce</span><br/>
<span id='96'>To make me hunger more; that I should forge</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Destroying them for wealth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>This avarice</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been</span><br/>
<span id='102'>The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Of your mere own: all these are portable,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>With other graces weigh'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>But I have none: the king-becoming graces,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>I have no relish of them, but abound</span><br/>
<span id='111'>In the division of each several crime,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Uproar the universal peace, confound</span><br/>
<span id='115'>All unity on earth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>O Scotland, Scotland!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>If such a one be fit to govern, speak:</span><br/>
<span id='118'>I am as I have spoken.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Fit to govern!</span><br/>
<span id='120'>No, not to live. O nation miserable,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Since that the truest issue of thy throne</span><br/>
<span id='124'>By his own interdiction stands accursed,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!</span><br/>
<span id='129'>These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Thy hope ends here!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Macduff, this noble passion,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Child of integrity, hath from my soul</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='135'>To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth</span><br/>
<span id='136'>By many of these trains hath sought to win me</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me</span><br/>
<span id='138'>From over-credulous haste: but God above</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Deal between thee and me! for even now</span><br/>
<span id='140'>I put myself to thy direction, and</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure</span><br/>
<span id='142'>The taints and blames I laid upon myself,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>For strangers to my nature. I am yet</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>At no time broke my faith, would not betray</span><br/>
<span id='147'>The devil to his fellow and delight</span><br/>
<span id='148'>No less in truth than life: my first false speaking</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Was this upon myself: what I am truly,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Is thine and my poor country's to command:</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Already at a point, was setting forth.</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Such welcome and unwelcome things at once</span><br/>
<span id='157'>'Tis hard to reconcile.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Doctor</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>Well; more anon.&mdash;Comes the king forth, I pray you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls</span><br/>
<span id='160'>That stay his cure: their malady convinces</span><br/>
<span id='161'>The great assay of art; but at his touch&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='163'>They presently amend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>I thank you, doctor.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Doctor</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>What's the disease he means?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>'Tis call'd the evil:</span><br/>
<span id='167'>A most miraculous work in this good king;</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Which often, since my here-remain in England,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>The mere despair of surgery, he cures,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>To the succeeding royalty he leaves</span><br/>
<span id='176'>The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>And sundry blessings hang about his throne,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>That speak him full of grace.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ROSS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>See, who comes here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>My countryman; but yet I know him not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>I know him now. Good God, betimes remove</span><br/>
<span id='184'>The means that makes us strangers!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>Sir, amen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>Stands Scotland where it did?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Alas, poor country!</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems</span><br/>
<span id='193'>A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Expire before the flowers in their caps,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Dying or ere they sicken.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>O, relation</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Too nice, and yet too true!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>What's the newest grief?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Each minute teems a new one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>How does my wife?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>Why, well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>         And all my children?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>Well too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='207'>No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='209'>When I came hither to transport the tidings,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Of many worthy fellows that were out;</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Would create soldiers, make our women fight,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>To doff their dire distresses.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>Be't their comfort</span><br/>
<span id='218'>We are coming thither: gracious England hath</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;</span><br/>
<span id='220'>An older and a better soldier none</span><br/>
<span id='221'>That Christendom gives out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='222'>Would I could answer</span><br/>
<span id='223'>This comfort with the like! But I have words</span><br/>
<span id='224'>That would be howl'd out in the desert air,</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Where hearing should not latch them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='226'>What concern they?</span><br/>
<span id='227'>The general cause? or is it a fee-grief</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Due to some single breast?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='229'>No mind that's honest</span><br/>
<span id='230'>But in it shares some woe; though the main part</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Pertains to you alone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='232'>If it be mine,</span><br/>
<span id='233'>Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='234'>Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound</span><br/>
<span id='236'>That ever yet they heard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='237'>Hum! I guess at it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='238'>Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes</span><br/>
<span id='239'>Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,</span><br/>
<span id='240'>Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,</span><br/>
<span id='241'>To add the death of you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='242'>Merciful heaven!</span><br/>
<span id='243'>What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;</span><br/>
<span id='244'>Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak</span><br/>
<span id='245'>Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='246'>My children too?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>

<span id='247'>                  Wife, children, servants, all</span><br/>
<span id='248'>That could be found.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='249'>And I must be from thence!</span><br/>
<span id='250'>My wife kill'd too?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='251'>I have said.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='252'>Be comforted:</span><br/>
<span id='253'>Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,</span><br/>
<span id='254'>To cure this deadly grief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='255'>He has no children. All my pretty ones?</span><br/>
<span id='256'>Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?</span><br/>
<span id='257'>What, all my pretty chickens and their dam</span><br/>
<span id='258'>At one fell swoop?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='259'>Dispute it like a man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='260'>I shall do so;</span><br/>
<span id='261'>But I must also feel it as a man:</span><br/>
<span id='262'>I cannot but remember such things were,</span><br/>
<span id='263'>That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,</span><br/>
<span id='264'>And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,</span><br/>
<span id='265'>They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,</span><br/>
<span id='266'>Not for their own demerits, but for mine,</span><br/>
<span id='267'>Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='268'>Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief</span><br/>
<span id='269'>Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='270'>O, I could play the woman with mine eyes</span><br/>
<span id='271'>And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,</span><br/>
<span id='272'>Cut short all intermission; front to front</span><br/>
<span id='273'>Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;</span><br/>
<span id='274'>Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,</span><br/>
<span id='275'>Heaven forgive him too!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>

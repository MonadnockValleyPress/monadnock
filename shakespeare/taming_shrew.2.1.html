<h1>Taming of the Shrew</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Padua. A room in Baptista's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KATHARINA and BIANCA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>That I disdain: but for these other gawds,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Or what you will command me will I do,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>So well I know my duty to my elders.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Believe me, sister, of all the men alive</span><br/>
<span id='11'>I never yet beheld that special face</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Which I could fancy more than any other.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>If you affect him, sister, here I swear</span><br/>
<span id='15'>I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have</span><br/>
<span id='16'>him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>O then, belike, you fancy riches more:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>You will have Gremio to keep you fair.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Is it for him you do envy me so?</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive</span><br/>
<span id='21'>You have but jested with me all this while:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>If that be jest, then all the rest was so.</span><br/>
<p><em>Strikes her</em></p>
<p><em>Enter BAPTISTA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?</span><br/>
<span id='29'>When did she cross thee with a bitter word?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flies after BIANCA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit BIANCA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see</span><br/>
<span id='33'>She is your treasure, she must have a husband;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And for your love to her lead apes in hell.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Till I can find occasion of revenge.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?</span><br/>
<span id='39'>But who comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GREMIO, LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man;  PETRUCHIO, with HORTENSIO as a musician; and TRANIO, with BIONDELLO bearing a lute and books</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.</span><br/>
<span id='42'>God save you, gentlemen!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>You are too blunt: go to it orderly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Her affability and bashful modesty,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Am bold to show myself a forward guest</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Within your house, to make mine eye the witness</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Of that report which I so oft have heard.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And, for an entrance to my entertainment,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>I do present you with a man of mine,</span><br/>
<p><em>Presenting HORTENSIO</em></p>
<span id='57'>Cunning in music and the mathematics,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>To instruct her fully in those sciences,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Whereof I know she is not ignorant:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>His name is Licio, born in Mantua.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>She is not for your turn, the more my grief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>I see you do not mean to part with her,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Or else you like not of my company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>A man well known throughout all Italy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Baccare! you are marvellous forward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your</span><br/>
<span id='77'>wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am</span><br/>
<span id='78'>sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>that have been more kindly beholding to you than</span><br/>
<span id='80'>any, freely give unto you this young scholar,</span><br/>
<p><em>Presenting LUCENTIO</em></p>
<span id='81'>that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning</span><br/>
<span id='82'>in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other</span><br/>
<span id='83'>in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>accept his service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Welcome, good Cambio.</span><br/>
<p><em>To TRANIO</em></p>
<span id='87'>But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:</span><br/>
<span id='88'>may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>That, being a stranger in this city here,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>In the preferment of the eldest sister.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>This liberty is all that I request,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>That, upon knowledge of my parentage,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And free access and favour as the rest:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And, toward the education of your daughters,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>I here bestow a simple instrument,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>If you accept them, then their worth is great.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>A mighty man of Pisa; by report</span><br/>
<span id='106'>I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Take you the lute, and you the set of books;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>You shall go see your pupils presently.</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Holla, within!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Servant</em></p>
<span id='110'>Sirrah, lead these gentlemen</span><br/>
<span id='111'>To my daughters; and tell them both,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>These are their tutors: bid them use them well.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Servant, with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO, BIONDELLO following</em></p>
<span id='113'>We will go walk a little in the orchard,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And so I pray you all to think yourselves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And every day I cannot come to woo.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>You knew my father well, and in him me,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Which I have better'd rather than decreased:</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>What dowry shall I have with her to wife?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>After my death the one half of my lands,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And in possession twenty thousand crowns.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>In all my lands and leases whatsoever:</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>That covenants may be kept on either hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>That is, her love; for that is all in all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And where two raging fires meet together</span><br/>
<span id='135'>They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Though little fire grows great with little wind,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>So I to her and so she yields to me;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>For I am rough and woo not like a babe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!</span><br/>
<span id='141'>But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>That shake not, though they blow perpetually.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>What, will my daughter prove a good musician?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>I think she'll sooner prove a soldier</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.</span><br/>
<span id='151'>I did but tell her she mistook her frets,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;</span><br/>
<span id='153'>When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume</span><br/>
<span id='155'>with them:'</span><br/>
<span id='156'>And, with that word, she struck me on the head,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>And through the instrument my pate made way;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>And there I stood amazed for a while,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>As on a pillory, looking through the lute;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>While she did call me rascal fiddler</span><br/>
<span id='161'>And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>As had she studied to misuse me so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;</span><br/>
<span id='164'>I love her ten times more than e'er I did:</span><br/>
<span id='165'>O, how I long to have some chat with her!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;</span><br/>
<span id='168'>She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>I pray you do.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO</em></p>
<span id='172'>I will attend her here,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>And woo her with some spirit when she comes.</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain</span><br/>
<span id='175'>She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear</span><br/>
<span id='177'>As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Say she be mute and will not speak a word;</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Then I'll commend her volubility,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:</span><br/>
<span id='181'>If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>As though she bid me stay by her a week:</span><br/>
<span id='183'>If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day</span><br/>
<span id='184'>When I shall ask the banns and when be married.</span><br/>
<span id='185'>But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter KATHARINA</em></p>
<span id='186'>Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:</span><br/>
<span id='188'>They call me Katharina that do talk of me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;</span><br/>
<span id='191'>But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Remove you hence: I knew you at the first</span><br/>
<span id='201'>You were a moveable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>Why, what's a moveable?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>A join'd-stool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>Asses are made to bear, and so are you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>Women are made to bear, and so are you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='207'>No such jade as you, if me you mean.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;</span><br/>
<span id='209'>For, knowing thee to be but young and light&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>Too light for such a swain as you to catch;</span><br/>
<span id='211'>And yet as heavy as my weight should be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='212'>Should be! should&mdash;buzz!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='213'>Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='215'>Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>If I be waspish, best beware my sting.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>My remedy is then, to pluck it out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='219'>Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='220'>Who knows not where a wasp does</span><br/>
<span id='221'>wear his sting? In his tail.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='222'>In his tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='223'>Whose tongue?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='224'>Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='225'>What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Good Kate; I am a gentleman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='227'>That I'll try.</span><br/>
<p><em>She strikes him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='228'>I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='229'>So may you lose your arms:</span><br/>
<span id='230'>If you strike me, you are no gentleman;</span><br/>
<span id='231'>And if no gentleman, why then no arms.</span><br/>

<span id='232'>A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='233'>What is your crest? a coxcomb?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='234'>A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='235'>No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.</span><br/>

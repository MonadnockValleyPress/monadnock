<h1>Troilus and Cressida</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Troy. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter, from one side, AENEAS, and Servant with a  torch; from the other, PARIS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, DIOMEDES, and others, with torches</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>See, ho! who is that there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DEIPHOBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>It is the Lord AEneas.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>AENEAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Is the prince there in person?</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Had I so good occasion to lie long</span><br/>
<span id='5'>As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Should rob my bed-mate of my company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DIOMEDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>A valiant Greek, AEneas,&mdash;take his hand,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Witness the process of your speech, wherein</span><br/>
<span id='10'>You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Did haunt you in the field.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>AENEAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Health to you, valiant sir,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>During all question of the gentle truce;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance</span><br/>
<span id='15'>As heart can think or courage execute.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DIOMEDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>The one and other Diomed embraces.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!</span><br/>
<span id='18'>But when contention and occasion meet,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life</span><br/>
<span id='20'>With all my force, pursuit and policy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>AENEAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly</span><br/>
<span id='22'>With his face backward. In humane gentleness,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>No man alive can love in such a sort</span><br/>
<span id='26'>The thing he means to kill more excellently.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DIOMEDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>If to my sword his fate be not the glory,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>A thousand complete courses of the sun!</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>AENEAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>We know each other well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DIOMEDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>We do; and long to know each other worse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>What business, lord, so early?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>AENEAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To Calchas' house, and there to render him,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Let's have your company, or, if you please,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Haste there before us: I constantly do think&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Rouse him and give him note of our approach.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>With the whole quality wherefore: I fear</span><br/>
<span id='47'>We shall be much unwelcome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>AENEAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>That I assure you:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Than Cressid borne from Troy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>There is no help;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The bitter disposition of the time</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Will have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>AENEAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Good morrow, all.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit with Servant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Myself or Menelaus?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DIOMEDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Both alike:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Not making any scruple of her soilure,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>With such a hell of pain and world of charge,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And you as well to keep her, that defend her,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Not palating the taste of her dishonour,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up</span><br/>
<span id='67'>The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>But he as he, the heavier for a whore.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>You are too bitter to your countrywoman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DIOMEDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>For every false drop in her bawdy veins</span><br/>
<span id='75'>A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Of her contaminated carrion weight,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>She hath not given so many good words breath</span><br/>
<span id='79'>As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PARIS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>But we in silence hold this virtue well,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>We'll but commend what we intend to sell.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Here lies our way.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

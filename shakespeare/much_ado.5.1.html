<h1>Much Ado About Nothing</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Before Leonato's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>If you go on thus, you will kill yourself:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Against yourself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>                  I pray thee, cease thy counsel,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Which falls into mine ears as profitless</span><br/>
<span id='6'>As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Nor let no comforter delight mine ear</span><br/>
<span id='8'>But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Bring me a father that so loved his child,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And bid him speak of patience;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And let it answer every strain for strain,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>As thus for thus and such a grief for such,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk</span><br/>
<span id='19'>With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And I of him will gather patience.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>But there is no such man: for, brother, men</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Their counsel turns to passion, which before</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Would give preceptial medicine to rage,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Charm ache with air and agony with words:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience</span><br/>
<span id='29'>To those that wring under the load of sorrow,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But no man's virtue nor sufficiency</span><br/>
<span id='31'>To be so moral when he shall endure</span><br/>
<span id='32'>The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>My griefs cry louder than advertisement.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Therein do men from children nothing differ.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>For there was never yet philosopher</span><br/>
<span id='37'>That could endure the toothache patiently,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>However they have writ the style of gods</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And made a push at chance and sufferance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Make those that do offend you suffer too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And all of them that thus dishonour her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Good den, good den.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Good day to both of you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Hear you. my lords,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>We have some haste, Leonato.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>If he could right himself with quarreling,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Some of us would lie low.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Who wrongs him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou:&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>I fear thee not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>                  Marry, beshrew my hand,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>If it should give your age such cause of fear:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Tush, tush, man; never fleer and jest at me:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>As under privilege of age to brag</span><br/>
<span id='66'>What I have done being young, or what would do</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me</span><br/>
<span id='69'>That I am forced to lay my reverence by</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Do challenge thee to trial of a man.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And she lies buried with her ancestors;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>My villany?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>          Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>You say not right, old man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>My lord, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Despite his nice fence and his active practise,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Away! I will not have to do with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:</span><br/>
<span id='88'>But that's no matter; let him kill one first;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Win me and wear me; let him answer me.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me:</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Brother,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>That dare as well answer a man indeed</span><br/>
<span id='97'>As I dare take a serpent by the tongue:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Brother Antony,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Go anticly, show outward hideousness,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And this is all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>But, brother Antony,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Come, 'tis no matter:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:</span><br/>
<span id='113'>But, on my honour, she was charged with nothing</span><br/>
<span id='114'>But what was true and very full of proof.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>My lord, my lord,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I will not hear you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>And shall, or some of us will smart for it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt LEONATO and ANTONIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BENEDICK</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Now, signior, what news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Good day, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part</span><br/>
<span id='123'>almost a fray.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>We had like to have had our two noses snapped off</span><br/>
<span id='125'>with two old men without teeth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had</span><br/>
<span id='127'>we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came</span><br/>
<span id='129'>to seek you both.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are</span><br/>
<span id='131'>high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten</span><br/>
<span id='132'>away. Wilt thou use thy wit?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Never any did so, though very many have been beside</span><br/>
<span id='136'>their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the</span><br/>
<span id='137'>minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou</span><br/>
<span id='139'>sick, or angry?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you</span><br/>
<span id='143'>charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Nay, then, give him another staff: this last was</span><br/>
<span id='145'>broke cross.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>By this light, he changes more and more: I think</span><br/>
<span id='147'>he be angry indeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Shall I speak a word in your ear?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>God bless me from a challenge!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>[Aside to CLAUDIO]  You are a villain; I jest not:</span><br/>
<span id='152'>I will make it good how you dare, with what you</span><br/>
<span id='153'>dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will</span><br/>
<span id='154'>protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet</span><br/>
<span id='155'>lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me</span><br/>
<span id='156'>hear from you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>What, a feast, a feast?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>I' faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf's</span><br/>
<span id='160'>head and a capon; the which if I do not carve most</span><br/>
<span id='161'>curiously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not find</span><br/>
<span id='162'>a woodcock too?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the</span><br/>
<span id='165'>other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,'</span><br/>
<span id='166'>said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a</span><br/>
<span id='167'>great wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.'</span><br/>
<span id='168'>'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'it</span><br/>
<span id='169'>hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='170'>is wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.'</span><br/>
<span id='171'>'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I</span><br/>
<span id='172'>believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus</span><br/>
<span id='175'>did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular</span><br/>
<span id='176'>virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou</span><br/>
<span id='177'>wast the properest man in Italy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>For the which she wept heartily and said she cared</span><br/>
<span id='179'>not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Yea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if she</span><br/>
<span id='181'>did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:</span><br/>
<span id='182'>the old man's daughter told us all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>All, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he was</span><br/>
<span id='184'>hid in the garden.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on</span><br/>
<span id='186'>the sensible Benedick's head?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick the</span><br/>
<span id='188'>married man'?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave</span><br/>
<span id='190'>you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests</span><br/>
<span id='191'>as braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank</span><br/>
<span id='193'>you: I must discontinue your company: your brother</span><br/>
<span id='194'>the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among</span><br/>
<span id='195'>you killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and, till</span><br/>
<span id='197'>then, peace be with him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>He is in earnest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for</span><br/>
<span id='200'>the love of Beatrice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>And hath challenged thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>Most sincerely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his</span><br/>
<span id='204'>doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a</span><br/>
<span id='206'>doctor to such a man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='207'>But, soft you, let me be: pluck up, my heart, and</span><br/>
<span id='208'>be sad. Did he not say, my brother was fled?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and the Watch, with CONRADE and BORACHIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='209'>Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she</span><br/>
<span id='210'>shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance: nay,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='212'>How now? two of my brother's men bound! Borachio</span><br/>
<span id='213'>one!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>Hearken after their offence, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='215'>Officers, what offence have these men done?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>Marry, sir, they have committed false report;</span><br/>
<span id='217'>moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily,</span><br/>
<span id='218'>they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have</span><br/>
<span id='219'>belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust</span><br/>
<span id='220'>things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I</span><br/>
<span id='222'>ask thee what's their offence; sixth and lastly, why</span><br/>
<span id='223'>they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay</span><br/>
<span id='224'>to their charge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='225'>Rightly reasoned, and in his own division: and, by</span><br/>
<span id='226'>my troth, there's one meaning well suited.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='227'>Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus</span><br/>
<span id='228'>bound to your answer? this learned constable is</span><br/>
<span id='229'>too cunning to be understood: what's your offence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='230'>Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer:</span><br/>
<span id='231'>do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have</span><br/>
<span id='232'>deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms</span><br/>
<span id='233'>could not discover, these shallow fools have brought</span><br/>
<span id='234'>to light: who in the night overheard me confessing</span><br/>
<span id='235'>to this man how Don John your brother incensed me</span><br/>
<span id='236'>to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into</span><br/>
<span id='237'>the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's</span><br/>
<span id='238'>garments, how you disgraced her, when you should</span><br/>
<span id='239'>marry her: my villany they have upon record; which</span><br/>
<span id='240'>I had rather seal with my death than repeat over</span><br/>

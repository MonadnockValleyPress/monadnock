<h3>Act IV, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Another part of the forest.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Alarum. Excursions. Enter FALSTAFF and COLEVILE, meeting</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>What's your name, sir? of what condition are you,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>and of what place, I pray?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>COLEVILE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of the dale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is your</span><br/>
<span id='5'>degree, and your place the dale: Colevile shall be</span><br/>
<span id='6'>still your name, a traitor your degree, and the</span><br/>
<span id='7'>dungeon your place, a place deep enough; so shall</span><br/>
<span id='8'>you be still Colevile of the dale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>COLEVILE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Are not you Sir John Falstaff?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do ye</span><br/>
<span id='11'>yield, sir? or shall I sweat for you? if I do</span><br/>
<span id='12'>sweat, they are the drops of thy lovers, and they</span><br/>
<span id='13'>weep for thy death: therefore rouse up fear and</span><br/>
<span id='14'>trembling, and do observance to my mercy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>COLEVILE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that</span><br/>
<span id='16'>thought yield me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of</span><br/>
<span id='18'>mine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any other</span><br/>
<span id='19'>word but my name. An I had but a belly of any</span><br/>
<span id='20'>indifference, I were simply the most active fellow</span><br/>
<span id='21'>in Europe: my womb, my womb, my womb, undoes me.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Here comes our general.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER, WESTMORELAND, BLUNT, and others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>The heat is past; follow no further now:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Call in the powers, good cousin Westmoreland.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit WESTMORELAND</em></p>
<span id='25'>Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?</span><br/>
<span id='26'>When every thing is ended, then you come:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>One time or other break some gallows' back.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: I</span><br/>
<span id='30'>never knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward</span><br/>
<span id='31'>of valour. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a</span><br/>
<span id='32'>bullet? have I, in my poor and old motion, the</span><br/>
<span id='33'>expedition of thought? I have speeded hither with</span><br/>
<span id='34'>the very extremest inch of possibility; I have</span><br/>
<span id='35'>foundered nine score and odd posts: and here,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>travel-tainted as I am, have in my pure and</span><br/>
<span id='37'>immaculate valour, taken Sir John Colevile of the</span><br/>
<span id='38'>dale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>But what of that? he saw me, and yielded; that I</span><br/>
<span id='40'>may justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>'I came, saw, and overcame.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>I know not: here he is, and here I yield him: and</span><br/>
<span id='44'>I beseech your grace, let it be booked with the</span><br/>
<span id='45'>rest of this day's deeds; or, by the Lord, I will</span><br/>
<span id='46'>have it in a particular ballad else, with mine own</span><br/>
<span id='47'>picture on the top on't, Colevile kissing my foot:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>to the which course if I be enforced, if you do not</span><br/>
<span id='49'>all show like gilt twopences to me, and I in the</span><br/>
<span id='50'>clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full</span><br/>
<span id='51'>moon doth the cinders of the element, which show</span><br/>
<span id='52'>like pins' heads to her, believe not the word of</span><br/>
<span id='53'>the noble: therefore let me have right, and let</span><br/>
<span id='54'>desert mount.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Thine's too heavy to mount.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Let it shine, then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Thine's too thick to shine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me</span><br/>
<span id='59'>good, and call it what you will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Is thy name Colevile?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>COLEVILE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>It is, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>A famous rebel art thou, Colevile.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>And a famous true subject took him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>COLEVILE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>I am, my lord, but as my betters are</span><br/>
<span id='65'>That led me hither: had they been ruled by me,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>You should have won them dearer than you have.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>I know not how they sold themselves: but thou, like</span><br/>
<span id='68'>a kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis; and I</span><br/>
<span id='69'>thank thee for thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter WESTMORELAND</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Now, have you left pursuit?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Retreat is made and execution stay'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Send Colevile with his confederates</span><br/>
<span id='73'>To York, to present execution:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Blunt, lead him hence; and see you guard him sure.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt BLUNT and others with COLEVILE</em></p>
<span id='75'>And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>I hear the king my father is sore sick:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Our news shall go before us to his majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Which, cousin, you shall bear to comfort him,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>And we with sober speed will follow you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>My lord, I beseech you, give me leave to go</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Through Gloucestershire: and, when you come to court,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Stand my good lord, pray, in your good report.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LANCASTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Fare you well, Falstaff: I, in my condition,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Shall better speak of you than you deserve.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but Falstaff</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than</span><br/>
<span id='86'>your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-</span><br/>
<span id='87'>blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make</span><br/>
<span id='88'>him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>There's never none of these demure boys come to any</span><br/>
<span id='90'>proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a</span><br/>
<span id='92'>kind of male green-sickness; and then when they</span><br/>
<span id='93'>marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools</span><br/>
<span id='94'>and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for</span><br/>
<span id='95'>inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold</span><br/>
<span id='96'>operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy</span><br/>
<span id='98'>vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and</span><br/>
<span id='100'>delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the</span><br/>
<span id='101'>voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes</span><br/>
<span id='102'>excellent wit. The second property of your</span><br/>
<span id='103'>excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>which, before cold and settled, left the liver</span><br/>
<span id='105'>white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity</span><br/>
<span id='106'>and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes</span><br/>
<span id='107'>it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives</span><br/>
<span id='109'>warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and</span><br/>
<span id='111'>inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>the heart, who, great and puffed up with this</span><br/>
<span id='113'>retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour</span><br/>
<span id='114'>comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is</span><br/>
<span id='115'>nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and</span><br/>
<span id='116'>learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till</span><br/>
<span id='117'>sack commences it and sets it in act and use.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for</span><br/>
<span id='119'>the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his</span><br/>
<span id='120'>father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent</span><br/>
<span id='122'>endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile</span><br/>
<span id='123'>sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If</span><br/>
<span id='124'>I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I</span><br/>
<span id='125'>would teach them should be, to forswear thin</span><br/>
<span id='126'>potations and to addict themselves to sack.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BARDOLPH</em></p>
<span id='127'>How now Bardolph?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>The army is discharged all and gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Let them go. I'll through Gloucestershire; and</span><br/>
<span id='130'>there will I visit Master Robert Shallow, esquire:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>I have him already tempering between my finger and</span><br/>
<span id='132'>my thumb, and shortly will I seal with him. Come away.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

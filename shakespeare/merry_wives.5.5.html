<blockquote>
<span id='1'>The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute</span><br/>
<span id='2'>draws on. Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me!</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love</span><br/>
<span id='4'>set on thy horns. O powerful love! that, in some</span><br/>
<span id='5'>respects, makes a beast a man, in some other, a man</span><br/>
<span id='6'>a beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love</span><br/>
<span id='7'>of Leda. O omnipotent Love! how near the god drew</span><br/>
<span id='8'>to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in</span><br/>
<span id='9'>the form of a beast. O Jove, a beastly fault! And</span><br/>
<span id='10'>then another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think</span><br/>
<span id='11'>on 't, Jove; a foul fault! When gods have hot</span><br/>
<span id='12'>backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Windsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' the</span><br/>
<span id='14'>forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can</span><br/>
<span id='15'>blame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? my</span><br/>
<span id='16'>doe?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE</em></p>

<span id='17'>Sir John! art thou there, my deer? my male deer?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain</span><br/>
<span id='19'>potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Sleeves, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes; let</span><br/>
<span id='21'>there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Divide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch: I will</span><br/>
<span id='24'>keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow</span><br/>
<span id='25'>of this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter?</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes</span><br/>
<span id='28'>restitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome!</span><br/>
<p><em>Noise within</em></p>

<span id='29'>Alas, what noise?</span><br/>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MISTRESS FORD</strong></span>

<span id='30'>Heaven forgive our sins.</span><br/>

<span id='speech8'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>

<span id='32'>Away, away!</span><br/>
<p><em>They run off</em></p>

<blockquote>
<span id='33'>I think the devil will not have me damned, lest the</span><br/>
<span id='34'>oil that's in me should set hell on fire; he would</span><br/>
<span id='35'>never else cross me thus.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SIR HUGH EVANS, disguised as before; PISTOL,  as Hobgoblin; MISTRESS QUICKLY, ANNE PAGE, and others, as Fairies, with tapers</em></p>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,</span><br/>

<span id='38'>You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Attend your office and your quality.</span><br/>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PISTOL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Where fires thou find'st unraked and hearths unswept,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I'll wink and couch: no man their works must eye.</span><br/>
<p><em>Lies down upon his face</em></p>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SIR HUGH EVANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Where's Bede? Go you, and where you find a maid</span><br/>
<span id='49'>That, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Raise up the organs of her fantasy;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Sleep she as sound as careless infancy:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>But those as sleep and think not on their sins,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides and shins.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>

<span id='54'>About, about;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>That it may stand till the perpetual doom,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Worthy the owner, and the owner it.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>The several chairs of order look you scour</span><br/>
<span id='61'>With juice of balm and every precious flower:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>The expressure that it bears, green let it be,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write</span><br/>
<span id='69'>In emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Let sapphire, pearl and rich embroidery,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Fairies use flowers for their charactery.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Away; disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Our dance of custom round about the oak</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SIR HUGH EVANS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>To guide our measure round about the tree.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>But, stay; I smell a man of middle-earth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he</span><br/>
<span id='81'>transform me to a piece of cheese!</span><br/>

<span id='speech20'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>With trial-fire touch me his finger-end:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>If he be chaste, the flame will back descend</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And turn him to no pain; but if he start,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.</span><br/>

<span id='87'>A trial, come.</span><br/>

<span id='89'>Oh, Oh, Oh!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>MISTRESS QUICKLY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!</span><br/>
<span id='91'>About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>SONG.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Fie on sinful fantasy!</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Fie on lust and luxury!</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Lust is but a bloody fire,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Kindled with unchaste desire,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Fed in heart, whose flames aspire</span><br/>
<span id='99'>As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Pinch him, fairies, mutually;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Pinch him for his villany;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.</span><br/>
<p><em>During this song they pinch FALSTAFF. DOCTOR CAIUS  comes one way, and steals away a boy in green;  SLENDER another way, and takes off a boy in white;  and FENTON comes and steals away ANN PAGE.  A noise of hunting is heard within.

<span id='110'>Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his</span><br/>
<span id='112'>horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath</span><br/>

<span id='114'>cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be</span><br/>
<span id='115'>paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for</span><br/>

<span id='speech41'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>And these are not fairies? I was three or four</span><br/>
<span id='123'>times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet</span><br/>
<span id='124'>the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my</span><br/>
<span id='125'>powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a</span><br/>
<span id='126'>received belief, in despite of the teeth of all</span><br/>
<span id='127'>rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now</span><br/>
<span id='128'>how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when 'tis upon</span><br/>

<span id='137'>it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as</span><br/>
<span id='138'>this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I</span><br/>

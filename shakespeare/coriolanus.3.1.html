<h1>Coriolanus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Rome. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the Gentry, COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LARTIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>He had, my lord; and that it was which caused</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Our swifter composition.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>So then the Volsces stand but as at first,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Upon's again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>They are worn, lord consul, so,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>That we shall hardly in our ages see</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Their banners wave again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Saw you Aufidius?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LARTIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>On safe-guard he  came to me; and did curse</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Spoke he of me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LARTIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>                  He did, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>How? what?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LARTIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>How often he had met you, sword to sword;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>That of all things upon the earth he hated</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To hopeless restitution, so he might</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Be call'd your vanquisher.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>At Antium lives he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LARTIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>At Antium.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>I wish I had a cause to seek him there,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS</em></p>
<span id='26'>Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>For they do prank them in authority,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Against all noble sufferance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Pass no further.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Ha! what is that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>It will be dangerous to go on: no further.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>What makes this change?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>The matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Cominius, no.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>                  Have I had children's voices?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>The people are incensed against him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Stop,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Or all will fall in broil.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Are these your herd?</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Must these have voices, that can yield them now</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And straight disclaim their tongues? What are</span><br/>
<span id='45'>your offices?</span><br/>
<span id='46'>You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Have you not set them on?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Be calm, be calm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>To curb the will of the nobility:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Nor ever will be ruled.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Call't not a plot:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>When corn was given them gratis, you repined;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Why, this was known before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Not to them all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Have you inform'd them sithence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>How! I inform them!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>You are like to do such business.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Not unlike,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Each way, to better yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Your fellow tribune.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>You show too much of that</span><br/>
<span id='69'>For which the people stir: if you will pass</span><br/>
<span id='70'>To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Or never be so noble as a consul,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Nor yoke with him for tribune.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Let's be calm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>The people are abused; set on. This paltering</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely</span><br/>
<span id='78'>I' the plain way of his merit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Tell me of corn!</span><br/>
<span id='80'>This was my speech, and I will speak't again&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Not now, not now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>                  Not in this heat, sir, now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>I crave their pardons:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Regard me as I do not flatter, and</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Therein behold themselves: I say again,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate</span><br/>
<span id='89'>The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>and scatter'd,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Which they have given to beggars.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Well, no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>No more words, we beseech you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>How! no more!</span><br/>
<span id='98'>As for my country I have shed my blood,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Coin words till their decay against those measles,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought</span><br/>
<span id='102'>The very way to catch them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>You speak o' the people,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>As if you were a god to punish, not</span><br/>
<span id='105'>A man of their infirmity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>'Twere well</span><br/>
<span id='107'>We let the people know't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>What, what? his choler?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Choler!</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>By Jove, 'twould be my mind!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>It is a mind</span><br/>
<span id='113'>That shall remain a poison where it is,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Not poison any further.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Shall remain!</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you</span><br/>
<span id='117'>His absolute 'shall'?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>'Twas from the canon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>'Shall'!</span><br/>
<span id='120'>O good but most unwise patricians! why,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>You grave but reckless senators, have you thus</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Given Hydra here to choose an officer,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but</span><br/>
<span id='124'>The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit</span><br/>
<span id='125'>To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>And make your channel his? If he have power</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Be not as common fools; if you are not,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>If they be senators: and they are no less,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'</span><br/>
<span id='135'>His popular 'shall' against a graver bench</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!</span><br/>
<span id='137'>It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches</span><br/>
<span id='138'>To know, when two authorities are up,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Neither supreme, how soon confusion</span><br/>
<span id='140'>May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take</span><br/>
<span id='141'>The one by the other.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Well, on to the market-place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth</span><br/>
<span id='144'>The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Sometime in Greece,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Well, well, no more of that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Though there the people had more absolute power,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed</span><br/>
<span id='149'>The ruin of the state.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Why, shall the people give</span><br/>
<span id='151'>One that speaks thus their voice?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>I'll give my reasons,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>More worthier than their voices. They know the corn</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Was not our recompense, resting well assured</span><br/>
<span id='155'>That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>They would not thread the gates. This kind of service</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Which they have often made against the senate,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>All cause unborn, could never be the motive</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?</span><br/>
<span id='164'>How shall this bisson multitude digest</span><br/>
<span id='165'>The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express</span><br/>
<span id='166'>What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>We are the greater poll, and in true fear</span><br/>
<span id='168'>They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase</span><br/>
<span id='169'>The nature of our seats and make the rabble</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Call our cares fears; which will in time</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in</span><br/>
<span id='172'>The crows to peck the eagles.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>Come, enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>Enough, with over-measure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>No, take more:</span><br/>
<span id='176'>What may be sworn by, both divine and human,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Seal what I end withal! This double worship,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Where one part does disdain with cause, the other</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Cannot conclude but by the yea and no</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Of general ignorance,&mdash;it must omit</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Real necessities, and give way the while</span><br/>
<span id='183'>To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>it follows,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='186'>You that will be less fearful than discreet,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>That love the fundamental part of state</span><br/>
<span id='188'>More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer</span><br/>
<span id='189'>A noble life before a long, and wish</span><br/>
<span id='190'>To jump a body with a dangerous physic</span><br/>
<span id='191'>That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out</span><br/>
<span id='192'>The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick</span><br/>
<span id='193'>The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Of that integrity which should become't,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Not having the power to do the good it would,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>For the in which doth control't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>Has said enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer</span><br/>
<span id='200'>As traitors do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<span id='201'>                  Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!</span><br/>
<span id='202'>What should the people do with these bald tribunes?</span><br/>
<span id='203'>On whom depending, their obedience fails</span><br/>
<span id='204'>To the greater bench: in a rebellion,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Then were they chosen: in a better hour,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Let what is meet be said it must be meet,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>And throw their power i' the dust.</span><br/>

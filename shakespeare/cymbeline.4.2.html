<h1>Cymbeline</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Before the cave of Belarius.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, and IMOGEN</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>[To IMOGEN]  You are not well: remain here in the cave;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>We'll come to you after hunting.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>[To IMOGEN]	Brother, stay here</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Are we not brothers?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>So man and man should be;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>But clay and clay differs in dignity,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>So sick I am not, yet I am not well;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>But not so citizen a wanton as</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Cannot amend me; society is no comfort</span><br/>
<span id='15'>To one not sociable: I am not very sick,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Stealing so poorly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>I love thee; I have spoke it</span><br/>
<span id='20'>How much the quantity, the weight as much,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>As I do love my father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>What! how! how!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>If it be sin to say so, I yoke me</span><br/>
<span id='24'>In my good brother's fault: I know not why</span><br/>
<span id='25'>I love this youth; and I have heard you say,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say</span><br/>
<span id='28'>'My father, not this youth.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>[Aside]	O noble strain!</span><br/>
<span id='30'>O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Cowards father cowards and base things sire base:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>I'm not their father; yet who this should be,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Doth miracle itself, loved before me.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>'Tis the ninth hour o' the morn.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Brother, farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>I wish ye sport.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>                  You health. So please you, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>[Aside]  These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies</span><br/>
<span id='40'>I have heard!</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Experience, O, thou disprovest report!</span><br/>
<span id='43'>The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>I'll now taste of thy drug.</span><br/>
<p><em>Swallows some</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>I could not stir him:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Thus did he answer me: yet said, hereafter</span><br/>
<span id='51'>I might know more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>To the field, to the field!</span><br/>
<span id='53'>We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>We'll not be long away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Pray, be not sick,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>For you must be our housewife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Well or ill,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>I am bound to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>And shalt be ever.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit IMOGEN, to the cave</em></p>
<span id='60'>This youth, how'er distress'd, appears he hath had</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Good ancestors.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>                  How angel-like he sings!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>But his neat cookery! he cut our roots</span><br/>
<span id='64'>In characters,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And sauced our broths, as Juno had been sick</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And he her dieter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Nobly he yokes</span><br/>
<span id='68'>A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Was that it was, for not being such a smile;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>The smile mocking the sigh, that it would fly</span><br/>
<span id='71'>From so divine a temple, to commix</span><br/>
<span id='72'>With winds that sailors rail at.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>I do note</span><br/>
<span id='74'>That grief and patience, rooted in him both,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Mingle their spurs together.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Grow, patience!</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine</span><br/>
<span id='78'>His perishing root with the increasing vine!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>It is great morning. Come, away!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Who's there?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CLOTEN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>I cannot find those runagates; that villain</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Hath mock'd me. I am faint.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>'Those runagates!'</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tis</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Cloten, the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>I saw him not these many years, and yet</span><br/>
<span id='87'>I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws: hence!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>He is but one: you and my brother search</span><br/>
<span id='89'>What companies are near: pray you, away;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Let me alone with him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>                  Soft! What are you</span><br/>
<span id='92'>That fly me thus? some villain mountaineers?</span><br/>
<span id='93'>I have heard of such. What slave art thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>A thing</span><br/>
<span id='95'>More slavish did I ne'er than answering</span><br/>
<span id='96'>A slave without a knock.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Thou art a robber,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I</span><br/>
<span id='100'>An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not</span><br/>
<span id='102'>My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Why I should yield to thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Thou villain base,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Know'st me not by my clothes?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>No, nor thy tailor, rascal,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Which, as it seems, make thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Thou precious varlet,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>My tailor made them not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Hence, then, and thank</span><br/>
<span id='112'>The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;</span><br/>
<span id='113'>I am loath to beat thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Thou injurious thief,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Hear but my name, and tremble.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>What's thy name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Cloten, thou villain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, or</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Adder, Spider,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>'Twould move me sooner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>To thy further fear,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know</span><br/>
<span id='124'>I am son to the queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>I am sorry for 't; not seeming</span><br/>
<span id='126'>So worthy as thy birth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Art not afeard?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Those that I reverence, those I fear, the wise:</span><br/>
<span id='129'>At fools I laugh, not fear them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Die the death:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>When I have slain thee with my proper hand,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>I'll follow those that even now fled hence,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Yield, rustic mountaineer.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt, fighting</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS</em></p>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>

<span id='135'>No companies abroad?</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='136'>None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute</span><br/>
<span id='141'>'Twas very Cloten.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>                  In this place we left them:</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Being scarce made up,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>I mean, to man, he had not apprehension</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Of roaring terrors; for the effect of judgment</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Is oft the cause of fear. But, see, thy brother.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter GUIDERIUS, with CLOTEN'S head</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;</span><br/>
<span id='150'>There was no money in't: not Hercules</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none:</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne</span><br/>
<span id='153'>My head as I do his.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>What hast thou done?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Son to the queen, after his own report;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore</span><br/>
<span id='158'>With his own single hand he'ld take us in</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Displace our heads where&mdash;thank the gods!&mdash;they grow,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>And set them on Lud's-town.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>We are all undone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>But that he swore to take, our lives? The law</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Protects not us: then why should we be tender</span><br/>
<span id='165'>To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Play judge and executioner all himself,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>For we do fear the law? What company</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Discover you abroad?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>No single soul</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason</span><br/>
<span id='171'>He must have some attendants. Though his humour</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that</span><br/>
<span id='173'>From one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, not</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Absolute madness could so far have raved</span><br/>
<span id='175'>To bring him here alone; although perhaps</span><br/>
<span id='176'>It may be heard at court that such as we</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time</span><br/>
<span id='178'>May make some stronger head; the which he hearing&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='179'>As it is like him&mdash;might break out, and swear</span><br/>
<span id='180'>He'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probable</span><br/>
<span id='181'>To come alone, either he so undertaking,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>If we do fear this body hath a tail</span><br/>
<span id='184'>More perilous than the head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>Let ordinance</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>I had no mind</span><br/>
<span id='189'>To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Did make my way long forth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>GUIDERIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>With his own sword,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en</span><br/>
<span id='193'>His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Behind our rock; and let it to the sea,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:</span><br/>

<span id='speech61'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>

<span id='speech62'><strong>ARVIRAGUS</strong></span>

<span id='200'>Would I had done't</span><br/>

<span id='202'>I love thee brotherly, but envy much</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>BELARIUS</strong></span>

<span id='206'>Well, 'tis done:</span><br/>

<span id='209'>You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay</span><br/>

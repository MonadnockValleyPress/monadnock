<h1>Timon of Athens</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene VI</h3>
<h4>The same. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Music. Tables set out: Servants attending.  Enter divers Lords, Senators and others, at several doors</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>The good time of day to you, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord</span><br/>
<span id='3'>did but try us this other day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when we</span><br/>
<span id='5'>encountered: I hope it is not so low with him as</span><br/>
<span id='6'>he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest</span><br/>
<span id='9'>inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me</span><br/>
<span id='10'>to put off; but he hath conjured me beyond them, and</span><br/>
<span id='11'>I must needs appear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>In like manner was I in debt to my importunate</span><br/>
<span id='13'>business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am</span><br/>
<span id='14'>sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my</span><br/>
<span id='15'>provision was out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all</span><br/>
<span id='17'>things go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed of</span><br/>
<span id='19'>you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>A thousand pieces.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>A thousand pieces!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>What of you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>He sent to me, sir,&mdash;Here he comes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter TIMON and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>With all my heart, gentlemen both; and how fare you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>The swallow follows not summer more willing than we</span><br/>
<span id='27'>your lordship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>[Aside]  Nor more willingly leaves winter; such</span><br/>
<span id='29'>summer-birds are men. Gentlemen, our dinner will not</span><br/>
<span id='30'>recompense this long stay: feast your ears with the</span><br/>
<span id='31'>music awhile, if they will fare so harshly o' the</span><br/>
<span id='32'>trumpet's sound; we shall to 't presently.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship</span><br/>
<span id='34'>that I returned you an empty messenger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>O, sir, let it not trouble you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>My noble lord,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Ah, my good friend, what cheer?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>that, when your lordship this other day sent to me,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>I was so unfortunate a beggar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Think not on 't, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>If you had sent but two hours before,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Let it not cumber your better remembrance.</span><br/>
<p><em>The banquet brought in</em></p>
<span id='44'>Come, bring in all together.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>All covered dishes!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Royal cheer, I warrant you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Third Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Doubt not that, if money and the season can yield</span><br/>
<span id='48'>it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>How do you? What's the news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Third Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Alcibiades is banished: hear you of it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>

<span id='speech31'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Alcibiades banished!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>Third Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>'Tis so, be sure of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>How! how!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>I pray you, upon what?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>My worthy friends, will you draw near?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>Third Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>This is the old man still.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>Third Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Will 't hold? will 't hold?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>It does: but time will&mdash;and so&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Third Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>I do conceive.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to</span><br/>
<span id='62'>the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all</span><br/>
<span id='63'>places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let</span><br/>
<span id='64'>the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with</span><br/>
<span id='67'>thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves</span><br/>
<span id='68'>praised: but reserve still to give, lest your</span><br/>
<span id='69'>deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that</span><br/>
<span id='70'>one need not lend to another; for, were your</span><br/>
<span id='71'>godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the</span><br/>
<span id='72'>gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man</span><br/>
<span id='73'>that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without</span><br/>
<span id='74'>a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at</span><br/>
<span id='75'>the table, let a dozen of them be&mdash;as they are. The</span><br/>
<span id='76'>rest of your fees, O gods&mdash;the senators of Athens,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>together with the common lag of people&mdash;what is</span><br/>
<span id='78'>amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for</span><br/>
<span id='79'>destruction. For these my present friends, as they</span><br/>
<span id='80'>are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to</span><br/>
<span id='81'>nothing are they welcome.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Uncover, dogs, and lap.</span><br/>
<p><em>The dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of warm water</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Some Speak</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>What does his lordship mean?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Some Others</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>I know not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>TIMON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>May you a better feast never behold,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm water</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Is your perfection. This is Timon's last;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Your reeking villany.</span><br/>
<p><em>Throwing the water in their faces</em></p>
<span id='91'>Live loathed and long,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks!</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Of man and beast the infinite malady</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Crust you quite o'er! What, dost thou go?</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Soft! take thy physic first&mdash;thou too&mdash;and thou;&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.</span><br/>
<p><em>Throws the dishes at them, and drives them out</em></p>
<span id='100'>What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Burn, house! sink, Athens! henceforth hated be</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Of Timon man and all humanity!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter the Lords, Senators,  & c</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>How now, my lords!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Third Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Push! did you see my cap?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>Fourth Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>I have lost my gown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>He's but a mad lord, and nought but humour sways him.</span><br/>
<span id='109'>He gave me a jewel th' other day, and now he has</span><br/>
<span id='110'>beat it out of my hat: did you see my jewel?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>Third Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Did you see my cap?</span><br/>

<span id='speech51'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>

<span id='112'>Here 'tis.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>Fourth Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Here lies my gown.</span><br/>

<span id='speech53'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Let's make no stay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Lord Timon's mad.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>Third Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I feel 't upon my bones.</span><br/>

<span id='speech56'><strong>Fourth Lord</strong></span>

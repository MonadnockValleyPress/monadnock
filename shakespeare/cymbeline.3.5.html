<h1>Cymbeline</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene V</h3>
<h4>A room in Cymbeline's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, LUCIUS, Lords, and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Thus far; and so farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CAIUS LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Thanks, royal sir.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And am right sorry that I must report ye</span><br/>
<span id='5'>My master's enemy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>                  Our subjects, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself</span><br/>
<span id='8'>To show less sovereignty than they, must needs</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Appear unkinglike.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CAIUS LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>                  So, sir: I desire of you</span><br/>
<span id='11'>A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Madam, all joy befal your grace!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>And you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>My lords, you are appointed for that office;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>The due of honour in no point omit.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>So farewell, noble Lucius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CAIUS LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Your hand, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Receive it friendly; but from this time forth</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I wear it as your enemy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CAIUS LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Sir, the event</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt LUCIUS and Lords</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>He goes hence frowning: but it honours us</span><br/>
<span id='25'>That we have given him cause.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>'Tis all the better;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor</span><br/>
<span id='29'>How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>The powers that he already hath in Gallia</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves</span><br/>
<span id='33'>His war for Britain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>'Tis not sleepy business;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Our expectation that it would be thus</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd</span><br/>
<span id='40'>The duty of the day: she looks us like</span><br/>
<span id='41'>A thing more made of malice than of duty:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>We have noted it. Call her before us; for</span><br/>
<span id='43'>We have been too slight in sufferance.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit an Attendant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Royal sir,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady</span><br/>
<span id='49'>So tender of rebukes that words are strokes</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And strokes death to her.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Attendant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Where is she, sir? How</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Can her contempt be answer'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Attendant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Please you, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer</span><br/>
<span id='55'>That will be given to the loudest noise we make.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>My lord, when last I went to visit her,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>She should that duty leave unpaid to you,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Which daily she was bound to proffer: this</span><br/>
<span id='61'>She wish'd me to make known; but our great court</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Made me to blame in memory.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Her doors lock'd?</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Prove false!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Son, I say, follow the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>have not seen these two days.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Go, look after.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit CLOTEN</em></p>
<span id='70'>Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!</span><br/>
<span id='71'>He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes</span><br/>
<span id='73'>It is a thing most precious. But for her,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown</span><br/>
<span id='76'>To her desired Posthumus: gone she is</span><br/>
<span id='77'>To death or to dishonour; and my end</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Can make good use of either: she being down,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>I have the placing of the British crown.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter CLOTEN</em></p>
<span id='80'>How now, my son!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>'Tis certain she is fled.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Go in and cheer the king: he rages; none</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Dare come about him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>[Aside]            All the better: may</span><br/>
<span id='85'>This night forestall him of the coming day!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Than lady, ladies, woman; from every one</span><br/>
<span id='89'>The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Disdaining me and throwing favours on</span><br/>
<span id='92'>The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment</span><br/>
<span id='93'>That what's else rare is choked; and in that point</span><br/>
<span id='94'>I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PISANIO</em></p>
<span id='96'>Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Come hither: ah, you precious pander! Villain,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Where is thy lady? In a word; or else</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Thou art straightway with the fiends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>O, good my lord!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>I will not ask again. Close villain,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?</span><br/>
<span id='105'>From whose so many weights of baseness cannot</span><br/>
<span id='106'>A dram of worth be drawn.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Alas, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>How can she be with him? When was she missed?</span><br/>
<span id='109'>He is in Rome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>                  Where is she, sir? Come nearer;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>No further halting: satisfy me home</span><br/>
<span id='112'>What is become of her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>O, my all-worthy lord!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>All-worthy villain!</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Discover where thy mistress is at once,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Speak, or thy silence on the instant is</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Thy condemnation and thy death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Then, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>This paper is the history of my knowledge</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Touching her flight.</span><br/>
<p><em>Presenting a letter</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Let's see't. I will pursue her</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Even to Augustus' throne.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>[Aside]                 Or this, or perish.</span><br/>
<span id='125'>She's far enough; and what he learns by this</span><br/>
<span id='126'>May prove his travel, not her danger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Hum!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>[Aside]  I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Sirrah, is this letter true?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Sir, as I think.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou</span><br/>
<span id='133'>wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>undergo those employments wherein I should have</span><br/>
<span id='135'>cause to use thee with a serious industry, that is,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it</span><br/>
<span id='137'>directly and truly, I would think thee an honest</span><br/>
<span id='138'>man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy</span><br/>
<span id='139'>relief nor my voice for thy preferment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Well, my good lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently and</span><br/>
<span id='142'>constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of</span><br/>
<span id='143'>that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the</span><br/>
<span id='144'>course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of</span><br/>
<span id='145'>mine: wilt thou serve me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Sir, I will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy</span><br/>
<span id='148'>late master's garments in thy possession?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he</span><br/>
<span id='150'>wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit</span><br/>
<span id='152'>hither: let it be thy lint service; go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>I shall, my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Meet thee at Milford-Haven!&mdash;I forgot to ask him one</span><br/>
<span id='155'>thing; I'll remember't anon:&mdash;even there, thou</span><br/>
<span id='156'>villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these</span><br/>
<span id='157'>garments were come. She said upon a time&mdash;the</span><br/>
<span id='158'>bitterness of it I now belch from my heart&mdash;that she</span><br/>
<span id='159'>held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect</span><br/>
<span id='160'>than my noble and natural person together with the</span><br/>
<span id='161'>adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my</span><br/>
<span id='162'>back, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in her</span><br/>
<span id='163'>eyes; there shall she see my valour, which will then</span><br/>
<span id='164'>be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my</span><br/>
<span id='165'>speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and</span><br/>
<span id='166'>when my lust hath dined,&mdash;which, as I say, to vex</span><br/>
<span id='167'>her I will execute in the clothes that she so</span><br/>
<span id='168'>praised,&mdash;to the court I'll knock her back, foot</span><br/>
<span id='169'>her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>and I'll be merry in my revenge.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothes</em></p>
<span id='171'>Be those the garments?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Ay, my noble lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>She can scarce be there yet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second</span><br/>
<span id='176'>thing that I have commanded thee: the third is,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be</span><br/>
<span id='178'>but duteous, and true preferment shall tender itself</span><br/>
<span id='179'>to thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I had</span><br/>
<span id='180'>wings to follow it! Come, and be true.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>

<span id='181'>Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Were to prove false, which I will never be,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>To him that is most true. To Milford go,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Be cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Another part of the field.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and a British Lord</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Camest thou from where they made the stand?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>I did.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>I did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>But that the heavens fought: the king himself</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Of his wings destitute, the army broken,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work</span><br/>
<span id='11'>More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd</span><br/>
<span id='14'>With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living</span><br/>
<span id='15'>To die with lengthen'd shame.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Where was this lane?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>An honest one, I warrant; who deserved</span><br/>
<span id='20'>So long a breeding as his white beard came to,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>He, with two striplings-lads more like to run</span><br/>
<span id='23'>The country base than to commit such slaughter</span><br/>
<span id='24'>With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Than those for preservation cased, or shame&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Or we are Romans and will give you that</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'</span><br/>
<span id='32'>These three,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Three thousand confident, in act as many&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>For three performers are the file when all</span><br/>
<span id='35'>The rest do nothing&mdash;with this word 'Stand, stand,'</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Accommodated by the place, more charming</span><br/>
<span id='37'>With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd</span><br/>
<span id='38'>A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>turn'd coward</span><br/>
<span id='41'>But by example&mdash;O, a sin in war,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Damn'd in the first beginners!&mdash;gan to look</span><br/>
<span id='43'>The way that they did, and to grin like lions</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began</span><br/>
<span id='45'>A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon</span><br/>
<span id='46'>A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Like fragments in hard voyages, became</span><br/>
<span id='50'>The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Some slain before; some dying; some their friends</span><br/>
<span id='53'>O'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Those that would die or ere resist are grown</span><br/>
<span id='56'>The mortal bugs o' the field.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>This was strange chance</span><br/>
<span id='58'>A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Rather to wonder at the things you hear</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Nay, be not angry, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>'Lack, to what end?</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>For if he'll do as he is made to do,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>You have put me into rhyme.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Farewell; you're angry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Still going?</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Lord</em></p>
<span id='73'>This is a lord! O noble misery,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!</span><br/>
<span id='75'>To-day how many would have given their honours</span><br/>
<span id='76'>To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Could not find death where I did hear him groan,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we</span><br/>
<span id='82'>That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him</span><br/>
<span id='83'>For being now a favourer to the Briton,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>No more a Briton, I have resumed again</span><br/>
<span id='85'>The part I came in: fight I will no more,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>But yield me to the veriest hind that shall</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Here made by the Roman; great the answer be</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>On either side I come to spend my breath;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>But end it by some means for Imogen.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter two British Captains and Soldiers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>First Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Second Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>That gave the affront with them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>So 'tis reported:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>A Roman,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Had answer'd him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Second Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>                  Lay hands on him; a dog!</span><br/>
<span id='103'>A leg of Rome shall not return to tell</span><br/>
<span id='104'>What crows have peck'd them here. He brags</span><br/>
<span id='105'>his service</span><br/>
<span id='106'>As if he were of note: bring him to the king.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS,  PISANIO, Soldiers, Attendants, and Roman Captives.  The Captains present POSTHUMUS LEONATUS to  CYMBELINE, who delivers him over to a Gaoler: then exeunt omnes</em></p>

<h1>Richard II</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene IV</H3>
<h4>The court.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING RICHARD II, with BAGOT and GREEN at one door; and the DUKE OF AUMERLE at another</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>How far brought you high Hereford on his way?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>But to the next highway, and there I left him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>And say, what store of parting tears were shed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Which then blew bitterly against our faces,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>What said our cousin when you parted with him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>'Farewell:'</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And, for my heart disdained that my tongue</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Should so profane the word, that taught me craft</span><br/>
<span id='14'>To counterfeit oppression of such grief</span><br/>
<span id='15'>That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And added years to his short banishment,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>He should have had a volume of farewells;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>But since it would not, he had none of me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>When time shall call him home from banishment,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Observed his courtship to the common people;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>How he did seem to dive into their hearts</span><br/>
<span id='26'>With humble and familiar courtesy,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>What reverence he did throw away on slaves,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And patient underbearing of his fortune,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>As 'twere to banish their affects with him.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>A brace of draymen bid God speed him well</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And had the tribute of his supple knee,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'</span><br/>
<span id='35'>As were our England in reversion his,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And he our subjects' next degree in hope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>GREEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Expedient manage must be made, my liege,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Ere further leisure yield them further means</span><br/>
<span id='41'>For their advantage and your highness' loss.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>We will ourself in person to this war:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And, for our coffers, with too great a court</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>We are inforced to farm our royal realm;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>The revenue whereof shall furnish us</span><br/>
<span id='47'>For our affairs in hand: if that come short,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And send them after to supply our wants;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>For we will make for Ireland presently.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BUSHY</em></p>
<span id='53'>Bushy, what news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BUSHY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste</span><br/>
<span id='56'>To entreat your majesty to visit him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Where lies he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BUSHY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>At Ely House.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Now put it, God, in the physician's mind</span><br/>
<span id='60'>To help him to his grave immediately!</span><br/>
<span id='61'>The lining of his coffers shall make coats</span><br/>
<span id='62'>To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>All</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Amen.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

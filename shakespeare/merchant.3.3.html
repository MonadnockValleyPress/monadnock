<h1>The Merchant of Venice</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Venice. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter SHYLOCK, SALARINO, ANTONIO, and Gaoler</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>This is the fool that lent out money gratis:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Gaoler, look to him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Hear me yet, good Shylock.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To come abroad with him at his request.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>I pray thee, hear me speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield</span><br/>
<span id='17'>To Christian intercessors. Follow not;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SALARINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>It is the most impenetrable cur</span><br/>
<span id='20'>That ever kept with men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Let him alone:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>He seeks my life; his reason well I know:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Many that have at times made moan to me;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Therefore he hates me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SALARINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>I am sure the duke</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>The duke cannot deny the course of law:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>For the commodity that strangers have</span><br/>
<span id='31'>With us in Venice, if it be denied,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Will much impeach the justice of his state;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Since that the trade and profit of the city</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>These griefs and losses have so bated me,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh</span><br/>
<span id='37'>To-morrow to my bloody creditor.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

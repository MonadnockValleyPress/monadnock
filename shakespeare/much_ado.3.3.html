<h1>Much Ado About Nothing</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene III</h3>
<h4>A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Are you good men and true?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>VERGES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer</span><br/>
<span id='3'>salvation, body and soul.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if</span><br/>
<span id='5'>they should have any allegiance in them, being</span><br/>
<span id='6'>chosen for the prince's watch.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>VERGES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>First, who think you the most desertless man to be</span><br/>
<span id='9'>constable?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>First Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they can</span><br/>
<span id='11'>write and read.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed</span><br/>
<span id='13'>you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is</span><br/>
<span id='14'>the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Second Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Both which, master constable,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make</span><br/>
<span id='18'>no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>let that appear when there is no need of such</span><br/>
<span id='20'>vanity. You are thought here to be the most</span><br/>
<span id='21'>senseless and fit man for the constable of the</span><br/>
<span id='22'>watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your</span><br/>
<span id='23'>charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are</span><br/>
<span id='24'>to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Second Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>How if a' will not stand?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and</span><br/>
<span id='27'>presently call the rest of the watch together and</span><br/>
<span id='28'>thank God you are rid of a knave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>VERGES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none</span><br/>
<span id='30'>of the prince's subjects.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>True, and they are to meddle with none but the</span><br/>
<span id='32'>prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in</span><br/>
<span id='33'>the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to</span><br/>
<span id='34'>talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>We will rather sleep than talk: we know what</span><br/>
<span id='36'>belongs to a watch.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet</span><br/>
<span id='38'>watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should</span><br/>
<span id='39'>offend: only, have a care that your bills be not</span><br/>
<span id='40'>stolen. Well, you are to call at all the</span><br/>
<span id='41'>ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>How if they will not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if</span><br/>
<span id='44'>they make you not then the better answer, you may</span><br/>
<span id='45'>say they are not the men you took them for.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Well, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue</span><br/>
<span id='48'>of your office, to be no true man; and, for such</span><br/>
<span id='49'>kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>why the more is for your honesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay</span><br/>
<span id='52'>hands on him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they</span><br/>
<span id='54'>that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable</span><br/>
<span id='55'>way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him</span><br/>
<span id='56'>show himself what he is and steal out of your company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>VERGES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>You have been always called a merciful man, partner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more</span><br/>
<span id='59'>a man who hath any honesty in him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>VERGES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call</span><br/>
<span id='61'>to the nurse and bid her still it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake</span><br/>
<span id='64'>her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her</span><br/>
<span id='65'>lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>VERGES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>'Tis very true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>This is the end of the charge:&mdash;you, constable, are</span><br/>
<span id='68'>to present the prince's own person: if you meet the</span><br/>
<span id='69'>prince in the night, you may stay him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>VERGES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows</span><br/>
<span id='72'>the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without</span><br/>
<span id='73'>the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought</span><br/>
<span id='74'>to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a</span><br/>
<span id='75'>man against his will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>VERGES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>By'r lady, I think it be so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be</span><br/>
<span id='78'>any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your</span><br/>
<span id='79'>fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Come, neighbour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here</span><br/>
<span id='82'>upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch</span><br/>
<span id='84'>about Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being</span><br/>
<span id='85'>there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Adieu: be vigilant, I beseech you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES</em></p>
<p><em>Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>What Conrade!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>[Aside]  Peace! stir not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Conrade, I say!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Here, man; I am at thy elbow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a</span><br/>
<span id='92'>scab follow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forward</span><br/>
<span id='94'>with thy tale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, for</span><br/>
<span id='96'>it drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>utter all to thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>[Aside]  Some treason, masters: yet stand close.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any</span><br/>
<span id='102'>villany should be so rich; for when rich villains</span><br/>
<span id='103'>have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what</span><br/>
<span id='104'>price they will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>I wonder at it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that</span><br/>
<span id='107'>the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is</span><br/>
<span id='108'>nothing to a man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Yes, it is apparel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>I mean, the fashion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Yes, the fashion is the fashion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But</span><br/>
<span id='113'>seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion</span><br/>
<span id='114'>is?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>[Aside]  I know that Deformed; a' has been a vile</span><br/>
<span id='116'>thief this seven year; a' goes up and down like a</span><br/>
<span id='117'>gentleman: I remember his name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Didst thou not hear somebody?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>No; 'twas the vane on the house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this</span><br/>
<span id='121'>fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot</span><br/>
<span id='122'>bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?</span><br/>
<span id='123'>sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers</span><br/>
<span id='124'>in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's</span><br/>
<span id='125'>priests in the old church-window, sometime like the</span><br/>
<span id='126'>shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears</span><br/>
<span id='129'>out more apparel than the man. But art not thou</span><br/>
<span id='130'>thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast</span><br/>
<span id='131'>shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night</span><br/>
<span id='133'>wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the</span><br/>
<span id='134'>name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'</span><br/>
<span id='135'>chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good</span><br/>
<span id='136'>night,&mdash;I tell this tale vilely:&mdash;I should first</span><br/>
<span id='137'>tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>planted and placed and possessed by my master Don</span><br/>
<span id='139'>John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>And thought they Margaret was Hero?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the</span><br/>
<span id='142'>devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly</span><br/>
<span id='143'>by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by</span><br/>
<span id='144'>the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly</span><br/>
<span id='145'>by my villany, which did confirm any slander that</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore</span><br/>
<span id='147'>he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning</span><br/>
<span id='148'>at the temple, and there, before the whole</span><br/>
<span id='149'>congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night</span><br/>
<span id='150'>and send her home again without a husband.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>First Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>Second Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Call up the right master constable. We have here</span><br/>
<span id='153'>recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that</span><br/>
<span id='154'>ever was known in the commonwealth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>First Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>And one Deformed is one of them: I know him; a'</span><br/>
<span id='156'>wears a lock.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Masters, masters,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>Second Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Masters,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>First Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken</span><br/>
<span id='162'>up of these men's bills.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

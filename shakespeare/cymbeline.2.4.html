<h1>Cymbeline</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Rome. Philario's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Fear it not, sir: I would I were so sure</span><br/>
<span id='2'>To win the king as I am bold her honour</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Will remain hers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PHILARIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>                  What means do you make to him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Not any, but abide the change of time,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Quake in the present winter's state and wish</span><br/>
<span id='7'>That warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>I barely gratify your love; they failing,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>I must die much your debtor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PHILARIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Your very goodness and your company</span><br/>
<span id='11'>O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Will do's commission throughly: and I think</span><br/>
<span id='14'>He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Is yet fresh in their grief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>I do believe,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Statist though I am none, nor like to be,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>That this will prove a war; and you shall hear</span><br/>
<span id='20'>The legions now in Gallia sooner landed</span><br/>
<span id='21'>In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Smiled at their lack of skill, but found</span><br/>
<span id='25'>their courage</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Worthy his frowning at: their discipline,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Now mingled with their courages, will make known</span><br/>
<span id='28'>To their approvers they are people such</span><br/>
<span id='29'>That mend upon the world.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter IACHIMO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PHILARIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>See! Iachimo!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>The swiftest harts have posted you by land;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>To make your vessel nimble.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PHILARIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Welcome, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>I hope the briefness of your answer made</span><br/>
<span id='36'>The speediness of your return.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Your lady</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>And therewithal the best; or let her beauty</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Look through a casement to allure false hearts</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And be false with them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Here are letters for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Their tenor good, I trust.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>'Tis very like.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PHILARIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court</span><br/>
<span id='46'>When you were there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>He was expected then,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>But not approach'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>All is well yet.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Too dull for your good wearing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>If I had lost it,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>I should have lost the worth of it in gold.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy</span><br/>
<span id='55'>A second night of such sweet shortness which</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>The stone's too hard to come by.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Not a whit,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Your lady being so easy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Make not, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Your loss your sport: I hope you know that we</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Must not continue friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Good sir, we must,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>If you keep covenant. Had I not brought</span><br/>
<span id='65'>The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant</span><br/>
<span id='66'>We were to question further: but I now</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Profess myself the winner of her honour,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Together with your ring; and not the wronger</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Of her or you, having proceeded but</span><br/>
<span id='70'>By both your wills.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>If you can make't apparent</span><br/>
<span id='72'>That you have tasted her in bed, my hand</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion</span><br/>
<span id='74'>You had of her pure honour gains or loses</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both</span><br/>
<span id='76'>To who shall find them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Sir, my circumstances,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Being so near the truth as I will make them,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Must first induce you to believe: whose strength</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find</span><br/>
<span id='82'>You need it not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>                  Proceed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>First, her bedchamber,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Had that was well worth watching&mdash;it was hang'd</span><br/>
<span id='87'>With tapesty of silk and silver; the story</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for</span><br/>
<span id='90'>The press of boats or pride: a piece of work</span><br/>
<span id='91'>So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive</span><br/>
<span id='92'>In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Since the true life on't was&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>This is true;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And this you might have heard of here, by me,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Or by some other.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>More particulars</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Must justify my knowledge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>So they must,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Or do your honour injury.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>The chimney</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures</span><br/>
<span id='105'>So likely to report themselves: the cutter</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Motion and breath left out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>This is a thing</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Which you might from relation likewise reap,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Being, as it is, much spoke of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>The roof o' the chamber</span><br/>
<span id='112'>With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='113'>I had forgot them&mdash;were two winking Cupids</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Depending on their brands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>This is her honour!</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Let it be granted you have seen all this&mdash;and praise</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Be given to your remembrance&mdash;the description</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Of what is in her chamber nothing saves</span><br/>
<span id='120'>The wager you have laid.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Then, if you can,</span><br/>
<p><em>Showing the bracelet</em></p>
<span id='122'>Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!</span><br/>
<span id='123'>And now 'tis up again: it must be married</span><br/>
<span id='124'>To that your diamond; I'll keep them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Jove!</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Once more let me behold it: is it that</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Which I left with her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Sir&mdash;I thank her&mdash;that:</span><br/>
<span id='129'>She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Her pretty action did outsell her gift,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and said</span><br/>
<span id='132'>She prized it once.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>May be she pluck'd it off</span><br/>
<span id='134'>To send it me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>She writes so to you, doth she?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;</span><br/>
<p><em>Gives the ring</em></p>
<span id='137'>It is a basilisk unto mine eye,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Where there's another man: the vows of women</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing.</span><br/>
<span id='143'>O, above measure false!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PHILARIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Have patience, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:</span><br/>
<span id='146'>It may be probable she lost it; or</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Hath stol'n it from her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Very true;</span><br/>
<span id='150'>And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Render to me some corporal sign about her,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>More evident than this; for this was stolen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.</span><br/>
<span id='155'>'Tis true:&mdash;nay, keep the ring&mdash;'tis true: I am sure</span><br/>
<span id='156'>She would not lose it: her attendants are</span><br/>
<span id='157'>All sworn and honourable:&mdash;they induced to steal it!</span><br/>
<span id='158'>And by a stranger!&mdash;No, he hath enjoyed her:</span><br/>
<span id='159'>The cognizance of her incontinency</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Is this: she hath bought the name of whore</span><br/>
<span id='161'>thus dearly.</span><br/>
<span id='162'>There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Divide themselves between you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>PHILARIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Sir, be patient:</span><br/>
<span id='165'>This is not strong enough to be believed</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Of one persuaded well of&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>Never talk on't;</span><br/>
<span id='168'>She hath been colted by him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>If you seek</span><br/>
<span id='170'>For further satisfying, under her breast&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Worthy the pressing&mdash;lies a mole, right proud</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger</span><br/>
<span id='174'>To feed again, though full. You do remember</span><br/>
<span id='175'>This stain upon her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>Ay, and it doth confirm</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Another stain, as big as hell can hold,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Were there no more but it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Will you hear more?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Once, and a million!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>I'll be sworn&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>No swearing.</span><br/>
<span id='184'>If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;</span><br/>
<span id='185'>And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Thou'st made me cuckold.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>I'll deny nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!</span><br/>
<span id='189'>I will go there and do't, i' the court, before</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Her father. I'll do something&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>PHILARIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>Quite besides</span><br/>
<span id='192'>The government of patience! You have won:</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath</span><br/>
<span id='194'>He hath against himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>IACHIMO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>With an my heart.</span><br/>

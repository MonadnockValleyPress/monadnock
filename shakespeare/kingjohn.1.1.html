<h1>King John</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>King John's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING JOHN, QUEEN ELINOR, PEMBROKE, ESSEX, SALISBURY, and others, with CHATILLON</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CHATILLON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France</span><br/>
<span id='3'>In my behavior to the majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>The borrow'd majesty, of England here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>QUEEN ELINOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>A strange beginning: 'borrow'd majesty!'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CHATILLON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Philip of France, in right and true behalf</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To this fair island and the territories,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Desiring thee to lay aside the sword</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Which sways usurpingly these several titles,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And put these same into young Arthur's hand,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>What follows if we disallow of this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CHATILLON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>The proud control of fierce and bloody war,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Here have we war for war and blood for blood,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Controlment for controlment: so answer France.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CHATILLON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>The farthest limit of my embassy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>For ere thou canst report I will be there,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And sullen presage of your own decay.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>An honourable conduct let him have:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Pembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt CHATILLON and PEMBROKE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>QUEEN ELINOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>What now, my son! have I not ever said</span><br/>
<span id='32'>How that ambitious Constance would not cease</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Till she had kindled France and all the world,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Upon the right and party of her son?</span><br/>
<span id='35'>This might have been prevented and made whole</span><br/>
<span id='36'>With very easy arguments of love,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Which now the manage of two kingdoms must</span><br/>
<span id='38'>With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Our strong possession and our right for us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>QUEEN ELINOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Your strong possession much more than your right,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Or else it must go wrong with you and me:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>So much my conscience whispers in your ear,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Sheriff</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ESSEX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>My liege, here is the strangest controversy</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Come from country to be judged by you,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Let them approach.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Our abbeys and our priories shall pay</span><br/>
<span id='49'>This expedition's charge.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ROBERT and the BASTARD</em></p>
<span id='50'>What men are you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BASTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Your faithful subject I, a gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>A soldier, by the honour-giving hand</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>What art thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ROBERT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?</span><br/>
<span id='59'>You came not of one mother then, it seems.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BASTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Most certain of one mother, mighty king;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>That is well known; and, as I think, one father:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>But for the certain knowledge of that truth</span><br/>
<span id='63'>I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>QUEEN ELINOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And wound her honour with this diffidence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BASTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>That is my brother's plea and none of mine;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>The which if he can prove, a' pops me out</span><br/>
<span id='70'>At least from fair five hundred pound a year:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BASTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>I know not why, except to get the land.</span><br/>
<span id='75'>But once he slander'd me with bastardy:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>But whether I be as true begot or no,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>That still I lay upon my mother's head,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>But that I am as well begot, my liege,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Compare our faces and be judge yourself.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>If old sir Robert did beget us both</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And were our father and this son like him,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>O old sir Robert, father, on my knee</span><br/>
<span id='84'>I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>QUEEN ELINOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>The accent of his tongue affecteth him.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Do you not read some tokens of my son</span><br/>
<span id='89'>In the large composition of this man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Mine eye hath well examined his parts</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>What doth move you to claim your brother's land?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BASTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Because he hath a half-face, like my father.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>With half that face would he have all my land:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ROBERT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>My gracious liege, when that my father lived,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Your brother did employ my father much,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>BASTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>ROBERT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>And once dispatch'd him in an embassy</span><br/>
<span id='101'>To Germany, there with the emperor</span><br/>
<span id='102'>To treat of high affairs touching that time.</span><br/>
<span id='103'>The advantage of his absence took the king</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Between my father and my mother lay,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>As I have heard my father speak himself,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>When this same lusty gentleman was got.</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd</span><br/>
<span id='111'>His lands to me, and took it on his death</span><br/>
<span id='112'>That this my mother's son was none of his;</span><br/>
<span id='113'>And if he were, he came into the world</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>My father's land, as was my father's will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And if she did play false, the fault was hers;</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands</span><br/>
<span id='121'>That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Had of your father claim'd this son for his?</span><br/>
<span id='124'>In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept</span><br/>
<span id='125'>This calf bred from his cow from all the world;</span><br/>
<span id='126'>In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>My brother might not claim him; nor your father,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>My mother's son did get your father's heir;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Your father's heir must have your father's land.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>ROBERT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Shall then my father's will be of no force</span><br/>
<span id='132'>To dispossess that child which is not his?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>BASTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Than was his will to get me, as I think.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>QUEEN ELINOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Lord of thy presence and no land beside?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>BASTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Madam, an if my brother had my shape,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>And if my legs were two such riding-rods,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin</span><br/>
<span id='143'>That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Would I might never stir from off this place,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>I would give it every foot to have this face;</span><br/>
<span id='148'>I would not be sir Nob in any case.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>QUEEN ELINOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?</span><br/>
<span id='151'>I am a soldier and now bound to France.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>BASTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>QUEEN ELINOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Nay, I would have you go before me thither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BASTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Our country manners give our betters way.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>What is thy name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BASTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st:</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BASTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:</span><br/>
<span id='165'>My father gave me honour, yours gave land.</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>When I was got, sir Robert was away!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>QUEEN ELINOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>The very spirit of Plantagenet!</span><br/>
<span id='169'>I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BASTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Something about, a little from the right,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>And have is have, however men do catch:</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Near or far off, well won is still well shot,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>And I am I, howe'er I was begot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;</span><br/>
<span id='178'>A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed</span><br/>
<span id='180'>For France, for France, for it is more than need.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BASTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!</span><br/>
<span id='182'>For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but BASTARD</em></p>
<span id='183'>A foot of honour better than I was;</span><br/>
<span id='184'>But many a many foot of land the worse.</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.</span><br/>
<span id='186'>'Good den, sir Richard!'&mdash;'God-a-mercy, fellow!'&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='187'>And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;</span><br/>
<span id='188'>For new-made honour doth forget men's names;</span><br/>
<span id='189'>'Tis too respective and too sociable</span><br/>
<span id='190'>For your conversion. Now your traveller,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Why then I suck my teeth and catechise</span><br/>
<span id='194'>My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>'I shall beseech you'&mdash;that is question now;</span><br/>
<span id='197'>And then comes answer like an Absey book:</span><br/>
<span id='198'>'O sir,' says answer, 'at your best command;</span><br/>
<span id='199'>At your employment; at your service, sir;'</span><br/>
<span id='200'>'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'</span><br/>
<span id='201'>And so, ere answer knows what question would,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Saving in dialogue of compliment,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>And talking of the Alps and Apennines,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>The Pyrenean and the river Po,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>It draws toward supper in conclusion so.</span><br/>
<span id='206'>But this is worshipful society</span><br/>
<span id='207'>And fits the mounting spirit like myself,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>For he is but a bastard to the time</span><br/>
<span id='209'>That doth not smack of observation;</span><br/>
<span id='210'>And so am I, whether I smack or no;</span><br/>
<span id='211'>And not alone in habit and device,</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Exterior form, outward accoutrement,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>But from the inward motion to deliver</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Which, though I will not practise to deceive,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;</span><br/>
<span id='217'>For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.</span><br/>
<span id='218'>But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?</span><br/>
<span id='219'>What woman-post is this? hath she no husband</span><br/>
<span id='220'>That will take pains to blow a horn before her?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and GURNEY</em></p>
<span id='221'>O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!</span><br/>
<span id='222'>What brings you here to court so hastily?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LADY FAULCONBRIDGE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='223'>Where is that slave, thy brother? where is he,</span><br/>
<span id='224'>That holds in chase mine honour up and down?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>BASTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='225'>My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?</span><br/>

<span id='234'>There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit GURNEY</em></p>
<span id='235'>Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:</span><br/>
<span id='236'>Sir Robert might have eat his part in me</span><br/>
<span id='237'>Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:</span><br/>
<span id='238'>Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,</span><br/>
<span id='239'>Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:</span><br/>
<span id='240'>We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,</span><br/>
<span id='241'>To whom am I beholding for these limbs?</span><br/>

<span id='246'>Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.</span><br/>
<span id='247'>What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.</span><br/>
<span id='248'>But, mother, I am not sir Robert's son;</span><br/>
<span id='249'>I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;</span><br/>
<span id='250'>Legitimation, name and all is gone:</span><br/>

<span id='265'>Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,</span><br/>
<span id='266'>Subjected tribute to commanding love,</span><br/>
<span id='267'>Against whose fury and unmatched force</span><br/>
<span id='268'>The aweless lion could not wage the fight,</span><br/>
<span id='269'>Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.</span><br/>
<span id='270'>He that perforce robs lions of their hearts</span><br/>
<span id='271'>May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,</span><br/>
<span id='272'>With all my heart I thank thee for my father!</span><br/>
<span id='273'>Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well</span><br/>
<span id='274'>When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.</span><br/>
<span id='275'>Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;</span><br/>
<span id='276'>And they shall say, when Richard me begot,</span><br/>
<span id='277'>If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:</span><br/>
<span id='278'>Who says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not.</span><br/>

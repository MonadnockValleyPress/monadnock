<h1>King Lear</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene VII</h3>
<h4>A tent in the French camp.</h4>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Lear on a bed asleep, soft music playing; Gentleman, and others attending.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Enter CORDELIA, KENT, and Doctor</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And every measure fail me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>All my reports go with the modest truth;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Be better suited:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>These weeds are memories of those worser hours:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>I prithee, put them off.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Pardon me, dear madam;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Yet to be known shortens my made intent:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>My boon I make it, that you know me not</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Till time and I think meet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Then be't so, my good lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>To the Doctor</em></p>
<span id='15'>How does the king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Madam, sleeps still.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>O you kind gods,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Cure this great breach in his abused nature!</span><br/>
<span id='19'>The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Of this child-changed father!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>So please your majesty</span><br/>
<span id='22'>That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Ay, madam; in the heaviness of his sleep</span><br/>
<span id='26'>We put fresh garments on him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I doubt not of his temperance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Very well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Please you, draw near. Louder the music there!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>O my dear father! Restoration hang</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Repair those violent harms that my two sisters</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Have in thy reverence made!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Kind and dear princess!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Had you not been their father, these white flakes</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face</span><br/>
<span id='38'>To be opposed against the warring winds?</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?</span><br/>
<span id='40'>In the most terrible and nimble stroke</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Of quick, cross lightning? to watch&mdash;poor perdu!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Though he had bit me, should have stood that night</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!</span><br/>
<span id='47'>'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Do scald like moulten lead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Sir, do you know me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Still, still, far wide!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?</span><br/>
<span id='60'>I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>To see another thus. I know not what to say.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Of my condition!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>                  O, look upon me, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>No, sir, you must not kneel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Pray, do not mock me:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>I am a very foolish fond old man,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And, to deal plainly,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>I fear I am not in my perfect mind.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Methinks I should know you, and know this man;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant</span><br/>
<span id='75'>What place this is; and all the skill I have</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Remembers not these garments; nor I know not</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>For, as I am a man, I think this lady</span><br/>
<span id='79'>To be my child Cordelia.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>And so I am, I am.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Be your tears wet? yes, 'faith. I pray, weep not:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>If you have poison for me, I will drink it.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>I know you do not love me; for your sisters</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>You have some cause, they have not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>No cause, no cause.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Am I in France?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>                  In your own kingdom, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Do not abuse me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Doctor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger</span><br/>
<span id='92'>To make him even o'er the time he has lost.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Desire him to go in; trouble him no more</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Till further settling.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Will't please your highness walk?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>You must bear with me:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but KENT and Gentleman</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Most certain, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Who is conductor of his people?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl</span><br/>
<span id='103'>of Kent in Germany.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the</span><br/>
<span id='105'>powers of the kingdom approach apace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare you</span><br/>
<span id='107'>well, sir.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>My point and period will be throughly wrought,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

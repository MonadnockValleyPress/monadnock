<h1>Hamlet</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</h3>
<h4>A room in the castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Moreover that we much did long to see you,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>The need we have to use you did provoke</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Our hasty sending. Something have you heard</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Resembles that it was. What it should be,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>More than his father's death, that thus hath put him</span><br/>
<span id='9'>So much from the understanding of himself,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>That, being of so young days brought up with him,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Some little time: so by your companies</span><br/>
<span id='15'>To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>So much as from occasion you may glean,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>That, open'd, lies within our remedy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And sure I am two men there are not living</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To whom he more adheres. If it will please you</span><br/>
<span id='22'>To show us so much gentry and good will</span><br/>
<span id='23'>As to expend your time with us awhile,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>For the supply and profit of our hope,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Your visitation shall receive such thanks</span><br/>
<span id='26'>As fits a king's remembrance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Both your majesties</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Put your dread pleasures more into command</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Than to entreaty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>                  But we both obey,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And here give up ourselves, in the full bent</span><br/>
<span id='33'>To lay our service freely at your feet,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>To be commanded.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And I beseech you instantly to visit</span><br/>
<span id='38'>My too much changed son. Go, some of you,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Heavens make our presence and our practises</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Pleasant and helpful to him!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Ay, amen!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants</em></p>
<p><em>Enter POLONIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Are joyfully return'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Thou still hast been the father of good news.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Both to my God and to my gracious king:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And I do think, or else this brain of mine</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Hunts not the trail of policy so sure</span><br/>
<span id='51'>As it hath used to do, that I have found</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Give first admittance to the ambassadors;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit POLONIUS</em></p>
<span id='57'>He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found</span><br/>
<span id='58'>The head and source of all your son's distemper.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>I doubt it is no other but the main;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Well, we shall sift him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</em></p>
<span id='62'>Welcome, my good friends!</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>VOLTIMAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Most fair return of greetings and desires.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Upon our first, he sent out to suppress</span><br/>
<span id='66'>His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd</span><br/>
<span id='67'>To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>But, better look'd into, he truly found</span><br/>
<span id='69'>It was against your highness: whereat grieved,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>That so his sickness, age and impotence</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests</span><br/>
<span id='72'>On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Makes vow before his uncle never more</span><br/>
<span id='75'>To give the assay of arms against your majesty.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And his commission to employ those soldiers,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>So levied as before, against the Polack:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>With an entreaty, herein further shown,</span><br/>
<p><em>Giving a paper</em></p>
<span id='81'>That it might please you to give quiet pass</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Through your dominions for this enterprise,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>On such regards of safety and allowance</span><br/>
<span id='84'>As therein are set down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>It likes us well;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And at our more consider'd time well read,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Answer, and think upon this business.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Most welcome home!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>                  This business is well ended.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>My liege, and madam, to expostulate</span><br/>
<span id='93'>What majesty should be, what duty is,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Why day is day, night night, and time is time,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>I will be brief: your noble son is mad:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>What is't but to be nothing else but mad?</span><br/>
<span id='101'>But let that go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>                  More matter, with less art.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Madam, I swear I use no art at all.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>But farewell it, for I will use no art.</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains</span><br/>
<span id='108'>That we find out the cause of this effect,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Or rather say, the cause of this defect,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>For this effect defective comes by cause:</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>I have a daughter&mdash;have while she is mine&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='115'>'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most</span><br/>
<span id='116'>beautified Ophelia,'&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is</span><br/>
<span id='118'>a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='119'>'In her excellent white bosom, these,  &amp;c.'</span><br/>

<span id='speech22'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>

<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='122'>'Doubt thou the stars are fire;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Doubt that the sun doth move;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Doubt truth to be a liar;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>But never doubt I love.</span><br/>
<span id='126'>'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;</span><br/>
<span id='127'>I have not art to reckon my groans: but that</span><br/>
<span id='128'>I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst</span><br/>

<span id='131'>This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>And more above, hath his solicitings,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>As they fell out by time, by means and place,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>All given to mine ear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>

<span id='135'>But how hath she</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Received his love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>                  What do you think of me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>As of a man faithful and honourable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>I would fain prove so. But what might you think,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>When I had seen this hot love on the wing&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>As I perceived it, I must tell you that,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Before my daughter told me&mdash;what might you,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>If I had play'd the desk or table-book,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;</span><br/>
<span id='147'>What might you think? No, I went round to work,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:</span><br/>
<span id='149'>'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;</span><br/>
<span id='150'>This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>That she should lock herself from his resort,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;</span><br/>
<span id='154'>And he, repulsed&mdash;a short tale to make&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Into the madness wherein now he raves,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And all we mourn for.</span><br/>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Do you think 'tis this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>It may be, very likely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Hath there been such a time&mdash;I'd fain know that&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='163'>That I have positively said 'Tis so,'</span><br/>
<span id='164'>When it proved otherwise?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Not that I know.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>[Pointing to his head and shoulder]</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Take this from this, if this be otherwise:</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='171'>                  How may we try it further?</span><br/>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>

<span id='speech45'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>                  So he does indeed.</span><br/>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Be you and I behind an arras then;</span><br/>

<span id='178'>And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Let me be no assistant for a state,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>But keep a farm and carters.</span><br/>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>

<span id='184'>I'll board him presently.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants</em></p>
<p><em>Enter HAMLET, reading</em></p>
<span id='185'>O, give me leave:</span><br/>
<span id='186'>How does my good Lord Hamlet?</span><br/>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Well, God-a-mercy.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Do you know me, my lord?</span><br/>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.</span><br/>

<span id='190'>Not I, my lord.</span><br/>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>

<span id='192'>Honest, my lord!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be</span><br/>
<span id='194'>one man picked out of ten thousand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>That's very true, my lord.</span><br/>

<span id='205'>truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for</span><br/>

<span id='215'>plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of</span><br/>
<span id='216'>wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='217'>though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet</span><br/>
<span id='218'>I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for</span><br/>

<span id='498'>And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall</span><br/>
<span id='499'>On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne</span><br/>
<span id='500'>With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword</span><br/>
<span id='501'>Now falls on Priam.</span><br/>
<span id='502'>Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,</span><br/>
<span id='503'>In general synod 'take away her power;</span><br/>
<span id='504'>Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,</span><br/>
<span id='505'>And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,</span><br/>

<p><em>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</em></p>
<span id='558'>Now I am alone.</span><br/>
<span id='559'>O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!</span><br/>
<span id='560'>Is it not monstrous that this player here,</span><br/>
<span id='561'>But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,</span><br/>
<span id='562'>Could force his soul so to his own conceit</span><br/>
<span id='563'>That from her working all his visage wann'd,</span><br/>
<span id='564'>Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,</span><br/>
<span id='565'>A broken voice, and his whole function suiting</span><br/>
<span id='566'>With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!</span><br/>
<span id='567'>For Hecuba!</span><br/>
<span id='568'>What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,</span><br/>
<span id='569'>That he should weep for her? What would he do,</span><br/>
<span id='570'>Had he the motive and the cue for passion</span><br/>
<span id='571'>That I have? He would drown the stage with tears</span><br/>
<span id='572'>And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,</span><br/>
<span id='573'>Make mad the guilty and appal the free,</span><br/>
<span id='574'>Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed</span><br/>
<span id='575'>The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,</span><br/>
<span id='576'>A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,</span><br/>
<span id='577'>Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,</span><br/>
<span id='578'>And can say nothing; no, not for a king,</span><br/>
<span id='579'>Upon whose property and most dear life</span><br/>
<span id='580'>A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?</span><br/>
<span id='581'>Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?</span><br/>
<span id='582'>Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?</span><br/>
<span id='583'>Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,</span><br/>
<span id='584'>As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?</span><br/>
<span id='585'>Ha!</span><br/>
<span id='586'>'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be</span><br/>
<span id='587'>But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall</span><br/>
<span id='588'>To make oppression bitter, or ere this</span><br/>
<span id='589'>I should have fatted all the region kites</span><br/>

<span id='592'>O, vengeance!</span><br/>
<span id='593'>Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,</span><br/>
<span id='594'>That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,</span><br/>
<span id='595'>Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,</span><br/>
<span id='596'>Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,</span><br/>
<span id='597'>And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,</span><br/>
<span id='598'>A scullion!</span><br/>
<span id='599'>Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard</span><br/>
<span id='600'>That guilty creatures sitting at a play</span><br/>
<span id='601'>Have by the very cunning of the scene</span><br/>
<span id='602'>Been struck so to the soul that presently</span><br/>
<span id='603'>They have proclaim'd their malefactions;</span><br/>
<span id='604'>For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak</span><br/>
<span id='605'>With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players</span><br/>
<span id='606'>Play something like the murder of my father</span><br/>
<span id='607'>Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;</span><br/>
<span id='608'>I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,</span><br/>
<span id='609'>I know my course. The spirit that I have seen</span><br/>
<span id='610'>May be the devil: and the devil hath power</span><br/>
<span id='611'>To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps</span><br/>
<span id='612'>Out of my weakness and my melancholy,</span><br/>
<span id='613'>As he is very potent with such spirits,</span><br/>
<span id='614'>Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds</span><br/>
<span id='615'>More relative than this: the play's the thing</span><br/>
<span id='616'>Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.</span><br/>

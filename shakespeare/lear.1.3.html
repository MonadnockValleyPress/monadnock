<h1>King Lear</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The Duke of Albany's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GONERIL, and OSWALD, her steward</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Yes, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>By day and night he wrongs me; every hour</span><br/>
<span id='4'>He flashes into one gross crime or other,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us</span><br/>
<span id='7'>On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>I will not speak with him; say I am sick:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>If you come slack of former services,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>He's coming, madam; I hear him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Horns within</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Put on what weary negligence you please,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>You and your fellows; I'll have it come to question:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>If he dislike it, let him to our sister,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>That still would manage those authorities</span><br/>
<span id='18'>That he hath given away! Now, by my life,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Old fools are babes again; and must be used</span><br/>
<span id='20'>With cheques as flatteries,&mdash;when they are seen abused.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Remember what I tell you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Well, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>And let his knights have colder looks among you;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

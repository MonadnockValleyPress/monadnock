<h1>Richard II</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</H3>
<h4>The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter QUEEN, BUSHY, and BAGOT</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BUSHY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Madam, your majesty is too much sad:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>You promised, when you parted with the king,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>To lay aside life-harming heaviness</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And entertain a cheerful disposition.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>To please the king I did; to please myself</span><br/>
<span id='6'>I cannot do it; yet I know no cause</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest</span><br/>
<span id='9'>As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Is coming towards me, and my inward soul</span><br/>
<span id='12'>With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>More than with parting from my lord the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>BUSHY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Divides one thing entire to many objects;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Looking awry upon your lord's departure,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Which for things true weeps things imaginary.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>It may be so; but yet my inward soul</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad</span><br/>
<span id='31'>As, though on thinking on no thought I think,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BUSHY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived</span><br/>
<span id='35'>From some forefather grief; mine is not so,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>For nothing had begot my something grief;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>'Tis in reversion that I do possess;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>But what it is, that is not yet known; what</span><br/>
<span id='40'>I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GREEN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GREEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GREEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>That he, our hope, might have retired his power,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And driven into despair an enemy's hope,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Who strongly hath set footing in this land:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And with uplifted arms is safe arrived</span><br/>
<span id='51'>At Ravenspurgh.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>                  Now God in heaven forbid!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GREEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BUSHY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And all the rest revolted faction traitors?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>GREEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And all the household servants fled with him</span><br/>
<span id='62'>To Bolingbroke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BUSHY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Despair not, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Who shall hinder me?</span><br/>
<span id='70'>I will despair, and be at enmity</span><br/>
<span id='71'>With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>A parasite, a keeper back of death,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Which false hope lingers in extremity.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DUKE OF YORK</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>GREEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Here comes the Duke of York.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>QUEEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>With signs of war about his aged neck:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>O, full of careful business are his looks!</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Your husband, he is gone to save far off,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Whilst others come to make him lose at home:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Here am I left to underprop his land,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Servant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>My lord, your son was gone before I came.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!</span><br/>
<span id='90'>The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Hold, take my ring.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>To-day, as I came by, I called there;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>But I shall grieve you to report the rest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>What is't, knave?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Servant</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>An hour before I came, the duchess died.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>God for his mercy! what a tide of woes</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!</span><br/>
<span id='102'>I know not what to do: I would to God,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>So my untruth had not provoked him to it,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>The king had cut off my head with my brother's.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?</span><br/>
<span id='106'>How shall we do for money for these wars?</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Come, sister,&mdash;cousin, I would say&mdash;pray, pardon me.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And bring away the armour that is there.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Servant</em></p>
<span id='110'>Gentlemen, will you go muster men?</span><br/>
<span id='111'>If I know how or which way to order these affairs</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And duty bids defend; the other again</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Dispose of you.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>And meet me presently at Berkeley.</span><br/>
<span id='122'>I should to Plashy too;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>But time will not permit: all is uneven,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And every thing is left at six and seven.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt DUKE OF YORK and QUEEN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BUSHY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>But none returns. For us to levy power</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Proportionable to the enemy</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Is all unpossible.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>GREEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Besides, our nearness to the king in love</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Is near the hate of those love not the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BAGOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>And that's the wavering commons: for their love</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them</span><br/>
<span id='133'>By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>BUSHY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>BAGOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>If judgement lie in them, then so do we,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Because we ever have been near the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>GREEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>BUSHY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Thither will I with you; for little office</span><br/>
<span id='140'>The hateful commons will perform for us,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Will you go along with us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>BAGOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>BUSHY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>GREEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>BUSHY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Well, we may meet again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>BAGOT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>I fear me, never.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Capulet's orchard.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter JULIET</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner</span><br/>
<span id='3'>As Phaethon would whip you to the west,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And bring in cloudy night immediately.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Lovers can see to do their amorous rites</span><br/>
<span id='9'>By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And learn me how to lose a winning match,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Think true love acted simple modesty.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Take him and cut him out in little stars,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And he will make the face of heaven so fine</span><br/>
<span id='24'>That all the world will be in love with night</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And pay no worship to the garish sun.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>O, I have bought the mansion of a love,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day</span><br/>
<span id='29'>As is the night before some festival</span><br/>
<span id='30'>To an impatient child that hath new robes</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks</span><br/>
<span id='33'>But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Nurse, with cords</em></p>
<span id='34'>Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords</span><br/>
<span id='35'>That Romeo bid thee fetch?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Ay, ay, the cords.</span><br/>
<p><em>Throws them down</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!</span><br/>
<span id='39'>We are undone, lady, we are undone!</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Can heaven be so envious?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Romeo can,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?</span><br/>
<span id='46'>This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:</span><br/>
<span id='50'>I am not I, if there be such an I;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'</span><br/>
<span id='52'>If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>God save the mark!&mdash;here on his manly breast:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!</span><br/>
<span id='60'>To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!</span><br/>
<span id='64'>O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!</span><br/>
<span id='65'>That ever I should live to see thee dead!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>What storm is this that blows so contrary?</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?</span><br/>
<span id='68'>My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!</span><br/>
<span id='70'>For who is living, if those two are gone?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>It did, it did; alas the day, it did!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Despised substance of divinest show!</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>A damned saint, an honourable villain!</span><br/>
<span id='82'>O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend</span><br/>
<span id='84'>In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Was ever book containing such vile matter</span><br/>
<span id='86'>So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell</span><br/>
<span id='87'>In such a gorgeous palace!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>There's no trust,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Shame come to Romeo!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Blister'd be thy tongue</span><br/>
<span id='95'>For such a wish! he was not born to shame:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Sole monarch of the universal earth.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>O, what a beast was I to chide at him!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?</span><br/>
<span id='104'>But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?</span><br/>
<span id='105'>That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Your tributary drops belong to woe,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.</span><br/>
<span id='109'>My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:</span><br/>
<span id='111'>All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>But, O, it presses to my memory,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:</span><br/>
<span id='116'>'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo&mdash;banished;'</span><br/>
<span id='117'>That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Was woe enough, if it had ended there:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship</span><br/>
<span id='121'>And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Which modern lamentations might have moved?</span><br/>
<span id='125'>But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'</span><br/>
<span id='129'>There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>He made you for a highway to my bed;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Nurse</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo</span><br/>
<span id='143'>To comfort you: I wot well where he is.</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:</span><br/>
<span id='145'>I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>JULIET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>And bid him come to take his last farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

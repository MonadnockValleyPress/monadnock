<h1>Titus Andronicus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene III</h3>
<h4>A lonely part of the forest.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter AARON, with a bag of gold</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>He that had wit would think that I had none,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>To bury so much gold under a tree,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And never after to inherit it.</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Let him that thinks of me so abjectly</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Which, cunningly effected, will beget</span><br/>
<span id='7'>A very excellent piece of villany:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest</span><br/>
<p><em>Hides the gold</em></p>
<span id='9'>That have their alms out of the empress' chest.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter TAMORA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The birds chant melody on every bush,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>As if a double hunt were heard at once,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And, after conflict such as was supposed</span><br/>
<span id='22'>The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>When with a happy storm they were surprised</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Be unto us as is a nurse's song</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Madam, though Venus govern your desires,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Saturn is dominator over mine:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>What signifies my deadly-standing eye,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>My silence and my cloudy melancholy,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Even as an adder when she doth unroll</span><br/>
<span id='36'>To do some fatal execution?</span><br/>
<span id='37'>No, madam, these are no venereal signs:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>This is the day of doom for Bassianus:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Thy sons make pillage of her chastity</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Now question me no more; we are espied;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>AARON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>No more, great empress; Bassianus comes:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Be cross with him; and I'll go fetch thy sons</span><br/>
<span id='54'>To back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter BASSIANUS and LAVINIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BASSIANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Or is it Dian, habited like her,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Who hath abandoned her holy groves</span><br/>
<span id='59'>To see the general hunting in this forest?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Saucy controller of our private steps!</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Had I the power that some say Dian had,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Thy temples should be planted presently</span><br/>
<span id='63'>With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Unmannerly intruder as thou art!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LAVINIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Under your patience, gentle empress,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And to be doubted that your Moor and you</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Are singled forth to try experiments:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!</span><br/>
<span id='71'>'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BASSIANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Doth make your honour of his body's hue,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Spotted, detested, and abominable.</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Why are you sequester'd from all your train,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And wander'd hither to an obscure plot,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>If foul desire had not conducted you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LAVINIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>And, being intercepted in your sport,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Great reason that my noble lord be rated</span><br/>
<span id='82'>For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And let her joy her raven-colour'd love;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>This valley fits the purpose passing well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BASSIANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>The king my brother shall have note of this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LAVINIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Ay, for these slips have made him noted long:</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Good king, to be so mightily abused!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Why have I patience to endure all this?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?</span><br/>
<span id='92'>These two have 'ticed me hither to this place:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>A barren detested vale, you see it is;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>They told me, here, at dead time of the night,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Would make such fearful and confused cries</span><br/>
<span id='103'>As any mortal body hearing it</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>No sooner had they told this hellish tale,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>But straight they told me they would bind me here</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Unto the body of a dismal yew,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And leave me to this miserable death:</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And then they call'd me foul adulteress,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms</span><br/>
<span id='111'>That ever ear did hear to such effect:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>This vengeance on me had they executed.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>This is a witness that I am thy son.</span><br/>
<p><em>Stabs BASSIANUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>And this for me, struck home to show my strength.</span><br/>
<p><em>Also stabs BASSIANUS, who dies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LAVINIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>For no name fits thy nature but thy own!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Give me thy poniard; you shall know, my boys</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:</span><br/>
<span id='124'>This minion stood upon her chastity,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:</span><br/>
<span id='127'>And shall she carry this unto her grave?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>But when ye have the honey ye desire,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>I warrant you, madam, we wil l make that sure.</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy</span><br/>
<span id='135'>That nice-preserved honesty of yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LAVINIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>I will not hear her speak; away with her!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LAVINIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory</span><br/>
<span id='140'>To see her tears; but be your heart to them</span><br/>
<span id='141'>As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LAVINIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?</span><br/>
<span id='143'>O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;</span><br/>
<span id='144'>The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble;</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:</span><br/>
<p><em>To CHIRON</em></p>
<span id='147'>Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LAVINIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>'Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark:</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Yet have I heard,&mdash;O, could I find it now!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='151'>The lion moved with pity did endure</span><br/>
<span id='152'>To have his princely paws pared all away:</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:</span><br/>
<span id='155'>O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>I know not what it means; away with her!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LAVINIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>That gave thee life, when well he might have</span><br/>
<span id='160'>slain thee,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Even for his sake am I pitiless.</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>To save your brother from the sacrifice;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>But fierce Andronicus would not relent;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>The worse to her, the better loved of me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LAVINIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>And with thine own hands kill me in this place!</span><br/>
<span id='171'>For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>What begg'st thou, then? fond woman, let me go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LAVINIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>'Tis present death I beg; and one thing more</span><br/>
<span id='175'>That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:</span><br/>
<span id='176'>O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>And tumble me into some loathsome pit,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Where never man's eye may behold my body:</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Do this, and be a charitable murderer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>TAMORA</strong></span>

<span id='180'>So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee:</span><br/>
<span id='181'>No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.</span><br/>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LAVINIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature!</span><br/>
<span id='184'>The blot and enemy to our general name!</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Confusion fall&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband:</span><br/>
<span id='187'>This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.</span><br/>
<p><em>DEMETRIUS throws the body of BASSIANUS into the  pit; then exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, dragging off LAVINIA</em></p>

<span id='188'>Farewell, my sons: see that you make her sure.</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Till all the Andronici be made away.</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>And let my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r.</span><br/>

<span id='speech45'><strong>QUINTUS</strong></span>

<span id='199'>What art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood</span><br/>
<span id='202'>As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers?</span><br/>
<span id='203'>A very fatal place it seems to me.</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?</span><br/>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MARTIUS</strong></span>

<span id='212'>I am surprised with an uncouth fear;</span><br/>

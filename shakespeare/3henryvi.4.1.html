<h1>Henry VI, Part 3</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>London. The palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, SOMERSET, and MONTAGUE</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>How could he stay till Warwick made return?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>And his well-chosen bride.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>I mind to tell him plainly what I think.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, attended; QUEEN ELIZABETH, PEMBROKE, STAFFORD, HASTINGS, and others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Which are so weak of courage and in judgment</span><br/>
<span id='13'>That they'll take no offence at our abuse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Suppose they take offence without a cause,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>And shall have your will, because our king:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Not I:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To sunder them that yoke so well together.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Should not become my wife and England's queen.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And you too, Somerset and Montague,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Speak freely what you think.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Becomes your enemy, for mocking him</span><br/>
<span id='31'>About the marriage of the Lady Bona.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased</span><br/>
<span id='35'>By such invention as I can devise?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth</span><br/>
<span id='38'>'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Why, knows not Montague that of itself</span><br/>
<span id='40'>England is safe, if true within itself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>'Tis better using France than trusting France:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Let us be back'd with God and with the seas</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Which He hath given for fence impregnable,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And with their helps only defend ourselves;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>In them and in ourselves our safety lies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves</span><br/>
<span id='48'>To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And for this once my will shall stand for law.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Unto the brother of your loving bride;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>She better would have fitted me or Clarence:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>But in your bride you bury brotherhood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife</span><br/>
<span id='60'>That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Which being shallow, you give me leave</span><br/>
<span id='63'>To play the broker in mine own behalf;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And not be tied unto his brother's will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>My lords, before it pleased his majesty</span><br/>
<span id='68'>To raise my state to title of a queen,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Do me but right, and you must all confess</span><br/>
<span id='70'>That I was not ignoble of descent;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And meaner than myself have had like fortune.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>But as this title honours me and mine,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>So long as Edward is thy constant friend,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>[Aside]  I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Post</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Now, messenger, what letters or what news</span><br/>
<span id='85'>From France?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Post</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>But such as I, without your special pardon,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Dare not relate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Post</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>At my depart, these were his very words:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>That Lewis of France is sending over masquers</span><br/>
<span id='95'>To revel it with him and his new bride.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.</span><br/>
<span id='97'>But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>Post</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>I blame not her, she could say little less;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?</span><br/>
<span id='103'>For I have heard that she was there in place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Post</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And I am ready to put armour on.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Belike she minds to play the Amazon.</span><br/>
<span id='107'>But what said Warwick to these injuries?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Post</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>He, more incensed against your majesty</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.</span><br/>
<span id='115'>But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Post</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in</span><br/>
<span id='117'>friendship</span><br/>
<span id='118'>That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage</span><br/>
<span id='123'>I may not prove inferior to yourself.</span><br/>
<span id='124'>You that love me and Warwick, follow me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit CLARENCE, and SOMERSET follows</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>[Aside]  Not I:</span><br/>
<span id='126'>My thoughts aim at a further matter; I</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Stay not for the love of Edward, but the crown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And haste is needful in this desperate case.</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Go levy men, and make prepare for war;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>They are already, or quickly will be landed:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Myself in person will straight follow you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD</em></p>
<span id='135'>But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?</span><br/>
<span id='139'>If it be so, then both depart to him;</span><br/>
<span id='140'>I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:</span><br/>
<span id='141'>But if you mind to hold your true obedience,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Give me assurance with some friendly vow,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>That I may never have you in suspect.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>So God help Montague as he proves true!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Why, so! then am I sure of victory.</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

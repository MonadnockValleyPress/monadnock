<h1>Love's Labours Lost</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>The king of Navarre's park.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Live register'd upon our brazen tombs</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And then grace us in the disgrace of death;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>The endeavor of this present breath may buy</span><br/>
<span id='6'>That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And make us heirs of all eternity.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Therefore, brave conquerors,&mdash;for so you are,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>That war against your own affections</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And the huge army of the world's desires,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Our court shall be a little Academe,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Still and contemplative in living art.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Have sworn for three years' term to live with me</span><br/>
<span id='17'>My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes</span><br/>
<span id='18'>That are recorded in this schedule here:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>That his own hand may strike his honour down</span><br/>
<span id='21'>That violates the smallest branch herein:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LONGAVILLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DUMAIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>The grosser manner of these world's delights</span><br/>
<span id='30'>He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>With all these living in philosophy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>I can but say their protestation over;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>That is, to live and study here three years.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>But there are other strict observances;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>As, not to see a woman in that term,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Which I hope well is not enrolled there;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And one day in a week to touch no food</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And but one meal on every day beside,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>The which I hope is not enrolled there;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And not be seen to wink of all the day&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>When I was wont to think no harm all night</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And make a dark night too of half the day&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Which I hope well is not enrolled there:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>I only swore to study with your grace</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And stay here in your court for three years' space.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LONGAVILLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>What is the end of study? let me know.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Why, that to know, which else we should not know.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Come on, then; I will swear to study so,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>To know the thing I am forbid to know:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>As thus,&mdash;to study where I well may dine,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>When I to feast expressly am forbid;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Or study where to meet some mistress fine,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>When mistresses from common sense are hid;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Study to break it and not break my troth.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>If study's gain be thus and this be so,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Study knows that which yet it doth not know:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>These be the stops that hinder study quite</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And train our intellects to vain delight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>As, painfully to pore upon a book</span><br/>
<span id='75'>To seek the light of truth; while truth the while</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Study me how to please the eye indeed</span><br/>
<span id='81'>By fixing it upon a fairer eye,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And give him light that it was blinded by.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Study is like the heaven's glorious sun</span><br/>
<span id='85'>That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Small have continual plodders ever won</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Save base authority from others' books.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights</span><br/>
<span id='89'>That give a name to every fixed star</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Have no more profit of their shining nights</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Than those that walk and wot not what they are.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Too much to know is to know nought but fame;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And every godfather can give a name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>How well he's read, to reason against reading!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DUMAIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LONGAVILLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DUMAIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>How follows that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>                  Fit in his place and time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DUMAIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>In reason nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>                  Something then in rhyme.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>That bites the first-born infants of the spring.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Before the birds have any cause to sing?</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Why should I joy in any abortive birth?</span><br/>
<span id='107'>At Christmas I no more desire a rose</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>But like of each thing that in season grows.</span><br/>
<span id='110'>So you, to study now it is too late,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And though I have for barbarism spoke more</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Than for that angel knowledge you can say,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And bide the penance of each three years' day.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Give me the paper; let me read the same;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>[Reads]  'Item, That no woman shall come within a</span><br/>
<span id='122'>mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>LONGAVILLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Four days ago.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Let's see the penalty.</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='125'>'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LONGAVILLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Marry, that did I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Sweet lord, and why?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LONGAVILLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>To fright them hence with that dread penalty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>A dangerous law against gentility!</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='130'>'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman</span><br/>
<span id='131'>within the term of three years, he shall endure such</span><br/>
<span id='132'>public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'</span><br/>
<span id='133'>This article, my liege, yourself must break;</span><br/>
<span id='134'>For well you know here comes in embassy</span><br/>
<span id='135'>The French king's daughter with yourself to speak&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='136'>A maid of grace and complete majesty&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='137'>About surrender up of Aquitaine</span><br/>
<span id='138'>To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Therefore this article is made in vain,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>So study evermore is overshot:</span><br/>
<span id='143'>While it doth study to have what it would</span><br/>
<span id='144'>It doth forget to do the thing it should,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>We must of force dispense with this decree;</span><br/>
<span id='148'>She must lie here on mere necessity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Necessity will make us all forsworn</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Three thousand times within this three years' space;</span><br/>
<span id='151'>For every man with his affects is born,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Not by might master'd but by special grace:</span><br/>
<span id='153'>If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;</span><br/>
<span id='154'>I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'</span><br/>
<span id='155'>So to the laws at large I write my name:</span><br/>
<p><em>Subscribes</em></p>
<span id='156'>And he that breaks them in the least degree</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Stands in attainder of eternal shame:</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Suggestions are to other as to me;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>But I believe, although I seem so loath,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>I am the last that will last keep his oath.</span><br/>
<span id='161'>But is there no quick recreation granted?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted</span><br/>
<span id='163'>With a refined traveller of Spain;</span><br/>
<span id='164'>A man in all the world's new fashion planted,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>One whom the music of his own vain tongue</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;</span><br/>
<span id='168'>A man of complements, whom right and wrong</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:</span><br/>
<span id='170'>This child of fancy, that Armado hight,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>For interim to our studies shall relate</span><br/>
<span id='172'>In high-born words the worth of many a knight</span><br/>
<span id='173'>From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.</span><br/>
<span id='174'>How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;</span><br/>
<span id='175'>But, I protest, I love to hear him lie</span><br/>
<span id='176'>And I will use him for my minstrelsy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>Armado is a most illustrious wight,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.</span><br/>

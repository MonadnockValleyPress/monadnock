<h1>Henry VI, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>The coast of Kent.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Alarum. Fight at sea. Ordnance goes off. Enter a  Captain, a Master, a Master's-mate, WALTER WHITMORE, and others; with them SUFFOLK, and others, prisoners</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>The gaudy, blabbing and remorseful day</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Is crept into the bosom of the sea;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades</span><br/>
<span id='4'>That drag the tragic melancholy night;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Who, with their drowsy, slow and flagging wings,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Master, this prisoner freely give I thee;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And thou that art his mate, make boot of this;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>What is my ransom, master? let me know.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>Master</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Master's-Mate	And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And bear the name and port of gentlemen?</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Cut both the villains' throats; for die you shall:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>The lives of those which we have lost in fight</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>I'll give it, sir; and therefore spare my life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>And so will I and write home for it straight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>WHITMORE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And therefore to revenge it, shalt thou die;</span><br/>
<p><em>To SUFFOLK</em></p>
<span id='27'>And so should these, if I might have my will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Look on my George; I am a gentleman:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>WHITMORE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>How now! why start'st thou? what, doth</span><br/>
<span id='33'>death affright?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>A cunning man did calculate my birth</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And told me that by water I should die:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Thy name is Gaultier, being rightly sounded.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>WHITMORE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Gaultier or Walter, which it is, I care not:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Never yet did base dishonour blur our name,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>But with our sword we wiped away the blot;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Stay, Whitmore; for thy prisoner is a prince,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>WHITMORE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The honourable blood of Lancaster,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And thought thee happy when I shook my head?</span><br/>
<span id='57'>How often hast thou waited at my cup,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And duly waited for my coming forth?</span><br/>
<span id='64'>This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>WHITMORE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>First let my words stab him, as he hath me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Convey him hence and on our longboat's side</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Strike off his head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Thou darest not, for thy own.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Yes, Pole.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>       Pole!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>         Pool! Sir Pool! lord!</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Ay, kennel, puddle, sink; whose filth and dirt</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth</span><br/>
<span id='78'>For swallowing the treasure of the realm:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>For daring to affy a mighty lord</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Unto the daughter of a worthless king,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.</span><br/>
<span id='87'>By devilish policy art thou grown great,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorged</span><br/>
<span id='89'>With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>The false revolting Normans thorough thee</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>As hating thee, are rising up in arms:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And now the house of York, thrust from the crown</span><br/>
<span id='99'>By shameful murder of a guiltless king</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And lofty proud encroaching tyranny,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Burns with revenging fire; whose hopeful colours</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Advance our half-faced sun, striving to shine,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Under the which is writ 'Invitis nubibus.'</span><br/>
<span id='104'>The commons here in Kent are up in arms:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And, to conclude, reproach and beggary</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Is crept into the palace of our king.</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Small things make base men proud: this villain here,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>It is impossible that I should die</span><br/>
<span id='115'>By such a lowly vassal as thyself.</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Thy words move rage and not remorse in me:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>I go of message from the queen to France;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Walter,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>WHITMORE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>WHITMORE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.</span><br/>
<span id='123'>What, are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Used to command, untaught to plead for favour.</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Far be it we should honour such as these</span><br/>
<span id='128'>With humble suit: no, rather let my head</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Save to the God of heaven and to my king;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And sooner dance upon a bloody pole</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.</span><br/>
<span id='133'>True nobility is exempt from fear:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>More can I bear than you dare execute.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Hale him away, and let him talk no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>That this my death may never be forgot!</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Great men oft die by vile bezonians:</span><br/>
<span id='139'>A Roman sworder and banditto slave</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Stabb'd Julius Caesar; savage islanders</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Whitmore and others with Suffolk</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>Captain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>And as for these whose ransom we have set,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>It is our pleasure one of them depart;</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Therefore come you with us and let him go.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but the First Gentleman</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter WHITMORE with SUFFOLK's body</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>WHITMORE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>There let his head and lifeless body lie,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Until the queen his mistress bury it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>O barbarous and bloody spectacle!</span><br/>
<span id='149'>His body will I bear unto the king:</span><br/>
<span id='150'>If he revenge it not, yet will his friends;</span><br/>
<span id='151'>So will the queen, that living held him dear.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit with the body</em></p>

<h1>Henry VI, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Gloucester's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GLOUCESTER and his DUCHESS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>As frowning at the favours of the world?</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?</span><br/>
<span id='7'>What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Enchased with all the honours of the world?</span><br/>
<span id='9'>If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Until thy head be circled with the same.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>What, is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And, having both together heaved it up,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>We'll both together lift our heads to heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And never more abase our sight so low</span><br/>
<span id='16'>As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And may that thought, when I imagine ill</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Be my last breathing in this mortal world!</span><br/>
<span id='22'>My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>What dream'd my lord? tell me, and I'll requite it</span><br/>
<span id='24'>With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>But, as I think, it was by the cardinal;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And on the pieces of the broken wand</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And William de la Pole, first duke of Suffolk.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Tut, this was nothing but an argument</span><br/>
<span id='33'>That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Shall lose his head for his presumption.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Methought I sat in seat of majesty</span><br/>
<span id='37'>In the cathedral church of Westminster,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel'd to me</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And on my head did set the diadem.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtured Eleanor,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Art thou not second woman in the realm,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And the protector's wife, beloved of him?</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Above the reach or compass of thy thought?</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>To tumble down thy husband and thyself</span><br/>
<span id='49'>From top of honour to disgrace's feet?</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Away from me, and let me hear no more!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>What, what, my lord! are you so choleric</span><br/>
<span id='52'>With Eleanor, for telling but her dream?</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And not be cheque'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Nay, be not angry; I am pleased again.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>My lord protector, 'tis his highness' pleasure</span><br/>
<span id='57'>You do prepare to ride unto Saint Alban's,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Where as the king and queen do mean to hawk.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Messenger</em></p>
<span id='61'>Follow I must; I cannot go before,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And smooth my way upon their headless necks;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And, being a woman, I will not be slack</span><br/>
<span id='67'>To play my part in Fortune's pageant.</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Where are you there? Sir John! nay, fear not, man,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>We are alone; here's none but thee and I.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HUME</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>HUME</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Jesus preserve your royal majesty!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>What say'st thou? majesty! I am but grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HUME</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>But, by the grace of God, and Hume's advice,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Your grace's title shall be multiplied.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>What say'st thou, man? hast thou as yet conferr'd</span><br/>
<span id='75'>With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer?</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And will they undertake to do me good?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HUME</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>This they have promised, to show your highness</span><br/>
<span id='79'>A spirit raised from depth of under-ground,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>That shall make answer to such questions</span><br/>
<span id='81'>As by your grace shall be propounded him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>It is enough; I'll think upon the questions:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>When from St. Alban's we do make return,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>We'll see these things effected to the full.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Here, Hume, take this reward; make merry, man,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>With thy confederates in this weighty cause.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>HUME</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Marry, and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume!</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>The business asketh silent secrecy.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Yet have I gold flies from another coast;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>I dare not say, from the rich cardinal</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Yet I do find it so; for to be plain,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Have hired me to undermine the duchess</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And buz these conjurations in her brain.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker;'</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near</span><br/>
<span id='103'>To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Well, so it stands; and thus, I fear, at last</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wreck,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

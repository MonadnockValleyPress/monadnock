<h1>As You Like It</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The forest.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ORLANDO, with a paper</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey</span><br/>
<span id='3'>With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And in their barks my thoughts I'll character;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>That every eye which in this forest looks</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree</span><br/>
<span id='10'>The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CORIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good</span><br/>
<span id='13'>life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I</span><br/>
<span id='15'>like it very well; but in respect that it is</span><br/>
<span id='16'>private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it</span><br/>
<span id='17'>is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in</span><br/>
<span id='18'>respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As</span><br/>
<span id='19'>is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much</span><br/>
<span id='21'>against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CORIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>No more but that I know the more one sickens the</span><br/>
<span id='23'>worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>means and content is without three good friends;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>that the property of rain is to wet and fire to</span><br/>
<span id='26'>burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a</span><br/>
<span id='27'>great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that</span><br/>
<span id='28'>he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may</span><br/>
<span id='29'>complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in</span><br/>
<span id='31'>court, shepherd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CORIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>No, truly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Then thou art damned.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CORIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Nay, I hope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all</span><br/>
<span id='36'>on one side.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CORIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>For not being at court? Your reason.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest</span><br/>
<span id='39'>good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is</span><br/>
<span id='41'>sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous</span><br/>
<span id='42'>state, shepherd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CORIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners</span><br/>
<span id='44'>at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the</span><br/>
<span id='45'>behavior of the country is most mockable at the</span><br/>
<span id='46'>court. You told me you salute not at the court, but</span><br/>
<span id='47'>you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be</span><br/>
<span id='48'>uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Instance, briefly; come, instance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CORIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their</span><br/>
<span id='51'>fells, you know, are greasy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not</span><br/>
<span id='53'>the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of</span><br/>
<span id='54'>a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CORIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Besides, our hands are hard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>A more sounder instance, come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CORIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>And they are often tarred over with the surgery of</span><br/>
<span id='59'>our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The</span><br/>
<span id='60'>courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a</span><br/>
<span id='62'>good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and</span><br/>
<span id='63'>perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the</span><br/>
<span id='64'>very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CORIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!</span><br/>
<span id='67'>God make incision in thee! thou art raw.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CORIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get</span><br/>
<span id='69'>that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's</span><br/>
<span id='70'>happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my</span><br/>
<span id='71'>harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes</span><br/>
<span id='72'>graze and my lambs suck.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes</span><br/>
<span id='74'>and the rams together and to offer to get your</span><br/>
<span id='75'>living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a</span><br/>
<span id='76'>bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a</span><br/>
<span id='77'>twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not</span><br/>
<span id='79'>damned for this, the devil himself will have no</span><br/>
<span id='80'>shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst</span><br/>
<span id='81'>'scape.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CORIN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ROSALIND, with a paper, reading</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>     From the east to western Ind,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>No jewel is like Rosalind.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Her worth, being mounted on the wind,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Through all the world bears Rosalind.</span><br/>
<span id='87'>All the pictures fairest lined</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Are but black to Rosalind.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Let no fair be kept in mind</span><br/>
<span id='90'>But the fair of Rosalind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and</span><br/>
<span id='92'>suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the</span><br/>
<span id='93'>right butter-women's rank to market.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Out, fool!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>For a taste:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>If a hart do lack a hind,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Let him seek out Rosalind.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>If the cat will after kind,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>So be sure will Rosalind.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Winter garments must be lined,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>So must slender Rosalind.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>They that reap must sheaf and bind;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Then to cart with Rosalind.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Such a nut is Rosalind.</span><br/>
<span id='106'>He that sweetest rose will find</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Must find love's prick and Rosalind.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you</span><br/>
<span id='109'>infect yourself with them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it</span><br/>
<span id='113'>with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit</span><br/>
<span id='114'>i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half</span><br/>
<span id='115'>ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>TOUCHSTONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the</span><br/>
<span id='117'>forest judge.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CELIA, with a writing</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<span id='119'>[Reads]</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Why should this a desert be?</span><br/>
<span id='121'>For it is unpeopled? No:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Tongues I'll hang on every tree,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>That shall civil sayings show:</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Some, how brief the life of man</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Runs his erring pilgrimage,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>That the stretching of a span</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Buckles in his sum of age;</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Some, of violated vows</span><br/>
<span id='129'>'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>But upon the fairest boughs,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Or at every sentence end,</span><br/>

<span id='133'>Teaching all that read to know</span><br/>
<span id='134'>The quintessence of every sprite</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Heaven would in little show.</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Therefore Heaven Nature charged</span><br/>
<span id='137'>That one body should be fill'd</span><br/>
<span id='138'>With all graces wide-enlarged:</span><br/>

<span id='142'>Atalanta's better part,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Sad Lucretia's modesty.</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Thus Rosalind of many parts</span><br/>
<span id='145'>By heavenly synod was devised,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Of many faces, eyes and hearts,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>To have the touches dearest prized.</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Heaven would that she these gifts should have,</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear</span><br/>
<span id='162'>themselves without the verse and therefore stood</span><br/>
<span id='163'>lamely in the verse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>

<span id='176'>O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to</span><br/>

<span id='326'>I have been told so of many: but indeed an old</span><br/>

<span id='328'>in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship</span><br/>
<span id='329'>too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard</span><br/>

<span id='331'>I am not a woman, to be touched with so many</span><br/>

<span id='340'>No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that</span><br/>

<span id='342'>abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on</span><br/>
<span id='343'>their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies</span><br/>
<span id='344'>on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of</span><br/>
<span id='345'>Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would</span><br/>

<span id='speech129'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>

<span id='353'>What were his marks?</span><br/>

<span id='357'>which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for</span><br/>
<span id='358'>simply your having in beard is a younger brother's</span><br/>
<span id='359'>revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your</span><br/>
<span id='360'>bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe</span><br/>
<span id='361'>untied and every thing about you demonstrating a</span><br/>
<span id='362'>careless desolation; but you are no such man; you</span><br/>
<span id='363'>are rather point-device in your accoutrements as</span><br/>

<span id='369'>points in the which women still give the lie to</span><br/>
<span id='370'>their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he</span><br/>

<span id='373'>I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of</span><br/>

<span id='377'>Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves</span><br/>
<span id='378'>as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and</span><br/>
<span id='379'>the reason why they are not so punished and cured</span><br/>
<span id='380'>is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers</span><br/>
<span id='381'>are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech137'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>

<span id='382'>Did you ever cure any so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech138'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='383'>Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me</span><br/>
<span id='384'>his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to</span><br/>
<span id='385'>woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish</span><br/>
<span id='386'>youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing</span><br/>
<span id='387'>and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,</span><br/>
<span id='388'>inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every</span><br/>
<span id='389'>passion something and for no passion truly any</span><br/>
<span id='390'>thing, as boys and women are for the most part</span><br/>
<span id='391'>cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe</span><br/>
<span id='392'>him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep</span><br/>
<span id='393'>for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor</span><br/>
<span id='394'>from his mad humour of love to a living humour of</span><br/>
<span id='395'>madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of</span><br/>
<span id='396'>the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.</span><br/>
<span id='397'>And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon</span><br/>
<span id='398'>me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's</span><br/>
<span id='399'>heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.</span><br/>

<span id='speech143'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></a>

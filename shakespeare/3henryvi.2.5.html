<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>This battle fares like to the morning's war,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>When dying clouds contend with growing light,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Can neither call it perfect day nor night.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Forced to retire by fury of the wind:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Now one the better, then another best;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>So is the equal of this fell war.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Here on this molehill will I sit me down.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>To whom God will, there be the victory!</span><br/>
<span id='16'>For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Have chid me from the battle; swearing both</span><br/>
<span id='18'>They prosper best of all when I am thence.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>For what is in this world but grief and woe?</span><br/>
<span id='21'>O God! methinks it were a happy life,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>To be no better than a homely swain;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To sit upon a hill, as I do now,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Thereby to see the minutes how they run,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>How many make the hour full complete;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>How many hours bring about the day;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>How many days will finish up the year;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>How many years a mortal man may live.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>When this is known, then to divide the times:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>So many hours must I tend my flock;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>So many hours must I take my rest;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>So many hours must I contemplate;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>So many hours must I sport myself;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>So many days my ewes have been with young;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Pass'd over to the end they were created,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade</span><br/>
<span id='43'>To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy</span><br/>
<span id='45'>To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?</span><br/>
<span id='46'>O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Is far beyond a prince's delicates,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>His viands sparkling in a golden cup,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>His body couched in a curious bed,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Alarum. Enter a Son that has killed his father, dragging in the dead body</em></p>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>May be possessed with some store of crowns;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And I, that haply take them from him now,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>May yet ere night yield both my life and them</span><br/>
<span id='60'>To some man else, as this dead man doth me.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Who's this? O God! it is my father's face,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>O heavy times, begetting such events!</span><br/>
<span id='64'>From London by the king was I press'd forth;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Came on the part of York, press'd by his master;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And I, who at his hands received my life, him</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Have by my hands of life bereaved him.</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!</span><br/>
<span id='71'>My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee tear for tear;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Father that has killed his son, bringing in the body</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Father</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold:</span><br/>
<span id='81'>For I have bought it with an hundred blows.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>But let me see: is this our foeman's face?</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!</span><br/>
<span id='88'>O pity, God, this miserable age!</span><br/>
<span id='89'>What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!</span><br/>
<span id='92'>O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!</span><br/>
<span id='95'>O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!</span><br/>
<span id='96'>O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!</span><br/>
<span id='97'>The red rose and the white are on his face,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>The fatal colours of our striving houses:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>The one his purple blood right well resembles;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Wither one rose, and let the other flourish;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>If you contend, a thousand lives must wither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>How will my mother for a father's death</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Father</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>How will my wife for slaughter of my son</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>How will the country for these woful chances</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Misthink the king and not be satisfied!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Was ever son so rued a father's death?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Father</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Son</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit with the body</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Father</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>And so obsequious will thy father be,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Even for the loss of thee, having no more,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>As Priam was for all his valiant sons.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>For I have murdered where I should not kill.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit with the body</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Here sits a king more woful than you are.</span><br/>
<p><em>Alarums: excursions. Enter QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, and EXETER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PRINCE EDWARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>And Warwick rages like a chafed bull:</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain:</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Having the fearful flying hare in sight,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Are at our backs; and therefore hence amain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Away! for vengeance comes along with them:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed;</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Or else come after: I'll away before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Not that I fear to stay, but love to go</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Whither the queen intends. Forward; away!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Much Ado About Nothing</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Before Leonato's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a Messenger</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon</span><br/>
<span id='2'>comes this night to Messina.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off</span><br/>
<span id='4'>when I left him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>But few of any sort, and none of name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings</span><br/>
<span id='8'>home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath</span><br/>
<span id='9'>bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the</span><br/>
<span id='12'>promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better</span><br/>
<span id='14'>bettered expectation than you must expect of me to</span><br/>
<span id='15'>tell you how.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much</span><br/>
<span id='17'>glad of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>I have already delivered him letters, and there</span><br/>
<span id='19'>appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could</span><br/>
<span id='20'>not show itself modest enough without a badge of</span><br/>
<span id='21'>bitterness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Did he break out into tears?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>In great measure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces</span><br/>
<span id='25'>truer than those that are so washed. How much</span><br/>
<span id='26'>better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the</span><br/>
<span id='28'>wars or no?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>I know none of that name, lady: there was none such</span><br/>
<span id='30'>in the army of any sort.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>What is he that you ask for, niece?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>HERO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading</span><br/>
<span id='36'>the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged</span><br/>
<span id='37'>him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he</span><br/>
<span id='38'>killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath</span><br/>
<span id='39'>he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an</span><br/>
<span id='45'>excellent stomach.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>And a good soldier too, lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all</span><br/>
<span id='49'>honourable virtues.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>but for the stuffing,&mdash;well, we are all mortal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a</span><br/>
<span id='53'>kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit</span><br/>
<span id='55'>between them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last</span><br/>
<span id='57'>conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and</span><br/>
<span id='58'>now is the whole man governed with one: so that if</span><br/>
<span id='59'>he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him</span><br/>
<span id='60'>bear it for a difference between himself and his</span><br/>
<span id='61'>horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his</span><br/>
<span id='63'>companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Is't possible?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as</span><br/>
<span id='66'>the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the</span><br/>
<span id='67'>next block.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray</span><br/>
<span id='70'>you, who is his companion? Is there no young</span><br/>
<span id='71'>squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he</span><br/>
<span id='74'>is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker</span><br/>
<span id='75'>runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if</span><br/>
<span id='76'>he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a</span><br/>
<span id='77'>thousand pound ere a' be cured.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>I will hold friends with you, lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Do, good friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>You will never run mad, niece.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>No, not till a hot January.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Don Pedro is approached.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASAR</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your</span><br/>
<span id='84'>trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid</span><br/>
<span id='85'>cost, and you encounter it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of</span><br/>
<span id='87'>your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should</span><br/>
<span id='88'>remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides</span><br/>
<span id='89'>and happiness takes his leave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this</span><br/>
<span id='91'>is your daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Her mother hath many times told me so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this</span><br/>
<span id='96'>what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers</span><br/>
<span id='97'>herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an</span><br/>
<span id='98'>honourable father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not</span><br/>
<span id='100'>have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as</span><br/>
<span id='101'>like him as she is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Benedick: nobody marks you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Is it possible disdain should die while she hath</span><br/>
<span id='106'>such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come</span><br/>
<span id='108'>in her presence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I</span><br/>
<span id='110'>am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I</span><br/>
<span id='111'>would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard</span><br/>
<span id='112'>heart; for, truly, I love none.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>A dear happiness to women: they would else have</span><br/>
<span id='114'>been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God</span><br/>
<span id='115'>and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I</span><br/>
<span id='116'>had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man</span><br/>
<span id='117'>swear he loves me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some</span><br/>
<span id='119'>gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate</span><br/>
<span id='120'>scratched face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such</span><br/>
<span id='122'>a face as yours were.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and</span><br/>
<span id='126'>so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's</span><br/>
<span id='127'>name; I have done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>BEATRICE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio</span><br/>
<span id='130'>and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath</span><br/>
<span id='131'>invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at</span><br/>
<span id='132'>the least a month; and he heartily prays some</span><br/>
<span id='133'>occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no</span><br/>
<span id='134'>hypocrite, but prays from his heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.</span><br/>
<p><em>To DON JOHN</em></p>
<span id='136'>Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to</span><br/>
<span id='137'>the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank</span><br/>
<span id='139'>you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>LEONATO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Please it your grace lead on?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>I noted her not; but I looked on her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Is she not a modest young lady?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for</span><br/>
<span id='146'>my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak</span><br/>
<span id='147'>after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high</span><br/>
<span id='150'>praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little</span><br/>
<span id='151'>for a great praise: only this commendation I can</span><br/>
<span id='152'>afford her, that were she other than she is, she</span><br/>
<span id='153'>were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I</span><br/>
<span id='154'>do not like her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me</span><br/>
<span id='156'>truly how thou likest her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>Can the world buy such a jewel?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this</span><br/>
<span id='160'>with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a</span><br/>
<span id='162'>rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take</span><br/>
<span id='163'>you, to go in the song?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I</span><br/>
<span id='165'>looked on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such</span><br/>
<span id='167'>matter: there's her cousin, an she were not</span><br/>
<span id='168'>possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty</span><br/>
<span id='169'>as the first of May doth the last of December. But I</span><br/>
<span id='170'>hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the</span><br/>
<span id='172'>contrary, if Hero would be my wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world</span><br/>
<span id='174'>one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck</span><br/>
<span id='177'>into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter DON PEDRO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>What secret hath held you here, that you followed</span><br/>
<span id='180'>not to Leonato's?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>I would your grace would constrain me to tell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>I charge thee on thy allegiance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb</span><br/>
<span id='184'>man; I would have you think so; but, on my</span><br/>
<span id='185'>allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is</span><br/>
<span id='186'>in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Mark how short his answer is;&mdash;With Hero, Leonato's</span><br/>
<span id='188'>short daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>If this were so, so were it uttered.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor</span><br/>
<span id='191'>'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be</span><br/>
<span id='192'>so.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it</span><br/>
<span id='194'>should be otherwise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>By my troth, I speak my thought.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>That I love her, I feel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech89'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>That she is worthy, I know.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech90'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>That I neither feel how she should be loved nor</span><br/>
<span id='203'>know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that</span><br/>
<span id='204'>fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech91'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite</span><br/>
<span id='206'>of beauty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech92'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='207'>And never could maintain his part but in the force</span><br/>
<span id='208'>of his will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech93'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='209'>That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she</span><br/>
<span id='210'>brought me up, I likewise give her most humble</span><br/>
<span id='211'>thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my</span><br/>
<span id='212'>forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do</span><br/>
<span id='214'>them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the</span><br/>
<span id='215'>right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which</span><br/>
<span id='216'>I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech94'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech95'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood</span><br/>
<span id='220'>with love than I will get again with drinking, pick</span><br/>
<span id='221'>out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me</span><br/>
<span id='222'>up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of</span><br/>
<span id='223'>blind Cupid.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech96'><strong>DON PEDRO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='224'>Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou</span><br/>
<span id='225'>wilt prove a notable argument.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech97'><strong>BENEDICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>

<span id='229'>Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull</span><br/>

<span id='231'>The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible</span><br/>

<span id='234'>and in such great letters as they write 'Here is</span><br/>
<span id='235'>good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign</span><br/>

<span id='240'>I look for an earthquake too, then.</span><br/>

<span id='241'>Well, you temporize with the hours. In the</span><br/>
<span id='242'>meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to</span><br/>
<span id='243'>Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will</span><br/>
<span id='244'>not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made</span><br/>

<span id='262'>O, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='263'>When you went onward on this ended action,</span><br/>
<span id='264'>I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,</span><br/>
<span id='265'>That liked, but had a rougher task in hand</span><br/>
<span id='266'>Than to drive liking to the name of love:</span><br/>
<span id='267'>But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='268'>Have left their places vacant, in their rooms</span><br/>
<span id='269'>Come thronging soft and delicate desires,</span><br/>
<span id='270'>All prompting me how fair young Hero is,</span><br/>

<span id='272'>Thou wilt be like a lover presently</span><br/>

<span id='275'>And I will break with her and with her father,</span><br/>
<span id='276'>And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end</span><br/>
<span id='277'>That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?</span><br/>

<span id='278'>How sweetly you do minister to love,</span><br/>
<span id='279'>That know love's grief by his complexion!</span><br/>

<span id='281'>I would have salved it with a longer treatise.</span><br/>

<span id='286'>I know we shall have revelling to-night:</span><br/>
<span id='287'>I will assume thy part in some disguise</span><br/>
<span id='288'>And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,</span><br/>

<span id='291'>And strong encounter of my amorous tale:</span><br/>
<span id='292'>Then after to her father will I break;</span><br/>

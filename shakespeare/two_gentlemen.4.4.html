<h1>Two Gentlemen of Verona</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>The same.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LAUNCE, with his his Dog</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a</span><br/>
<span id='3'>puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or</span><br/>
<span id='4'>four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver</span><br/>
<span id='7'>him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he</span><br/>
<span id='9'>steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself</span><br/>
<span id='11'>in all companies! I would have, as one should say,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had</span><br/>
<span id='14'>more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I</span><br/>
<span id='16'>live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He</span><br/>
<span id='17'>thrusts me himself into the company of three or four</span><br/>
<span id='18'>gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had</span><br/>
<span id='19'>not been there&mdash;bless the mark!&mdash;a pissing while, but</span><br/>
<span id='20'>all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says</span><br/>
<span id='21'>one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him</span><br/>
<span id='22'>out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>I, having been acquainted with the smell before,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that</span><br/>
<span id='25'>whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip</span><br/>
<span id='26'>the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him</span><br/>
<span id='27'>the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you</span><br/>
<span id='28'>wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out</span><br/>
<span id='29'>of the chamber. How many masters would do this for</span><br/>
<span id='30'>his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the</span><br/>
<span id='31'>stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had</span><br/>
<span id='32'>been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese</span><br/>
<span id='33'>he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the</span><br/>
<span id='35'>trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I</span><br/>
<span id='37'>do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make</span><br/>
<span id='38'>water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst</span><br/>
<span id='39'>thou ever see me do such a trick?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PROTEUS and JULIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And will employ thee in some service presently.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>In what you please: I'll do what I can.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>I hope thou wilt.</span><br/>
<p><em>To LAUNCE</em></p>
<span id='44'>How now, you whoreson peasant!</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Where have you been these two days loitering?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>And what says she to my little jewel?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you</span><br/>
<span id='49'>currish thanks is good enough for such a present.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>But she received my dog?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him</span><br/>
<span id='52'>back again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>What, didst thou offer her this from me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LAUNCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by</span><br/>
<span id='55'>the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I</span><br/>
<span id='56'>offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of</span><br/>
<span id='57'>yours, and therefore the gift the greater.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Or ne'er return again into my sight.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Away, I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit LAUNCE</em></p>
<span id='61'>A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Sebastian, I have entertained thee,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Partly that I have need of such a youth</span><br/>
<span id='64'>That can with some discretion do my business,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Which, if my augury deceive me not,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Go presently and take this ring with thee,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Deliver it to Madam Silvia:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>She loved me well deliver'd it to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>She is dead, belike?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Not so; I think she lives.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Alas!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Why dost thou cry 'alas'?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>I cannot choose</span><br/>
<span id='79'>But pity her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>                  Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Because methinks that she loved you as well</span><br/>
<span id='82'>As you do love your lady Silvia:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>She dreams of him that has forgot her love;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>You dote on her that cares not for your love.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>'Tis pity love should be so contrary;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PROTEUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Well, give her that ring and therewithal</span><br/>
<span id='88'>This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady</span><br/>
<span id='89'>I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>How many women would do such a message?</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd</span><br/>
<span id='94'>A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him</span><br/>
<span id='96'>That with his very heart despiseth me?</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Because he loves her, he despiseth me;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Because I love him I must pity him.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>This ring I gave him when he parted from me,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>To bind him to remember my good will;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And now am I, unhappy messenger,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>To plead for that which I would not obtain,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>To carry that which I would have refused,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>I am my master's true-confirmed love;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>But cannot be true servant to my master,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Unless I prove false traitor to myself.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly</span><br/>
<span id='109'>As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SILVIA, attended</em></p>
<span id='110'>Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean</span><br/>
<span id='111'>To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>What would you with her, if that I be she?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>If you be she, I do entreat your patience</span><br/>
<span id='114'>To hear me speak the message I am sent on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>From whom?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>O, he sends you for a picture.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Ay, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Ursula, bring my picture here.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Go give your master this: tell him from me,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Madam, please you peruse this letter.&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:</span><br/>
<span id='126'>This is the letter to your ladyship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>I pray thee, let me look on that again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>It may not be; good madam, pardon me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>There, hold!</span><br/>
<span id='130'>I will not look upon your master's lines:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>I know they are stuff'd with protestations</span><br/>
<span id='132'>And full of new-found oaths; which he will break</span><br/>
<span id='133'>As easily as I do tear his paper.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>The more shame for him that he sends it me;</span><br/>
<span id='136'>For I have heard him say a thousand times</span><br/>
<span id='137'>His Julia gave it him at his departure.</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Though his false finger have profaned the ring,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>She thanks you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>What say'st thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>I thank you, madam, that you tender her.</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Dost thou know her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Almost as well as I do know myself:</span><br/>
<span id='146'>To think upon her woes I do protest</span><br/>
<span id='147'>That I have wept a hundred several times.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Is she not passing fair?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:</span><br/>
<span id='152'>When she did think my master loved her well,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:</span><br/>
<span id='154'>But since she did neglect her looking-glass</span><br/>
<span id='155'>And threw her sun-expelling mask away,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks</span><br/>
<span id='157'>And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>That now she is become as black as I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>How tall was she?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>About my stature; for at Pentecost,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>When all our pageants of delight were play'd,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Our youth got me to play the woman's part,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>As if the garment had been made for me:</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Therefore I know she is about my height.</span><br/>
<span id='167'>And at that time I made her weep agood,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>For I did play a lamentable part:</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning</span><br/>
<span id='170'>For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Which I so lively acted with my tears</span><br/>
<span id='172'>That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead</span><br/>
<span id='174'>If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>SILVIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!</span><br/>
<span id='177'>I weep myself to think upon thy words.</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this</span><br/>
<span id='179'>For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit SILVIA, with attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>JULIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.</span><br/>
<span id='182'>A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful</span><br/>
<span id='183'>I hope my master's suit will be but cold,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Since she respects my mistress' love so much.</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Alas, how love can trifle with itself!</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Here is her picture: let me see; I think,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>If I had such a tire, this face of mine</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Were full as lovely as is this of hers:</span><br/>
<span id='189'>And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Unless I flatter with myself too much.</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:</span><br/>
<span id='192'>If that be all the difference in his love,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.</span><br/>
<span id='196'>What should it be that he respects in her</span><br/>
<span id='197'>But I can make respective in myself,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>If this fond Love were not a blinded god?</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!</span><br/>
<span id='202'>And, were there sense in his idolatry,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>My substance should be statue in thy stead.</span><br/>
<span id='204'>I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes</span><br/>
<span id='207'>To make my master out of love with thee!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

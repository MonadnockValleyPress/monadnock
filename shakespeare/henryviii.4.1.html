<h1>Henry VIII</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>A street in Westminster.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter two Gentlemen, meeting one another</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>You're well met once again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>So are you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>You come to take your stand here, and behold</span><br/>
<span id='4'>The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>'Tis all my business. At our last encounter,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>'Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>This, general joy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>'Tis well: the citizens,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>In celebration of this day with shows,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Pageants and sights of honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Never greater,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>May I be bold to ask at what that contains,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>That paper in your hand?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Yes; 'tis the list</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Of those that claim their offices this day</span><br/>
<span id='20'>By custom of the coronation.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims</span><br/>
<span id='22'>To be high-steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>He to be earl marshal: you may read the rest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>I thank you, sir: had I not known those customs,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>I should have been beholding to your paper.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>The princess dowager? how goes her business?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>That I can tell you too. The Archbishop</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Of Canterbury, accompanied with other</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Learned and reverend fathers of his order,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off</span><br/>
<span id='32'>From Ampthill where the princess lay; to which</span><br/>
<span id='33'>She was often cited by them, but appear'd not:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And, to be short, for not appearance and</span><br/>
<span id='35'>The king's late scruple, by the main assent</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Of all these learned men she was divorced,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And the late marriage made of none effect</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Where she remains now sick.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Alas, good lady!</span><br/>
<p><em>Trumpets</em></p>
<span id='41'>The trumpets sound: stand close, the queen is coming.</span><br/>
<p><em>Hautboys</em></p>
<p><em>THE ORDER OF THE CORONATION</em></p>
<span id='42'>1. A lively flourish of Trumpets.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>2. Then, two Judges.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>3. Lord Chancellor, with the purse and mace</span><br/>
<span id='45'>before him.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>4. Choristers, singing.</span><br/>
<p><em>Music</em></p>
<span id='47'>5. Mayor of London, bearing the mace. Then</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Garter, in his coat of arms, and on his</span><br/>
<span id='49'>head a gilt copper crown.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>6. Marquess Dorset, bearing a sceptre of gold,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>on his head a demi-coronal of gold. With</span><br/>
<span id='52'>him, SURREY, bearing the rod of silver with</span><br/>
<span id='53'>the dove, crowned with an earl's coronet.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Collars of SS.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>7. SUFFOLK, in his robe of estate, his coronet</span><br/>
<span id='56'>on his head, bearing a long white wand, as</span><br/>
<span id='57'>high-steward. With him, NORFOLK, with the</span><br/>
<span id='58'>rod of marshalship, a coronet on his head.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Collars of SS.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>8. A canopy borne by four of the Cinque-ports;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>under it, QUEEN ANNE in her robe; in her hair</span><br/>
<span id='62'>richly adorned with pearl, crowned. On each</span><br/>
<span id='63'>side her, the Bishops of London and</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Winchester.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>9. The old Duchess of Norfolk, in a coronal of</span><br/>
<span id='66'>gold, wrought with flowers, bearing QUEEN</span><br/>
<span id='67'>ANNE's train.</span><br/>
<span id='68'>10. Certain Ladies or Countesses, with plain</span><br/>
<span id='69'>circlets of gold without flowers.</span><br/>
<p><em>They pass over the stage in order and state</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>A royal train, believe me. These I know:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Who's that that bears the sceptre?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Marquess Dorset:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>A bold brave gentleman. That should be</span><br/>
<span id='75'>The Duke of Suffolk?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>'Tis the same: high-steward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>And that my Lord of Norfolk?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Yes;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Heaven bless thee!</span><br/>
<p><em>Looking on QUEEN ANNE</em></p>
<span id='80'>Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Our king has all the Indies in his arms,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And more and richer, when he strains that lady:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>I cannot blame his conscience.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>They that bear</span><br/>
<span id='86'>The cloth of honour over her, are four barons</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Of the Cinque-ports.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Those men are happy; and so are all are near her.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>I take it, she that carries up the train</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>It is; and all the rest are countesses.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And sometimes falling ones.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>No more of that.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit procession, and then a great flourish of trumpets</em></p>
<p><em>Enter a third Gentleman</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>God save you, sir! where have you been broiling?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Among the crowd i' the Abbey; where a finger</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Could not be wedged in more: I am stifled</span><br/>
<span id='98'>With the mere rankness of their joy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>You saw</span><br/>
<span id='100'>The ceremony?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>                  That I did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>How was it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Well worth the seeing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Good sir, speak it to us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>As well as I am able. The rich stream</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen</span><br/>
<span id='107'>To a prepared place in the choir, fell off</span><br/>
<span id='108'>A distance from her; while her grace sat down</span><br/>
<span id='109'>To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>In a rich chair of state, opposing freely</span><br/>
<span id='111'>The beauty of her person to the people.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman</span><br/>
<span id='113'>That ever lay by man: which when the people</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Had the full view of, such a noise arose</span><br/>
<span id='115'>As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Doublets, I think,&mdash;flew up; and had their faces</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy</span><br/>
<span id='119'>I never saw before. Great-bellied women,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>That had not half a week to go, like rams</span><br/>
<span id='121'>In the old time of war, would shake the press,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And make 'em reel before 'em. No man living</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Could say 'This is my wife' there; all were woven</span><br/>
<span id='124'>So strangely in one piece.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>But, what follow'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>At length her grace rose, and with modest paces</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Came to the altar; where she kneel'd, and saint-like</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Then rose again and bow'd her to the people:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>When by the Archbishop of Canterbury</span><br/>
<span id='131'>She had all the royal makings of a queen;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Laid nobly on her: which perform'd, the choir,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>With all the choicest music of the kingdom,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>And with the same full state paced back again</span><br/>
<span id='138'>To York-place, where the feast is held.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Sir,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>You must no more call it York-place, that's past;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>For, since the cardinal fell, that title's lost:</span><br/>
<span id='142'>'Tis now the king's, and call'd Whitehall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>I know it;</span><br/>
<span id='144'>But 'tis so lately alter'd, that the old name</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Is fresh about me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>                  What two reverend bishops</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Were those that went on each side of the queen?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Stokesly and Gardiner; the one of Winchester,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Newly preferr'd from the king's secretary,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>The other, London.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>                  He of Winchester</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Is held no great good lover of the archbishop's,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>The virtuous Cranmer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>All the land knows that:</span><br/>
<span id='155'>However, yet there is no great breach; when it comes,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Who may that be, I pray you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>Thomas Cromwell;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>A man in much esteem with the king, and truly</span><br/>
<span id='160'>A worthy friend. The king has made him master</span><br/>
<span id='161'>O' the jewel house,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>And one, already, of the privy council.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>He will deserve more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Yes, without all doubt.</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, which</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Is to the court, and there ye shall be my guests:</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Something I can command. As I walk thither,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>I'll tell ye more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>Both</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>                  You may command us, sir.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Henry VIII</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The same. The council-chamber.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Cornets. Enter KING HENRY VIII, leaning on  CARDINAL WOLSEY's shoulder, the Nobles, and LOVELL;  CARDINAL WOLSEY places himself under KING HENRY VIII's feet on his right side</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>My life itself, and the best heart of it,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Thanks you for this great care: I stood i' the level</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Of a full-charged confederacy, and give thanks</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To you that choked it. Let be call'd before us</span><br/>
<span id='5'>That gentleman of Buckingham's; in person</span><br/>
<span id='6'>I'll hear him his confessions justify;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And point by point the treasons of his master</span><br/>
<span id='8'>He shall again relate.</span><br/>
<p><em>A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!' Enter  QUEEN KATHARINE, ushered by NORFOLK, and SUFFOLK:  she kneels. KING HENRY VIII riseth from his state, takes her up, kisses and placeth her by him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Nay, we must longer kneel: I am a suitor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Arise, and take place by us: half your suit</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Never name to us; you have half our power:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The other moiety, ere you ask, is given;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Repeat your will and take it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Thank your majesty.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>That you would love yourself, and in that love</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Not unconsider'd leave your honour, nor</span><br/>
<span id='17'>The dignity of your office, is the point</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Of my petition.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>                  Lady mine, proceed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>I am solicited, not by a few,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And those of true condition, that your subjects</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Are in great grievance: there have been commissions</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Sent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Of all their loyalties: wherein, although,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>My good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Most bitterly on you, as putter on</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Of these exactions, yet the king our master&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Whose honour heaven shield from soil!&mdash;even he</span><br/>
<span id='29'>escapes not</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks</span><br/>
<span id='31'>The sides of loyalty, and almost appears</span><br/>
<span id='32'>In loud rebellion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>NORFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>                  Not almost appears,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>The clothiers all, not able to maintain</span><br/>
<span id='36'>The many to them longing, have put off</span><br/>
<span id='37'>The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And lack of other means, in desperate manner</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Daring the event to the teeth, are all in uproar,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And danger serves among then!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Taxation!</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Wherein? and what taxation? My lord cardinal,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>You that are blamed for it alike with us,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Know you of this taxation?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Please you, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I know but of a single part, in aught</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Pertains to the state; and front but in that file</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Where others tell steps with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>No, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>You know no more than others; but you frame</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Things that are known alike; which are not wholesome</span><br/>
<span id='53'>To those which would not know them, and yet must</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Most pestilent to the bearing; and, to bear 'em,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>The back is sacrifice to the load. They say</span><br/>
<span id='58'>They are devised by you; or else you suffer</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Too hard an exclamation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Still exaction!</span><br/>
<span id='61'>The nature of it? in what kind, let's know,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Is this exaction?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>                  I am much too venturous</span><br/>
<span id='64'>In tempting of your patience; but am bolden'd</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Under your promised pardon. The subjects' grief</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Comes through commissions, which compel from each</span><br/>
<span id='67'>The sixth part of his substance, to be levied</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Without delay; and the pretence for this</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Is named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Allegiance in them; their curses now</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>This tractable obedience is a slave</span><br/>
<span id='74'>To each incensed will. I would your highness</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Would give it quick consideration, for</span><br/>
<span id='76'>There is no primer business.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>By my life,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>This is against our pleasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>And for me,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I have no further gone in this than by</span><br/>
<span id='81'>A single voice; and that not pass'd me but</span><br/>
<span id='82'>By learned approbation of the judges. If I am</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know</span><br/>
<span id='84'>My faculties nor person, yet will be</span><br/>
<span id='85'>The chronicles of my doing, let me say</span><br/>
<span id='86'>'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake</span><br/>
<span id='87'>That virtue must go through. We must not stint</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Our necessary actions, in the fear</span><br/>
<span id='89'>To cope malicious censurers; which ever,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow</span><br/>
<span id='91'>That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up</span><br/>
<span id='96'>For our best act. If we shall stand still,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>We should take root here where we sit, or sit</span><br/>
<span id='99'>State-statues only.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Things done well,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And with a care, exempt themselves from fear;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Things done without example, in their issue</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Of this commission? I believe, not any.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>We must not rend our subjects from our laws,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?</span><br/>
<span id='107'>A trembling contribution! Why, we take</span><br/>
<span id='108'>From every tree lop, bark, and part o' the timber;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>The air will drink the sap. To every county</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Where this is question'd send our letters, with</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Free pardon to each man that has denied</span><br/>
<span id='113'>The force of this commission: pray, look to't;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>I put it to your care.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>A word with you.</span><br/>
<p><em>To the Secretary</em></p>
<span id='116'>Let there be letters writ to every shire,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Of the king's grace and pardon. The grieved commons</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Hardly conceive of me; let it be noised</span><br/>
<span id='119'>That through our intercession this revokement</span><br/>
<span id='120'>And pardon comes: I shall anon advise you</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Further in the proceeding.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Secretary</em></p>
<p><em>Enter Surveyor</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Is run in your displeasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>It grieves many:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>The gentleman is learn'd, and a most rare speaker;</span><br/>
<span id='126'>To nature none more bound; his training such,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>That he may furnish and instruct great teachers,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>When these so noble benefits shall prove</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Not well disposed, the mind growing once corrupt,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Almost with ravish'd listening, could not find</span><br/>
<span id='135'>His hour of speech a minute; he, my lady,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Hath into monstrous habits put the graces</span><br/>
<span id='137'>That once were his, and is become as black</span><br/>
<span id='138'>As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>This was his gentleman in trust&mdash;of him</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount</span><br/>
<span id='141'>The fore-recited practises; whereof</span><br/>
<span id='142'>We cannot feel too little, hear too much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Most like a careful subject, have collected</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Out of the Duke of Buckingham.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Speak freely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Surveyor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>First, it was usual with him, every day</span><br/>
<span id='148'>It would infect his speech, that if the king</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Should without issue die, he'll carry it so</span><br/>
<span id='150'>To make the sceptre his: these very words</span><br/>
<span id='151'>I've heard him utter to his son-in-law,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Lord Abergavenny; to whom by oath he menaced</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Revenge upon the cardinal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Please your highness, note</span><br/>
<span id='155'>This dangerous conception in this point.</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Not friended by by his wish, to your high person</span><br/>
<span id='157'>His will is most malignant; and it stretches</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Beyond you, to your friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>My learn'd lord cardinal,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Deliver all with charity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>Speak on:</span><br/>
<span id='162'>How grounded he his title to the crown,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Upon our fail? to this point hast thou heard him</span><br/>
<span id='164'>At any time speak aught?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Surveyor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>He was brought to this</span><br/>
<span id='166'>By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>What was that Hopkins?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Surveyor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Sir, a Chartreux friar,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>His confessor, who fed him every minute</span><br/>
<span id='170'>With words of sovereignty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>How know'st thou this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Surveyor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Not long before your highness sped to France,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>The duke being at the Rose, within the parish</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand</span><br/>
<span id='175'>What was the speech among the Londoners</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Concerning the French journey: I replied,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>To the king's danger. Presently the duke</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Said, 'twas the fear, indeed; and that he doubted</span><br/>
<span id='180'>'Twould prove the verity of certain words</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Spoke by a holy monk; 'that oft,' says he,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit</span><br/>
<span id='183'>John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour</span><br/>
<span id='184'>To hear from him a matter of some moment:</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Whom after under the confession's seal</span><br/>
<span id='186'>He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke</span><br/>
<span id='187'>My chaplain to no creature living, but</span><br/>
<span id='188'>To me, should utter, with demure confidence</span><br/>
<span id='189'>This pausingly ensued: neither the king nor's heirs,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Tell you the duke, shall prosper: bid him strive</span><br/>
<span id='191'>To gain the love o' the commonalty: the duke</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Shall govern England.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>If I know you well,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>You were the duke's surveyor, and lost your office</span><br/>
<span id='195'>On the complaint o' the tenants: take good heed</span><br/>
<span id='196'>You charge not in your spleen a noble person</span><br/>
<span id='197'>And spoil your nobler soul: I say, take heed;</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Yes, heartily beseech you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>Let him on.</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Go forward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Surveyor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>     On my soul, I'll speak but truth.</span><br/>
<span id='202'>I told my lord the duke, by the devil's illusions</span><br/>
<span id='203'>The monk might be deceived; and that 'twas dangerous for him</span><br/>
<span id='204'>To ruminate on this so far, until</span><br/>
<span id='205'>It forged him some design, which, being believed,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>It was much like to do: he answer'd, 'Tush,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>It can do me no damage;' adding further,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>That, had the king in his last sickness fail'd,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>The cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Should have gone off.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='211'>Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!</span><br/>
<span id='212'>There's mischief in this man: canst thou say further?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Surveyor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='213'>I can, my liege.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>                  Proceed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Surveyor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='215'>Being at Greenwich,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>After your highness had reproved the duke</span><br/>
<span id='217'>About Sir William Blomer,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>I remember</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Of such a time: being my sworn servant,</span><br/>
<span id='220'>The duke retain'd him his. But on; what hence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>Surveyor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>'If,' quoth he, 'I for this had been committed,</span><br/>
<span id='222'>As, to the Tower, I thought, I would have play'd</span><br/>
<span id='223'>The part my father meant to act upon</span><br/>
<span id='224'>The usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury,</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Made suit to come in's presence; which if granted,</span><br/>
<span id='226'>As he made semblance of his duty, would</span><br/>
<span id='227'>Have put his knife to him.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='228'>A giant traitor!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='229'>Now, madam, may his highness live in freedom,</span><br/>
<span id='230'>and this man out of prison?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>QUEEN KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='231'>God mend all!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>

<span id='232'>There's something more would out of thee; what say'st?</span><br/>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Surveyor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='233'>After 'the duke his father,' with 'the knife,'</span><br/>
<span id='234'>He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes</span><br/>
<span id='236'>He did discharge a horrible oath; whose tenor</span><br/>
<span id='237'>Was,&mdash;were he evil used, he would outgo</span><br/>
<span id='238'>His father by as much as a performance</span><br/>
<span id='239'>Does an irresolute purpose.</span><br/>

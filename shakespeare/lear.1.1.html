<h1>King Lear</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>King Lear's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I thought the king had more affected the Duke of</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Albany than Cornwall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>It did always seem so to us: but now, in the</span><br/>
<span id='4'>division of the kingdom, it appears not which of</span><br/>
<span id='5'>the dukes he values most; for equalities are so</span><br/>
<span id='6'>weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice</span><br/>
<span id='7'>of either's moiety.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Is not this your son, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have</span><br/>
<span id='10'>so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am</span><br/>
<span id='11'>brazed to it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>I cannot conceive you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon</span><br/>
<span id='14'>she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son</span><br/>
<span id='15'>for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Do you smell a fault?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it</span><br/>
<span id='18'>being so proper.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year</span><br/>
<span id='20'>elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>though this knave came something saucily into the</span><br/>
<span id='22'>world before he was sent for, yet was his mother</span><br/>
<span id='23'>fair; there was good sport at his making, and the</span><br/>
<span id='24'>whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this</span><br/>
<span id='25'>noble gentleman, Edmund?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>No, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my</span><br/>
<span id='28'>honourable friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>My services to your lordship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>I must love you, and sue to know you better.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Sir, I shall study deserving.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>He hath been out nine years, and away he shall</span><br/>
<span id='33'>again. The king is coming.</span><br/>
<p><em>Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>I shall, my liege.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Give me the map there. Know that we have divided</span><br/>
<span id='38'>In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To shake all cares and business from our age;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Conferring them on younger strengths, while we</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And you, our no less loving son of Albany,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>We have this hour a constant will to publish</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife</span><br/>
<span id='45'>May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Since now we will divest us both of rule,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Interest of territory, cares of state,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Which of you shall we say doth love us most?</span><br/>
<span id='52'>That we our largest bounty may extend</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Our eldest-born, speak first.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>As much as child e'er loved, or father found;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Beyond all manner of so much I love you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>[Aside]  What shall Cordelia do?</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Love, and be silent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Sir, I am made</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Of the self-same metal that my sister is,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And prize me at her worth. In my true heart</span><br/>
<span id='73'>I find she names my very deed of love;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Only she comes too short: that I profess</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Myself an enemy to all other joys,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Which the most precious square of sense possesses;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And find I am alone felicitate</span><br/>
<span id='78'>In your dear highness' love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>[Aside]	Then poor Cordelia!</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's</span><br/>
<span id='81'>More richer than my tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>To thee and thine hereditary ever</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>No less in space, validity, and pleasure,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Although the last, not least; to whose young love</span><br/>
<span id='87'>The vines of France and milk of Burgundy</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw</span><br/>
<span id='89'>A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Nothing, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Nothing!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave</span><br/>
<span id='95'>My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty</span><br/>
<span id='96'>According to my bond; nor more nor less.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Lest it may mar your fortunes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Good my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Return those duties back as are right fit,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Obey you, love you, and most honour you.</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Why have my sisters husbands, if they say</span><br/>
<span id='104'>They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Half my love with him, half my care and duty:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>To love my father all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>But goes thy heart with this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Ay, good my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>So young, and so untender?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>So young, my lord, and true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>By all the operation of the orbs</span><br/>
<span id='117'>From whom we do exist, and cease to be;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Here I disclaim all my paternal care,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Propinquity and property of blood,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>And as a stranger to my heart and me</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Or he that makes his generation messes</span><br/>
<span id='123'>To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>As thou my sometime daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Good my liege,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Peace, Kent!</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Come not between the dragon and his wrath.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>I loved her most, and thought to set my rest</span><br/>
<span id='130'>On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!</span><br/>
<span id='131'>So be my grave my peace, as here I give</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.</span><br/>
<span id='136'>I do invest you jointly with my power,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Pre-eminence, and all the large effects</span><br/>
<span id='138'>That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>With reservation of an hundred knights,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain</span><br/>
<span id='142'>The name, and all the additions to a king;</span><br/>
<span id='143'>The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>This coronet part betwixt you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Giving the crown</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Royal Lear,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>As my great patron thought on in my prayers,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Let it fall rather, though the fork invade</span><br/>
<span id='152'>The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>And, in thy best consideration, cheque</span><br/>
<span id='158'>This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Reverbs no hollowness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Kent, on thy life, no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>My life I never held but as a pawn</span><br/>
<span id='164'>To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Thy safety being the motive.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Out of my sight!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>See better, Lear; and let me still remain</span><br/>
<span id='168'>The true blank of thine eye.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>Now, by Apollo,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>                  Now, by Apollo, king,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>O, vassal! miscreant!</span><br/>
<p><em>Laying his hand on his sword</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ALBANY and CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>Dear sir, forbear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>Do:</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>I'll tell thee thou dost evil.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Hear me, recreant!</span><br/>
<span id='180'>On thine allegiance, hear me!</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride</span><br/>
<span id='183'>To come between our sentence and our power,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Our potency made good, take thy reward.</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Five days we do allot thee, for provision</span><br/>
<span id='187'>To shield thee from diseases of the world;</span><br/>
<span id='188'>And on the sixth to turn thy hated back</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>This shall not be revoked.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.</span><br/>
<p><em>To CORDELIA</em></p>
<span id='195'>The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!</span><br/>
<p><em>To REGAN and GONERIL</em></p>
<span id='197'>And your large speeches may your deeds approve,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>That good effects may spring from words of love.</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;</span><br/>
<span id='200'>He'll shape his old course in a country new.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE, BURGUNDY, and Attendants</em></p>

<span id='speech52'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>

<span id='201'>Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>My lord of Burgundy.</span><br/>
<span id='203'>We first address towards you, who with this king</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Will you require in present dower with her,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Or cease your quest of love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='207'>Most royal majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Nor will you tender less.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>Right noble Burgundy,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;</span><br/>
<span id='212'>But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:</span><br/>
<span id='213'>If aught within that little seeming substance,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>She's there, and she is yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>I know no answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>Will you, with those infirmities she owes,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,</span><br/>
<span id='220'>Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,</span><br/>
<span id='221'>Take her, or leave her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='222'>Pardon me, royal sir;</span><br/>
<span id='223'>Election makes not up on such conditions.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='224'>Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,</span><br/>
<span id='225'>I tell you all her wealth.</span><br/>
<p><em>To KING OF FRANCE</em></p>
<span id='226'>For you, great king,</span><br/>
<span id='227'>I would not from your love make such a stray,</span><br/>
<span id='228'>To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you</span><br/>
<span id='229'>To avert your liking a more worthier way</span><br/>
<span id='230'>Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Almost to acknowledge hers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='232'>This is most strange,</span><br/>
<span id='233'>That she, that even but now was your best object,</span><br/>
<span id='234'>The argument of your praise, balm of your age,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time</span><br/>
<span id='236'>Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle</span><br/>
<span id='237'>So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence</span><br/>
<span id='238'>Must be of such unnatural degree,</span><br/>
<span id='239'>That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection</span><br/>
<span id='240'>Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,</span><br/>
<span id='241'>Must be a faith that reason without miracle</span><br/>
<span id='242'>Could never plant in me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='243'>I yet beseech your majesty,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='244'>If for I want that glib and oily art,</span><br/>
<span id='245'>To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,</span><br/>
<span id='246'>I'll do't before I speak,&mdash;that you make known</span><br/>
<span id='247'>It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,</span><br/>
<span id='248'>No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,</span><br/>
<span id='249'>That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;</span><br/>
<span id='250'>But even for want of that for which I am richer,</span><br/>
<span id='251'>A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue</span><br/>
<span id='252'>As I am glad I have not, though not to have it</span><br/>
<span id='253'>Hath lost me in your liking.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='254'>Better thou</span><br/>
<span id='255'>Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='256'>Is it but this,&mdash;a tardiness in nature</span><br/>
<span id='257'>Which often leaves the history unspoke</span><br/>
<span id='258'>That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,</span><br/>
<span id='259'>What say you to the lady? Love's not love</span><br/>
<span id='260'>When it is mingled with regards that stand</span><br/>
<span id='261'>Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?</span><br/>
<span id='262'>She is herself a dowry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='263'>Royal Lear,</span><br/>
<span id='264'>Give but that portion which yourself proposed,</span><br/>
<span id='265'>And here I take Cordelia by the hand,</span><br/>
<span id='266'>Duchess of Burgundy.</span><br/>

<span id='267'>Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>BURGUNDY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='268'>I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father</span><br/>
<span id='269'>That you must lose a husband.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='270'>Peace be with Burgundy!</span><br/>
<span id='271'>Since that respects of fortune are his love,</span><br/>
<span id='272'>I shall not be his wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='273'>Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;</span><br/>
<span id='274'>Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!</span><br/>
<span id='275'>Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:</span><br/>
<span id='276'>Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.</span><br/>
<span id='277'>Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect</span><br/>
<span id='278'>My love should kindle to inflamed respect.</span><br/>
<span id='279'>Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,</span><br/>
<span id='280'>Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:</span><br/>
<span id='281'>Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy</span><br/>
<span id='282'>Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.</span><br/>
<span id='283'>Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:</span><br/>
<span id='284'>Thou losest here, a better where to find.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='285'>Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we</span><br/>
<span id='286'>Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see</span><br/>
<span id='287'>That face of hers again. Therefore be gone</span><br/>
<span id='288'>Without our grace, our love, our benison.</span><br/>
<span id='289'>Come, noble Burgundy.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL, REGAN, and CORDELIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='290'>Bid farewell to your sisters.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='291'>The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes</span><br/>
<span id='292'>Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;</span><br/>
<span id='293'>And like a sister am most loath to call</span><br/>
<span id='294'>Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:</span><br/>
<span id='295'>To your professed bosoms I commit him</span><br/>
<span id='296'>But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,</span><br/>
<span id='297'>I would prefer him to a better place.</span><br/>
<span id='298'>So, farewell to you both.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='299'>Prescribe not us our duties.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='300'>Let your study</span><br/>
<span id='301'>Be to content your lord, who hath received you</span><br/>
<span id='302'>At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,</span><br/>
<span id='303'>And well are worth the want that you have wanted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>CORDELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='304'>Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:</span><br/>
<span id='305'>Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.</span><br/>
<span id='306'>Well may you prosper!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>KING OF FRANCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='307'>Come, my fair Cordelia.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='308'>Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what</span><br/>
<span id='309'>most nearly appertains to us both. I think our</span><br/>
<span id='310'>father will hence to-night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='311'>That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='312'>You see how full of changes his age is; the</span><br/>
<span id='313'>observation we have made of it hath not been</span><br/>
<span id='314'>little: he always loved our sister most; and</span><br/>
<span id='315'>with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off</span><br/>
<span id='316'>appears too grossly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='317'>'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever</span><br/>
<span id='318'>but slenderly known himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='319'>The best and soundest of his time hath been but</span><br/>
<span id='320'>rash; then must we look to receive from his age,</span><br/>
<span id='321'>not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed</span><br/>
<span id='322'>condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness</span><br/>
<span id='323'>that infirm and choleric years bring with them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='324'>Such unconstant starts are we like to have from</span><br/>
<span id='325'>him as this of Kent's banishment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='326'>There is further compliment of leavetaking</span><br/>
<span id='327'>between France and him. Pray you, let's hit</span><br/>
<span id='328'>together: if our father carry authority with</span><br/>
<span id='329'>such dispositions as he bears, this last</span><br/>
<span id='330'>surrender of his will but offend us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='331'>We shall further think on't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='332'>We must do something, and i' the heat.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

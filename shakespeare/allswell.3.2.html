<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Rousillon. The Count's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter COUNTESS and Clown</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>It hath happened all as I would have had it, save</span><br/>
<span id='2'>that he comes not along with her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very</span><br/>
<span id='4'>melancholy man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>By what observance, I pray you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the</span><br/>
<span id='7'>ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his</span><br/>
<span id='8'>teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of</span><br/>
<span id='9'>melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.</span><br/>
<p><em>Opening a letter</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our</span><br/>
<span id='12'>old ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothing</span><br/>
<span id='13'>like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>the brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin to</span><br/>
<span id='15'>love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>What have we here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>E'en that you have there.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>[Reads]  I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath</span><br/>
<span id='19'>recovered the king, and undone me. I have wedded</span><br/>
<span id='20'>her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the 'not'</span><br/>
<span id='21'>eternal. You shall hear I am run away: know it</span><br/>
<span id='22'>before the report come. If there be breadth enough</span><br/>
<span id='23'>in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty</span><br/>
<span id='24'>to you.	Your unfortunate son,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>BERTRAM.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>To fly the favours of so good a king;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>To pluck his indignation on thy head</span><br/>
<span id='29'>By the misprising of a maid too virtuous</span><br/>
<span id='30'>For the contempt of empire.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Clown</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two</span><br/>
<span id='32'>soldiers and my young lady!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>What is the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some</span><br/>
<span id='35'>comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as I</span><br/>
<span id='36'>thought he would.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Why should he be killed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>the danger is in standing to't; that's the loss of</span><br/>
<span id='40'>men, though it be the getting of children. Here</span><br/>
<span id='41'>they come will tell you more: for my part, I only</span><br/>
<span id='42'>hear your son was run away.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter HELENA, and two Gentlemen</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Save you, good madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Do not say so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>That the first face of neither, on the start,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>We met him thitherward; for thence we came,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And, after some dispatch in hand at court,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Thither we bend again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='55'>When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which</span><br/>
<span id='56'>never shall come off, and show me a child begotten</span><br/>
<span id='57'>of thy body that I am father to, then call me</span><br/>
<span id='58'>husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'</span><br/>
<span id='59'>This is a dreadful sentence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Brought you this letter, gentlemen?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Ay, madam;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>But I do wash his name out of my blood,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Ay, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>         And to be a soldier?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>The duke will lay upon him all the honour</span><br/>
<span id='72'>That good convenience claims.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Return you thither?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>[Reads]  Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>'Tis bitter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>                  Find you that there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Ay, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his</span><br/>
<span id='80'>heart was not consenting to.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Nothing in France, until he have no wife!</span><br/>
<span id='82'>There's nothing here that is too good for him</span><br/>
<span id='83'>But only she; and she deserves a lord</span><br/>
<span id='84'>That twenty such rude boys might tend upon</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>A servant only, and a gentleman</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Which I have sometime known.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Parolles, was it not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Ay, my good lady, he.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>My son corrupts a well-derived nature</span><br/>
<span id='92'>With his inducement.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Indeed, good lady,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>The fellow has a deal of that too much,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Which holds him much to have.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>You're welcome, gentlemen.</span><br/>
<span id='97'>I will entreat you, when you see my son,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>To tell him that his sword can never win</span><br/>
<span id='99'>The honour that he loses: more I'll entreat you</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Written to bear along.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>We serve you, madam,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>In that and all your worthiest affairs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Not so, but as we change our courtesies.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Will you draw near!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt COUNTESS and Gentlemen</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HELENA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Nothing in France, until he has no wife!</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I</span><br/>
<span id='109'>That chase thee from thy country and expose</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Those tender limbs of thine to the event</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Of the none-sparing war? and is it I</span><br/>
<span id='112'>That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>That ride upon the violent speed of fire,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Whoever charges on his forward breast,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>And, though I kill him not, I am the cause</span><br/>
<span id='122'>His death was so effected: better 'twere</span><br/>
<span id='123'>I met the ravin lion when he roar'd</span><br/>
<span id='124'>With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere</span><br/>
<span id='125'>That all the miseries which nature owes</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>As oft it loses all: I will be gone;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>My being here it is that holds thee hence:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Shall I stay here to do't?  no, no, although</span><br/>
<span id='131'>The air of paradise did fan the house</span><br/>
<span id='132'>And angels officed all: I will be gone,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>That pitiful rumour may report my flight,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!</span><br/>
<span id='135'>For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<h1>Richard III</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Before Lord Hastings' house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter a Messenger</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>What, ho! my lord!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>[Within]  Who knocks at the door?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>A messenger from the Lord Stanley.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HASTINGS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>What is't o'clock?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Upon the stroke of four.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>So it should seem by that I have to say.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>First, he commends him to your noble lordship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>And then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>And then he sends you word</span><br/>
<span id='11'>He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Besides, he says there are two councils held;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And that may be determined at the one</span><br/>
<span id='14'>which may make you and him to rue at the other.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>If presently you will take horse with him,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And with all speed post with him toward the north,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>To shun the danger that his soul divines.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Bid him not fear the separated councils</span><br/>
<span id='21'>His honour and myself are at the one,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And at the other is my servant Catesby</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Whereof I shall not have intelligence.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond</span><br/>
<span id='27'>To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers</span><br/>
<span id='28'>To fly the boar before the boar pursues,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Were to incense the boar to follow us</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Go, bid thy master rise and come to me</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And we will both together to the Tower,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter CATESBY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CATESBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Many good morrows to my noble lord!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring</span><br/>
<span id='37'>What news, what news, in this our tottering state?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CATESBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And I believe twill never stand upright</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CATESBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Ay, my good lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CATESBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Upon his party for the gain thereof:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And thereupon he sends you this good news,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>That this same very day your enemies,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Because they have been still mine enemies:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>To bar my master's heirs in true descent,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>God knows I will not do it, to the death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CATESBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>That they who brought me in my master's hate</span><br/>
<span id='59'>I live to look upon their tragedy.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>I tell thee, Catesby&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CATESBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>What, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Ere a fortnight make me elder,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CATESBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>When men are unprepared and look not for it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out</span><br/>
<span id='67'>With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do</span><br/>
<span id='68'>With some men else, who think themselves as safe</span><br/>
<span id='69'>As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear</span><br/>
<span id='70'>To princely Richard and to Buckingham.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CATESBY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>The princes both make high account of you;</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='72'>For they account his head upon the bridge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>I know they do; and I have well deserved it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter STANLEY</em></p>
<span id='74'>Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>STANLEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>I do not like these several councils, I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>My lord,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I hold my life as dear as you do yours;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And never in my life, I do protest,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Think you, but that I know our state secure,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>I would be so triumphant as I am?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>STANLEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!</span><br/>
<span id='91'>What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?</span><br/>
<span id='93'>To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LORD STANLEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>They, for their truth, might better wear their heads</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Than some that have accused them wear their hats.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>But come, my lord, let us away.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Pursuivant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY</em></p>
<span id='98'>How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Pursuivant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>The better that your lordship please to ask.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Than when I met thee last where now we meet:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>By the suggestion of the queen's allies;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>But now, I tell thee&mdash;keep it to thyself&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='105'>This day those enemies are put to death,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And I in better state than e'er I was.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Pursuivant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>God hold it, to your honour's good content!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Throws him his purse</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>Pursuivant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>God save your lordship!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter a Priest</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Priest</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>I am in your debt for your last exercise;</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.</span><br/>
<p><em>He whispers in his ear</em></p>
<p><em>Enter BUCKINGHAM</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Good faith, and when I met this holy man,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Those men you talk of came into my mind.</span><br/>
<span id='119'>What, go you toward the Tower?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay</span><br/>
<span id='121'>I shall return before your lordship thence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>[Aside]  And supper too, although thou know'st it not.</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Come, will you go?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>I'll wait upon your lordship.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

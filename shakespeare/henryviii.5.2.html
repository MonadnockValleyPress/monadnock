<h1>Henry VIII</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Before the council-chamber. Pursuivants, Pages,  &amp;c.</h4>

<blockquote>
<span id='1'>attending.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CRANMER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>I hope I am not too late; and yet the gentleman,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>That was sent to me from the council, pray'd me</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To make great haste. All fast? what means this? Ho!</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Who waits there? Sure, you know me?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Keeper</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Keeper</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Yes, my lord;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>But yet I cannot help you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Why?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DOCTOR BUTTS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Keeper</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Your grace must wait till you be call'd for.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>So.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DOCTOR BUTTS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>[Aside]  This is a piece of malice. I am glad</span><br/>
<span id='12'>I came this way so happily: the king</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Shall understand it presently.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CRANMER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>[Aside]	'Tis Butts,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>The king's physician: as he pass'd along,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Pray heaven, he sound not my disgrace! For certain,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>This is of purpose laid by some that hate me&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>God turn their hearts! I never sought their malice&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To quench mine honour: they would shame to make me</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Wait else at door, a fellow-counsellor,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>'Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys. But their pleasures</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Must be fulfill'd, and I attend with patience.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the KING HENRY VIII and DOCTOR BUTTS at a window above</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DOCTOR BUTTS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>I'll show your grace the strangest sight&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>What's that, Butts?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DOCTOR BUTTS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>I think your highness saw this many a day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Body o' me, where is it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DOCTOR BUTTS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>There, my lord:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>The high promotion of his grace of Canterbury;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Who holds his state at door, 'mongst pursuivants,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Pages, and footboys.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Ha! 'tis he, indeed:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Is this the honour they do one another?</span><br/>
<span id='34'>'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought</span><br/>
<span id='35'>They had parted so much honesty among 'em</span><br/>
<span id='36'>At least, good manners, as not thus to suffer</span><br/>
<span id='37'>A man of his place, and so near our favour,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>To dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And at the door too, like a post with packets.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>By holy Mary, Butts, there's knavery:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close:</span><br/>
<span id='42'>We shall hear more anon.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<em>Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Kill the poys and the luggage! 'tis expressly</span><br/>
<span id='2'>against the law of arms: 'tis as arrant a piece of</span><br/>
<span id='3'>knavery, mark you now, as can be offer't; in your</span><br/>
<span id='4'>conscience, now, is it not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive; and the</span><br/>
<span id='6'>cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done</span><br/>
<span id='7'>this slaughter: besides, they have burned and</span><br/>
<span id='8'>carried away all that was in the king's tent;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>wherefore the king, most worthily, hath caused every</span><br/>
<span id='10'>soldier to cut his prisoner's throat. O, 'tis a</span><br/>
<span id='11'>gallant king!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower. What</span><br/>
<span id='13'>call you the town's name where Alexander the Pig was born!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Alexander the Great.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Why, I pray you, is not pig great? the pig, or the</span><br/>
<span id='16'>great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the</span><br/>
<span id='17'>magnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the phrase</span><br/>
<span id='18'>is a little variations.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon; his</span><br/>
<span id='20'>father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I</span><br/>
<span id='22'>tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the</span><br/>
<span id='23'>'orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons</span><br/>
<span id='24'>between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>look you, is both alike. There is a river in</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Macedon; and there is also moreover a river at</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Monmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth; but it is</span><br/>
<span id='28'>out of my prains what is the name of the other</span><br/>
<span id='29'>river; but 'tis all one, 'tis alike as my fingers is</span><br/>
<span id='30'>to my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you</span><br/>
<span id='31'>mark Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's life</span><br/>
<span id='32'>is come after it indifferent well; for there is</span><br/>
<span id='33'>figures in all things. Alexander, God knows, and</span><br/>
<span id='34'>you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his</span><br/>
<span id='35'>wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his</span><br/>
<span id='36'>displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a</span><br/>
<span id='37'>little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and</span><br/>
<span id='38'>his angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Our king is not like him in that: he never killed</span><br/>
<span id='40'>any of his friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>It is not well done, mark you now take the tales out</span><br/>
<span id='42'>of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak</span><br/>
<span id='43'>but in the figures and comparisons of it: as</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his</span><br/>
<span id='45'>ales and his cups; so also Harry Monmouth, being in</span><br/>
<span id='46'>his right wits and his good judgments, turned away</span><br/>
<span id='47'>the fat knight with the great belly-doublet: he</span><br/>
<span id='48'>was full of jests, and gipes, and knaveries, and</span><br/>
<span id='49'>mocks; I have forgot his name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Sir John Falstaff.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>That is he: I'll tell you there is good men porn at Monmouth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GOWER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Here comes his majesty.</span><br/>
<p><em>Alarum. Enter KING HENRY, and forces; WARWICK, GLOUCESTER, EXETER, and others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>I was not angry since I came to France</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>If they will fight with us, bid them come down,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Or void the field; they do offend our sight:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>If they'll do neither, we will come to them,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And make them skirr away, as swift as stones</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And not a man of them that we shall take</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MONTJOY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>EXETER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>His eyes are humbler than they used to be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>How now! what means this, herald? know'st thou not</span><br/>
<span id='67'>That I have  fined these bones of mine for ransom?</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Comest thou again for ransom?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MONTJOY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>No, great king:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>I come to thee for charitable licence,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>That we may wander o'er this bloody field</span><br/>
<span id='72'>To look our dead, and then to bury them;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>To sort our nobles from our common men.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>For many of our princes&mdash;woe the while!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs</span><br/>
<span id='77'>In blood of princes; and their wounded steeds</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>To view the field in safety and dispose</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Of their dead bodies!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>I tell thee truly, herald,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>I know not if the day be ours or no;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>For yet a many of your horsemen peer</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And gallop o'er the field.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MONTJOY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>The day is yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!</span><br/>
<span id='89'>What is this castle call'd that stands hard by?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MONTJOY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>They call it Agincourt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Then call we this the field of Agincourt,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Your grandfather of famous memory, an't please your</span><br/>
<span id='94'>majesty, and your great-uncle Edward the Plack</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Prince of Wales, as I have read in the chronicles,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>fought a most prave pattle here in France.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>They did, Fluellen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Your majesty says very true: if your majesties is</span><br/>
<span id='99'>remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a</span><br/>
<span id='100'>garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Monmouth caps; which, your majesty know, to this</span><br/>
<span id='102'>hour is an honourable badge of the service; and I do</span><br/>
<span id='103'>believe your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek</span><br/>
<span id='104'>upon Saint Tavy's day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>I wear it for a memorable honour;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.</span><br/>

<span id='107'>All the water in Wye cannot wash your majesty's</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that:</span><br/>
<span id='109'>God pless it and preserve it, as long as it pleases</span><br/>
<span id='110'>his grace, and his majesty too!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>

<span id='111'>Thanks, good my countryman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>FLUELLEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>By Jeshu, I am your majesty's countryman, I care not</span><br/>
<span id='113'>who know it; I will confess it to all the 'orld: I</span><br/>
<span id='114'>need not to be ashamed of your majesty, praised be</span><br/>
<span id='115'>God, so long as your majesty is an honest man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>God keep me so! Our heralds go with him:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Bring me just notice of the numbers dead</span><br/>
<span id='118'>On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither.</span><br/>
<p><em>Points to WILLIAMS. Exeunt Heralds with Montjoy</em></p>

<span id='120'>Soldier, why wearest thou that glove in thy cap?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>WILLIAMS</strong></a>

<span id='speech35'><strong>WILLIAMS</strong></a>

<span id='124'>An't please your majesty, a rascal that swaggered</span><br/>

<span id='126'>challenge this glove, I have sworn to take him a box</span><br/>
<span id='127'>o' th' ear: or if I can see my glove in his cap,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>which he swore, as he was a soldier, he would wear</span><br/>
<span id='129'>if alive, I will strike it out soundly.</span><br/>

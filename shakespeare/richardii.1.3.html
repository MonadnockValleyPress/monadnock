<h1>Richard II</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The lists at Coventry.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the Lord Marshal and the DUKE OF AUMERLE</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Lord Marshal</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>Lord Marshal</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay</span><br/>
<span id='6'>For nothing but his majesty's approach.</span><br/>
<p><em>The trumpets sound, and KING RICHARD enters with  his nobles, JOHN OF GAUNT, BUSHY, BAGOT, GREEN, and  others. When they are set, enter THOMAS MOWBRAY in arms, defendant, with a Herald</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Marshal, demand of yonder champion</span><br/>
<span id='8'>The cause of his arrival here in arms:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Ask him his name and orderly proceed</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To swear him in the justice of his cause.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Lord Marshal</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>In God's name and the king's, say who thou art</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>THOMAS MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Who hither come engaged by my oath&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Which God defend a knight should violate!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Both to defend my loyalty and truth</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To God, my king and my succeeding issue,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To prove him, in defending of myself,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>A traitor to my God, my king, and me:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!</span><br/>
<p><em>The trumpets sound. Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE, appellant, in armour, with a Herald</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Both who he is and why he cometh hither</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Thus plated in habiliments of war,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And formally, according to our law,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Depose him in the justice of his cause.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Lord Marshal</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Before King Richard in his royal lists?</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Lord Marshal</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>On pain of death, no person be so bold</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Except the marshal and such officers</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Appointed to direct these fair designs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And bow my knee before his majesty:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>For Mowbray and myself are like two men</span><br/>
<span id='49'>That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Then let us take a ceremonious leave</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And loving farewell of our several friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Lord Marshal</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>The appellant in all duty greets your highness,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>We will descend and fold him in our arms.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>So be thy fortune in this royal fight!</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>O let no noble eye profane a tear</span><br/>
<span id='60'>For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>As confident as is the falcon's flight</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>My loving lord, I take my leave of you;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Not sick, although I have to do with death,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet</span><br/>
<span id='68'>The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>O thou, the earthly author of my blood,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up</span><br/>
<span id='72'>To reach at victory above my head,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Even in the lusty havior of his son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Be swift like lightning in the execution;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Fall like amazing thunder on the casque</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>THOMAS MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>However God or fortune cast my lot,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>A loyal, just and upright gentleman:</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Never did captive with a freer heart</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace</span><br/>
<span id='90'>His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>More than my dancing soul doth celebrate</span><br/>
<span id='92'>This feast of battle with mine adversary.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>As gentle and as jocund as to jest</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Farewell, my lord: securely I espy</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Order the trial, marshal, and begin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Lord Marshal</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Lord Marshal</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>First Herald</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>On pain to be found false and recreant,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>A traitor to his God, his king and him;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And dares him to set forward to the fight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Second Herald</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>On pain to be found false and recreant,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Both to defend himself and to approve</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Courageously and with a free desire</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Attending but the signal to begin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Lord Marshal</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.</span><br/>
<p><em>A charge sounded</em></p>
<span id='118'>Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>And both return back to their chairs again:</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound</span><br/>
<span id='122'>While we return these dukes what we decree.</span><br/>
<p><em>A long flourish</em></p>
<span id='123'>Draw near,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And list what with our council we have done.</span><br/>
<span id='125'>For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd</span><br/>
<span id='126'>With that dear blood which it hath fostered;</span><br/>
<span id='127'>And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And for we think the eagle-winged pride</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>With rival-hating envy, set on you</span><br/>
<span id='132'>To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace</span><br/>
<span id='138'>And make us wade even in our kindred's blood,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Therefore, we banish you our territories:</span><br/>
<span id='140'>You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Shall not regreet our fair dominions,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>But tread the stranger paths of banishment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Your will be done: this must my comfort be,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;</span><br/>
<span id='146'>And those his golden beams to you here lent</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Shall point on me and gild my banishment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:</span><br/>
<span id='150'>The sly slow hours shall not determinate</span><br/>
<span id='151'>The dateless limit of thy dear exile;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>The hopeless word of 'never to return'</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>THOMAS MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:</span><br/>
<span id='156'>A dearer merit, not so deep a maim</span><br/>
<span id='157'>As to be cast forth in the common air,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Have I deserved at your highness' hands.</span><br/>
<span id='159'>The language I have learn'd these forty years,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>My native English, now I must forego:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>And now my tongue's use is to me no more</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Than an unstringed viol or a harp,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Or like a cunning instrument cased up,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Or, being open, put into his hands</span><br/>
<span id='165'>That knows no touch to tune the harmony:</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;</span><br/>
<span id='168'>And dull unfeeling barren ignorance</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Is made my gaoler to attend on me.</span><br/>
<span id='170'>I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Too far in years to be a pupil now:</span><br/>
<span id='172'>What is thy sentence then but speechless death,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>It boots thee not to be compassionate:</span><br/>
<span id='175'>After our sentence plaining comes too late.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>THOMAS MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>Then thus I turn me from my country's light,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>Return again, and take an oath with thee.</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Swear by the duty that you owe to God&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Our part therein we banish with yourselves&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='182'>To keep the oath that we administer:</span><br/>
<span id='183'>You never shall, so help you truth and God!</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Embrace each other's love in banishment;</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Nor never look upon each other's face;</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile</span><br/>
<span id='187'>This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Nor never by advised purpose meet</span><br/>
<span id='189'>To plot, contrive, or complot any ill</span><br/>
<span id='190'>'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>I swear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>THOMAS MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>And I, to keep all this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='194'>By this time, had the king permitted us,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>One of our souls had wander'd in the air.</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>As now our flesh is banish'd from this land:</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Since thou hast far to go, bear not along</span><br/>
<span id='200'>The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>THOMAS MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>My name be blotted from the book of life,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!</span><br/>
<span id='204'>But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;</span><br/>
<span id='205'>And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Save back to England, all the world's my way.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes</span><br/>
<span id='209'>I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Hath from the number of his banish'd years</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Pluck'd four away.</span><br/>
<p><em>To HENRY BOLINGBROKE</em></p>
<span id='212'>Six frozen winter spent,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>Return with welcome home from banishment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>How long a time lies in one little word!</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Four lagging winters and four wanton springs</span><br/>
<span id='216'>End in a word: such is the breath of kings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>I thank my liege, that in regard of me</span><br/>
<span id='218'>He shortens four years of my son's exile:</span><br/>
<span id='219'>But little vantage shall I reap thereby;</span><br/>
<span id='220'>For, ere the six years that he hath to spend</span><br/>
<span id='221'>Can change their moons and bring their times about</span><br/>
<span id='222'>My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light</span><br/>
<span id='223'>Shall be extinct with age and endless night;</span><br/>
<span id='224'>My inch of taper will be burnt and done,</span><br/>
<span id='225'>And blindfold death not let me see my son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='226'>Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='227'>But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,</span><br/>
<span id='229'>And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;</span><br/>
<span id='230'>Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,</span><br/>
<span id='231'>But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;</span><br/>
<span id='232'>Thy word is current with him for my death,</span><br/>
<span id='233'>But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='234'>Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:</span><br/>
<span id='236'>Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='237'>Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.</span><br/>
<span id='238'>You urged me as a judge; but I had rather</span><br/>
<span id='239'>You would have bid me argue like a father.</span><br/>
<span id='240'>O, had it been a stranger, not my child,</span><br/>
<span id='241'>To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:</span><br/>
<span id='242'>A partial slander sought I to avoid,</span><br/>
<span id='243'>And in the sentence my own life destroy'd.</span><br/>
<span id='244'>Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,</span><br/>
<span id='245'>I was too strict to make mine own away;</span><br/>
<span id='246'>But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue</span><br/>
<span id='247'>Against my will to do myself this wrong.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='248'>Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='254'>O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,</span><br/>
<span id='255'>That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='256'>I have too few to take my leave of you,</span><br/>
<span id='257'>When the tongue's office should be prodigal</span><br/>
<span id='258'>To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>JOHN OF GAUNT</strong></a>

<span id='259'>Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.</span><br/>

<span id='263'>Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>

<span id='269'>Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make</span><br/>
<span id='270'>Will but remember me what a deal of world</span><br/>
<span id='271'>I wander from the jewels that I love.</span><br/>
<span id='272'>Must I not serve a long apprenticehood</span><br/>
<span id='273'>To foreign passages, and in the end,</span><br/>
<span id='274'>Having my freedom, boast of nothing else</span><br/>
<span id='275'>But that I was a journeyman to grief?</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='276'>All places that the eye of heaven visits</span><br/>
<span id='277'>Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.</span><br/>
<span id='278'>Teach thy necessity to reason thus;</span><br/>
<span id='279'>There is no virtue like necessity.</span><br/>
<span id='280'>Think not the king did banish thee,</span><br/>
<span id='281'>But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,</span><br/>
<span id='282'>Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.</span><br/>
<span id='283'>Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour</span><br/>
<span id='284'>And not the king exiled thee; or suppose</span><br/>
<span id='285'>Devouring pestilence hangs in our air</span><br/>
<span id='286'>And thou art flying to a fresher clime:</span><br/>
<span id='287'>Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it</span><br/>
<span id='288'>To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:</span><br/>
<span id='289'>Suppose the singing birds musicians,</span><br/>
<span id='290'>The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,</span><br/>
<span id='291'>The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more</span><br/>
<span id='292'>Than a delightful measure or a dance;</span><br/>
<span id='293'>For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite</span><br/>
<span id='294'>The man that mocks at it and sets it light.</span><br/>

<span id='295'>O, who can hold a fire in his hand</span><br/>
<span id='296'>By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?</span><br/>
<span id='297'>Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite</span><br/>
<span id='298'>By bare imagination of a feast?</span><br/>
<span id='299'>Or wallow naked in December snow</span><br/>
<span id='300'>By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?</span><br/>
<span id='301'>O, no! the apprehension of the good</span><br/>
<span id='302'>Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:</span><br/>
<span id='303'>Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more</span><br/>
<span id='304'>Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.</span><br/>

<span id='305'>Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:</span><br/>

<span id='307'>Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;</span><br/>
<span id='308'>My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!</span><br/>
<span id='309'>Where'er I wander, boast of this I can,</span><br/>
<span id='310'>Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Henry VIII</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Prologue</h3>

<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I come no more to make you laugh: things now,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>That bear a weighty and a serious brow,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>We now present. Those that can pity, here</span><br/>
<span id='6'>May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>The subject will deserve it. Such as give</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Their money out of hope they may believe,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>May here find truth too. Those that come to see</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Only a show or two, and so agree</span><br/>
<span id='11'>The play may pass, if they be still and willing,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>I'll undertake may see away their shilling</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Richly in two short hours. Only they</span><br/>
<span id='14'>That come to hear a merry bawdy play,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>A noise of targets, or to see a fellow</span><br/>
<span id='16'>In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>To rank our chosen truth with such a show</span><br/>
<span id='19'>As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To make that only true we now intend,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Will leave us never an understanding friend.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known</span><br/>
<span id='24'>The first and happiest hearers of the town,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see</span><br/>
<span id='26'>The very persons of our noble story</span><br/>
<span id='27'>As they were living; think you see them great,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And follow'd with the general throng and sweat</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see</span><br/>
<span id='30'>How soon this mightiness meets misery:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And, if you can be merry then, I'll say</span><br/>
<span id='32'>A man may weep upon his wedding-day.</span><br/>

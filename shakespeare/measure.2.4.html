<h1>Measure for Measure</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>A room in Angelo's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ANGELO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>When I would pray and think, I think and pray</span><br/>
<span id='2'>To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>As if I did but only chew his name;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And in my heart the strong and swelling evil</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Is like a good thing, being often read,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Wherein&mdash;let no man hear me&mdash;I take pride,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Could I with boot change for an idle plume,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls</span><br/>
<span id='15'>To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>'Tis not the devil's crest.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Servant</em></p>
<span id='18'>How now! who's there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Teach her the way.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Servant</em></p>
<span id='21'>O heavens!</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Making both it unable for itself,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And dispossessing all my other parts</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Of necessary fitness?</span><br/>
<span id='26'>So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Come all to help him, and so stop the air</span><br/>
<span id='28'>By which he should revive: and even so</span><br/>
<span id='29'>The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Must needs appear offence.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ISABELLA</em></p>
<span id='33'>How now, fair maid?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>I am come to know your pleasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>That you might know it, would much better please me</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Even so. Heaven keep your honour!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>As long as you or I: yet he must die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Under your sentence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Yea.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted</span><br/>
<span id='44'>That his soul sicken not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good</span><br/>
<span id='46'>To pardon him that hath from nature stolen</span><br/>
<span id='47'>A man already made, as to remit</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image</span><br/>
<span id='49'>In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Falsely to take away a life true made</span><br/>
<span id='51'>As to put metal in restrained means</span><br/>
<span id='52'>To make a false one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Which had you rather, that the most just law</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness</span><br/>
<span id='58'>As she that he hath stain'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Sir, believe this,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>I had rather give my body than my soul.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Stand more for number than for accompt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>How say you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Against the thing I say. Answer to this:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>I, now the voice of the recorded law,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Might there not be a charity in sin</span><br/>
<span id='69'>To save this brother's life?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Please you to do't,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>I'll take it as a peril to my soul,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>It is no sin at all, but charity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Were equal poise of sin and charity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>That I do beg his life, if it be sin,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer</span><br/>
<span id='78'>To have it added to the faults of mine,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>And nothing of your answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Nay, but hear me.</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>But graciously to know I am no better.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright</span><br/>
<span id='86'>When it doth tax itself; as these black masks</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Your brother is to die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>So.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>And his offence is so, as it appears,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Accountant to the law upon that pain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>True.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Admit no other way to save his life,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>As I subscribe not that, nor any other,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>But in the loss of question,&mdash;that you, his sister,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Finding yourself desired of such a person,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Could fetch your brother from the manacles</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Of the all-building law; and that there were</span><br/>
<span id='102'>No earthly mean to save him, but that either</span><br/>
<span id='103'>You must lay down the treasures of your body</span><br/>
<span id='104'>To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;</span><br/>
<span id='105'>What would you do?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>As much for my poor brother as myself:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>That is, were I under the terms of death,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And strip myself to death, as to a bed</span><br/>
<span id='110'>That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield</span><br/>
<span id='111'>My body up to shame.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Then must your brother die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>And 'twere the cheaper way:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Better it were a brother died at once,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Than that a sister, by redeeming him,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Should die for ever.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Were not you then as cruel as the sentence</span><br/>
<span id='118'>That you have slander'd so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Ignominy in ransom and free pardon</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Are of two houses: lawful mercy</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Is nothing kin to foul redemption.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>And rather proved the sliding of your brother</span><br/>
<span id='124'>A merriment than a vice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:</span><br/>
<span id='127'>I something do excuse the thing I hate,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>For his advantage that I dearly love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>We are all frail.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>                  Else let my brother die,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>If not a feodary, but only he</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Owe and succeed thy weakness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Nay, women are frail too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Which are as easy broke as they make forms.</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar</span><br/>
<span id='137'>In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;</span><br/>
<span id='138'>For we are soft as our complexions are,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>And credulous to false prints.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>I think it well:</span><br/>
<span id='141'>And from this testimony of your own sex,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Than faults may shake our frames,&mdash;let me be bold;</span><br/>
<span id='144'>I do arrest your words. Be that you are,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;</span><br/>
<span id='146'>If you be one, as you are well express'd</span><br/>
<span id='147'>By all external warrants, show it now,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>By putting on the destined livery.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Let me entreat you speak the former language.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Plainly conceive, I love you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>My brother did love Juliet,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>And you tell me that he shall die for it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>I know your virtue hath a licence in't,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Which seems a little fouler than it is,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>To pluck on others.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>Believe me, on mine honour,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>My words express my purpose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Ha! little honour to be much believed,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!</span><br/>
<span id='162'>I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Sign me a present pardon for my brother,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud</span><br/>
<span id='165'>What man thou art.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>                  Who will believe thee, Isabel?</span><br/>
<span id='167'>My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Will so your accusation overweigh,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>That you shall stifle in your own report</span><br/>
<span id='171'>And smell of calumny. I have begun,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And now I give my sensual race the rein:</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother</span><br/>
<span id='176'>By yielding up thy body to my will;</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Or else he must not only die the death,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>But thy unkindness shall his death draw out</span><br/>
<span id='179'>To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Or, by the affection that now guides me most,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>ISABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Either of condemnation or approof;</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.</span><br/>
<span id='192'>That, had he twenty heads to tender down</span><br/>
<span id='193'>On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Before his sister should her body stoop</span><br/>
<span id='195'>To such abhorr'd pollution.</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:</span><br/>
<span id='197'>More than our brother is our chastity.</span><br/>
<span id='198'>I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

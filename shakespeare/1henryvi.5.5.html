<blockquote>
<em>Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER and EXETER</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Her virtues graced with external gifts</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>So am I driven by breath of her renown</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Where I may have fruition of her love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Is but a preface of her worthy praise;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The chief perfections of that lovely dame</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Had I sufficient skill to utter them,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Would make a volume of enticing lines,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Able to ravish any dull conceit:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And, which is more, she is not so divine,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>So full-replete with choice of all delights,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>But with as humble lowliness of mind</span><br/>
<span id='19'>She is content to be at your command;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To love and honour Henry as her lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Therefore, my lord protector, give consent</span><br/>
<span id='24'>That Margaret may be England's royal queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>So should I give consent to flatter sin.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Unto another lady of esteem:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>How shall we then dispense with that contract,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And not deface your honour with reproach?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd</span><br/>
<span id='32'>To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists</span><br/>
<span id='33'>By reason of his adversary's odds:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And therefore may be broke without offence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Her father is no better than an earl,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Although in glorious titles he excel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Yes, lord, her father is a king,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>The King of Naples and Jerusalem;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And of such great authority in France</span><br/>
<span id='42'>As his alliance will confirm our peace</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>That he should be so abject, base and poor,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Henry is able to enrich his queen</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And not seek a queen to make him rich:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Marriage is a matter of more worth</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Must be companion of his nuptial bed:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>It most of all these reasons bindeth us,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>In our opinions she should be preferr'd.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>For what is wedlock forced but a hell,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>An age of discord and continual strife?</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And is a pattern of celestial peace.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Approves her fit for none but for a king:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>More than in women commonly is seen,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Will answer our hope in issue of a king;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>For Henry, son unto a conqueror,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Is likely to beget more conquerors,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>If with a lady of so high resolve</span><br/>
<span id='76'>As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me</span><br/>
<span id='78'>That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Whether it be through force of your report,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that</span><br/>
<span id='81'>My tender youth was never yet attaint</span><br/>
<span id='82'>With any passion of inflaming love,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>I cannot tell; but this I am assured,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>As I am sick with working of my thoughts.</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Agree to any covenants, and procure</span><br/>
<span id='89'>That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come</span><br/>
<span id='90'>To cross the seas to England and be crown'd</span><br/>
<span id='91'>King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>For your expenses and sufficient charge,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Among the people gather up a tenth.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And you, good uncle, banish all offence:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>If you do censure me by what you were,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Not what you are, I know it will excuse</span><br/>
<span id='99'>This sudden execution of my will.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And so, conduct me where, from company,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>I may revolve and ruminate my grief.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SUFFOLK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>With hope to find the like event in love,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>But prosper better than the Trojan did.</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>But I will rule both her, the king and realm.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

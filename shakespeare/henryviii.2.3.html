<blockquote>
<em>Enter ANNE and an Old Lady</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Not for that neither: here's the pang that pinches:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>His highness having lived so long with her, and she</span><br/>
<span id='3'>So good a lady that no tongue could ever</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Pronounce dishonour of her; by my life,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>She never knew harm-doing: O, now, after</span><br/>
<span id='6'>So many courses of the sun enthroned,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which</span><br/>
<span id='8'>To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than</span><br/>
<span id='9'>'Tis sweet at first to acquire,&mdash;after this process,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To give her the avaunt! it is a pity</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Would move a monster.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Old Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Hearts of most hard temper</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Melt and lament for her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>O, God's will! much better</span><br/>
<span id='15'>She ne'er had known pomp: though't be temporal,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce</span><br/>
<span id='17'>It from the bearer, 'tis a sufferance panging</span><br/>
<span id='18'>As soul and body's severing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Old Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Alas, poor lady!</span><br/>
<span id='20'>She's a stranger now again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>So much the more</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Must pity drop upon her. Verily,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And range with humble livers in content,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And wear a golden sorrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Old Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Our content</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Is our best having.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>By my troth and maidenhead,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>I would not be a queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Old Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Beshrew me, I would,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And venture maidenhead for't; and so would you,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>For all this spice of your hypocrisy:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>You, that have so fair parts of woman on you,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Have too a woman's heart; which ever yet</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Which, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Saving your mincing, the capacity</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>If you might please to stretch it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Nay, good troth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Old Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Yes, troth, and troth; you would not be a queen?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>No, not for all the riches under heaven.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Old Lady:	'Tis strange: a three-pence bow'd would hire me,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Old as I am, to queen it: but, I pray you,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>What think you of a duchess? have you limbs</span><br/>
<span id='47'>To bear that load of title?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>No, in truth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Old Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Then you are weakly made: pluck off a little;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>I would not be a young count in your way,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>For more than blushing comes to: if your back</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Cannot vouchsafe this burthen,'tis too weak</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Ever to get a boy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>                  How you do talk!</span><br/>
<span id='55'>I swear again, I would not be a queen</span><br/>
<span id='56'>For all the world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Old Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>                  In faith, for little England</span><br/>
<span id='58'>You'ld venture an emballing: I myself</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Would for Carnarvonshire, although there long'd</span><br/>
<span id='60'>No more to the crown but that. Lo, who comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Chamberlain</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Good morrow, ladies. What were't worth to know</span><br/>
<span id='62'>The secret of your conference?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>My good lord,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Not your demand; it values not your asking:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>It was a gentle business, and becoming</span><br/>
<span id='67'>The action of good women: there is hope</span><br/>
<span id='68'>All will be well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>                  Now, I pray God, amen!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>You bear a gentle mind, and heavenly blessings</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Follow such creatures. That you may, fair lady,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note's</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Ta'en of your many virtues, the king's majesty</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Commends his good opinion of you, and</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Does purpose honour to you no less flowing</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Than Marchioness of Pembroke: to which title</span><br/>
<span id='77'>A thousand pound a year, annual support,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Out of his grace he adds.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>I do not know</span><br/>
<span id='80'>What kind of my obedience I should tender;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>More than my all is nothing: nor my prayers</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Are not words duly hallow'd, nor my wishes</span><br/>
<span id='83'>More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>As from a blushing handmaid, to his highness;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Whose health and royalty I pray for.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Lady,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>I shall not fail to approve the fair conceit</span><br/>
<span id='90'>The king hath of you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='91'>I have perused her well;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Beauty and honour in her are so mingled</span><br/>
<span id='93'>That they have caught the king: and who knows yet</span><br/>
<span id='94'>But from this lady may proceed a gem</span><br/>
<span id='95'>To lighten all this isle? I'll to the king,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And say I spoke with you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Chamberlain</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>My honour'd lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Old Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Why, this it is; see, see!</span><br/>
<span id='99'>I have been begging sixteen years in court,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Am yet a courtier beggarly, nor could</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Come pat betwixt too early and too late</span><br/>
<span id='102'>For any suit of pounds; and you, O fate!</span><br/>
<span id='103'>A very fresh-fish here&mdash;fie, fie, fie upon</span><br/>
<span id='104'>This compell'd fortune!&mdash;have your mouth fill'd up</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Before you open it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>This is strange to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Old Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>How tastes it? is it bitter? forty pence, no.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>There was a lady once, 'tis an old story,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>That would not be a queen, that would she not,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>For all the mud in Egypt: have you heard it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Come, you are pleasant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Old Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>With your theme, I could</span><br/>
<span id='113'>O'ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke!</span><br/>
<span id='114'>A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!</span><br/>
<span id='115'>No other obligation! By my life,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>That promises moe thousands: honour's train</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time</span><br/>
<span id='118'>I know your back will bear a duchess: say,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Are you not stronger than you were?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Good lady,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And leave me out on't. Would I had no being,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>If this salute my blood a jot: it faints me,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>To think what follows.</span><br/>
<span id='125'>The queen is comfortless, and we forgetful</span><br/>
<span id='126'>In our long absence: pray, do not deliver</span><br/>
<span id='127'>What here you've heard to her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Old Lady</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>What do you think me?</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Othello</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MONTANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>What from the cape can you discern at sea?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Descry a sail.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MONTANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>A segregation of the Turkish fleet:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>For do but stand upon the foaming shore,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Seems to cast water on the burning bear,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>I never did like molestation view</span><br/>
<span id='17'>On the enchafed flood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MONTANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>If that the Turkish fleet</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:</span><br/>
<span id='20'>It is impossible they bear it out.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a third Gentleman</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>News, lads! our wars are done.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance</span><br/>
<span id='25'>On most part of their fleet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MONTANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>How! is this true?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>The ship is here put in,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And is in full commission here for Cyprus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MONTANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted</span><br/>
<span id='36'>With foul and violent tempest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MONTANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Pray heavens he be;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>For I have served him, and the man commands</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!</span><br/>
<span id='40'>As well to see the vessel that's come in</span><br/>
<span id='41'>As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Even till we make the main and the aerial blue</span><br/>
<span id='43'>An indistinct regard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Third Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Come, let's do so:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>For every minute is expectancy</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Of more arrivance.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CASSIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Give him defence against the elements,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MONTANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Is he well shipp'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Of very expert and approved allowance;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Stand in bold cure.</span><br/>
<p><em>A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!'</em></p>
<p><em>Enter a fourth Gentleman</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>What noise?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Fourth Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>My hopes do shape him for the governor.</span><br/>
<p><em>Guns heard</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Second Gentlemen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>They do discharge their shot of courtesy:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Our friends at least.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I pray you, sir, go forth,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>I shall.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>MONTANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid</span><br/>
<span id='67'>That paragons description and wild fame;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And in the essential vesture of creation</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Does tire the ingener.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter second Gentleman</em></p>
<span id='71'>How now! who has put in?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Has had most favourable and happy speed:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>As having sense of beauty, do omit</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Their mortal natures, letting go safely by</span><br/>
<span id='79'>The divine Desdemona.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>MONTANO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>What is she?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='84'>A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And bring all Cyprus comfort!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Attendants</em></p>
<span id='90'>O, behold,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>The riches of the ship is come on shore!</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Before, behind thee, and on every hand,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Enwheel thee round!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>I thank you, valiant Cassio.</span><br/>
<span id='97'>What tidings can you tell me of my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught</span><br/>
<span id='99'>But that he's well and will be shortly here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>O, but I fear&mdash;How lost you company?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>The great contention of the sea and skies</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Parted our fellowship&mdash;But, hark! a sail.</span><br/>
<p><em>Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>They give their greeting to the citadel;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>This likewise is a friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>See for the news.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Gentleman</em></p>
<span id='106'>Good ancient, you are welcome.</span><br/>
<p><em>To EMILIA</em></p>
<span id='107'>Welcome, mistress.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding</span><br/>
<span id='110'>That gives me this bold show of courtesy.</span><br/>
<p><em>Kissing her</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Sir, would she give you so much of her lips</span><br/>
<span id='112'>As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>You'll have enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Alas, she has no speech.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>In faith, too much;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>I find it still, when I have list to sleep:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>She puts her tongue a little in her heart,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And chides with thinking.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>You have little cause to say so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Saints in your injuries, devils being offended,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>O, fie upon thee, slanderer!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:</span><br/>
<span id='127'>You rise to play and go to bed to work.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>You shall not write my praise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>No, let me not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst</span><br/>
<span id='131'>praise me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>O gentle lady, do not put me to't;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>For I am nothing, if not critical.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Ay, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>I am not merry; but I do beguile</span><br/>
<span id='137'>The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Come, how wouldst thou praise me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>I am about it; but indeed my invention</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>And thus she is deliver'd.</span><br/>
<span id='143'>If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>The one's for use, the other useth it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Well praised! How if she be black and witty?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>If she be black, and thereto have a wit,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Worse and worse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>EMILIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>How if fair and foolish?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>She never yet was foolish that was fair;</span><br/>
<span id='151'>For even her folly help'd her to an heir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'</span><br/>
<span id='153'>the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for</span><br/>
<span id='154'>her that's foul and foolish?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.</span><br/>
<span id='158'>But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving</span><br/>
<span id='159'>woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her</span><br/>
<span id='160'>merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>She that was ever fair and never proud,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'</span><br/>
<span id='165'>She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>She that in wisdom never was so frail</span><br/>
<span id='168'>To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>See suitors following and not look behind,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>She was a wight, if ever such wight were,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>To do what?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn</span><br/>
<span id='175'>of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say</span><br/>
<span id='176'>you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal</span><br/>
<span id='177'>counsellor?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more in</span><br/>
<span id='179'>the soldier than in the scholar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>[Aside]  He takes her by the palm: ay, well said,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>whisper: with as little a web as this will I</span><br/>
<span id='182'>ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon</span><br/>
<span id='183'>her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.</span><br/>
<span id='184'>You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as</span><br/>
<span id='185'>these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had</span><br/>
<span id='186'>been better you had not kissed your three fingers so</span><br/>
<span id='187'>oft, which now again you are most apt to play the</span><br/>
<span id='188'>sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent</span><br/>
<span id='189'>courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers</span><br/>
<span id='190'>to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!</span><br/>
<p><em>Trumpet within</em></p>
<span id='191'>The Moor! I know his trumpet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>'Tis truly so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>Let's meet him and receive him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>CASSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>Lo, where he comes!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter OTHELLO and Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>O my fair warrior!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>                  My dear Othello!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>It gives me wonder great as my content</span><br/>
<span id='198'>To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!</span><br/>
<span id='199'>If after every tempest come such calms,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!</span><br/>
<span id='201'>And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Olympus-high and duck again as low</span><br/>
<span id='203'>As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>My soul hath her content so absolute</span><br/>
<span id='206'>That not another comfort like to this</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>DESDEMONA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>The heavens forbid</span><br/>

<span id='211'>Amen to that, sweet powers!</span><br/>
<span id='212'>I cannot speak enough of this content;</span><br/>

<span id='217'>But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,</span><br/>
<span id='218'>As honest as I am.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>OTHELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='219'>                  Come, let us to the castle.</span><br/>
<span id='220'>News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks</span><br/>

<span id='222'>How does my old acquaintance of this isle?</span><br/>
<span id='223'>Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;</span><br/>
<span id='224'>I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,</span><br/>

<span id='speech74'><strong>RODERIGO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='239'>With him! why, 'tis not possible.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>IAGO</strong></span>

<span id='240'>Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.</span><br/>
<span id='241'>Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,</span><br/>

<span id='243'>and will she love him still for prating? let not</span><br/>
<span id='244'>thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;</span><br/>
<span id='245'>and what delight shall she have to look on the</span><br/>
<span id='246'>devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of</span><br/>
<span id='247'>sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to</span><br/>
<span id='248'>give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,</span><br/>
<span id='249'>sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which</span><br/>
<span id='250'>the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these</span><br/>
<span id='251'>required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will</span><br/>
<span id='252'>find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,</span><br/>
<span id='253'>disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will</span><br/>
<span id='254'>instruct her in it and compel her to some second</span><br/>
<span id='255'>choice. Now, sir, this granted,&mdash;as it is a most</span><br/>
<span id='256'>pregnant and unforced position&mdash;who stands so</span><br/>
<span id='257'>eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio</span><br/>
<span id='258'>does? a knave very voluble; no further</span><br/>
<span id='259'>conscionable than in putting on the mere form of</span><br/>
<span id='260'>civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing</span><br/>
<span id='261'>of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,</span><br/>
<span id='262'>none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a</span><br/>
<span id='263'>finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and</span><br/>
<span id='264'>counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never</span><br/>
<span id='265'>present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the</span><br/>
<span id='266'>knave is handsome, young, and hath all those</span><br/>
<span id='267'>requisites in him that folly and green minds look</span><br/>
<span id='268'>after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman</span><br/>
<span id='269'>hath found him already.</span><br/>

<span id='272'>Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of</span><br/>

<span id='278'>Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue</span><br/>
<span id='279'>to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met</span><br/>
<span id='280'>so near with their lips that their breaths embraced</span><br/>
<span id='281'>together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these</span><br/>
<span id='282'>mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes</span><br/>
<span id='283'>the master and main exercise, the incorporate</span><br/>

<span id='285'>have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;</span><br/>
<span id='286'>for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows</span><br/>
<span id='287'>you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find</span><br/>
<span id='288'>some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking</span><br/>
<span id='289'>too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what</span><br/>
<span id='290'>other course you please, which the time shall more</span><br/>

<span id='295'>even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to</span><br/>
<span id='296'>mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true</span><br/>

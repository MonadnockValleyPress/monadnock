<h4>Another part of the platform.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GHOST and HAMLET</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Ghost</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Mark me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>       I will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Ghost</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>                  My hour is almost come,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Must render up myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Alas, poor ghost!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Ghost</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing</span><br/>
<span id='9'>To what I shall unfold.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Speak; I am bound to hear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Ghost</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'> So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>What?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Ghost</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>I am thy father's spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And for the day confined to fast in fires,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid</span><br/>
<span id='18'>To tell the secrets of my prison-house,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I could a tale unfold whose lightest word</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Thy knotted and combined locks to part</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And each particular hair to stand on end,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>But this eternal blazon must not be</span><br/>
<span id='26'>To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!</span><br/>
<span id='27'>If thou didst ever thy dear father love&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>O God!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Ghost</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Murder!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Ghost</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Murder most foul, as in the best it is;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>But this most foul, strange and unnatural.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift</span><br/>
<span id='34'>As meditation or the thoughts of love,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>May sweep to my revenge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Ghost</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>I find thee apt;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed</span><br/>
<span id='38'>That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Is by a forged process of my death</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>The serpent that did sting thy father's life</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Now wears his crown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>O my prophetic soul! My uncle!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Ghost</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power</span><br/>
<span id='50'>So to seduce!&mdash;won to his shameful lust</span><br/>
<span id='51'>The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!</span><br/>
<span id='53'>From me, whose love was of that dignity</span><br/>
<span id='54'>That it went hand in hand even with the vow</span><br/>
<span id='55'>I made to her in marriage, and to decline</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor</span><br/>
<span id='57'>To those of mine!</span><br/>
<span id='58'>But virtue, as it never will be moved,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Will sate itself in a celestial bed,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And prey on garbage.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>My custom always of the afternoon,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And in the porches of my ears did pour</span><br/>
<span id='69'>The leperous distilment; whose effect</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Holds such an enmity with blood of man</span><br/>
<span id='71'>That swift as quicksilver it courses through</span><br/>
<span id='72'>The natural gates and alleys of the body,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And with a sudden vigour doth posset</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And curd, like eager droppings into milk,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And a most instant tetter bark'd about,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>All my smooth body.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>No reckoning made, but sent to my account</span><br/>
<span id='84'>With all my imperfections on my head:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!</span><br/>
<span id='86'>If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Let not the royal bed of Denmark be</span><br/>
<span id='88'>A couch for luxury and damned incest.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!</span><br/>
<span id='94'>The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat</span><br/>
<span id='102'>In this distracted globe. Remember thee!</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Yea, from the table of my memory</span><br/>
<span id='104'>I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>That youth and observation copied there;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And thy commandment all alone shall live</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Within the book and volume of my brain,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!</span><br/>
<span id='110'>O most pernicious woman!</span><br/>
<span id='111'>O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!</span><br/>
<span id='112'>My tables,&mdash;meet it is I set it down,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:</span><br/>
<p><em>Writing</em></p>
<span id='115'>So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'</span><br/>
<span id='117'>I have sworn't.</span><br/>

<span id='149'>Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,</span><br/>

<span id='187'>Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>As I perchance hereafter shall think meet</span><br/>
<span id='190'>To put an antic disposition on,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'</span><br/>

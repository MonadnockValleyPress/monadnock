<h1>King Lear</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The French camp near Dover.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KENT and a Gentleman</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back</span><br/>
<span id='2'>know you the reason?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Something he left imperfect in the</span><br/>
<span id='4'>state, which since his coming forth is thought</span><br/>
<span id='5'>of; which imports to the kingdom so much</span><br/>
<span id='6'>fear and danger, that his personal return was</span><br/>
<span id='7'>most required and necessary.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Who hath he left behind him general?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Did your letters pierce the queen to any</span><br/>
<span id='11'>demonstration of grief?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And now and then an ample tear trill'd down</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Sought to be king o'er her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>O, then it moved her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Who should express her goodliest. You have seen</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Were like a better way: those happy smilets,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know</span><br/>
<span id='23'>What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>If all could so become it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Made she no verbal question?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Let pity not be believed!' There she shook</span><br/>
<span id='33'>The holy water from her heavenly eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And clamour moisten'd: then away she started</span><br/>
<span id='35'>To deal with grief alone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>It is the stars,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>The stars above us, govern our conditions;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Else one self mate and mate could not beget</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>No.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Was this before the king return'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>No, since.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers</span><br/>
<span id='45'>What we are come about, and by no means</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Will yield to see his daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Why, good sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her</span><br/>
<span id='50'>To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights</span><br/>
<span id='51'>To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting</span><br/>
<span id='52'>His mind so venomously, that burning shame</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Detains him from Cordelia.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Alack, poor gentleman!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>'Tis so, they are afoot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And leave you to attend him: some dear cause</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>When I am known aright, you shall not grieve</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Along with me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter BERTRAM and DIANA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>They told me that your name was Fontibell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>No, my good lord, Diana.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Titled goddess;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>In your fine frame hath love no quality?</span><br/>
<span id='6'>If quick fire of youth light not your mind,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>You are no maiden, but a monument:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>When you are dead, you should be such a one</span><br/>
<span id='9'>As you are now, for you are cold and stem;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And now you should be as your mother was</span><br/>
<span id='11'>When your sweet self was got.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>She then was honest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>So should you be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>No:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>My mother did but duty; such, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>As you owe to your wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>No more o' that;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>I prithee, do not strive against my vows:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I was compell'd to her; but I love thee</span><br/>
<span id='20'>By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Do thee all rights of service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Ay, so you serve us</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And mock us with our bareness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>How have I sworn!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>What is not holy, that we swear not by,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>If I should swear by God's great attributes,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>When I did love you ill? This has no holding,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>To swear by him whom I protest to love,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>That I will work against him: therefore your oaths</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>At least in my opinion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Change it, change it;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts</span><br/>
<span id='41'>That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>But give thyself unto my sick desires,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever</span><br/>
<span id='44'>My love as it begins shall so persever.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>I see that men make ropes in such a scarre</span><br/>
<span id='46'>That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>I'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power</span><br/>
<span id='48'>To give it from me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Will you not, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>It is an honour 'longing to our house,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Bequeathed down from many ancestors;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world</span><br/>
<span id='53'>In me to lose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>                  Mine honour's such a ring:</span><br/>
<span id='55'>My chastity's the jewel of our house,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Bequeathed down from many ancestors;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world</span><br/>
<span id='58'>In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Brings in the champion Honour on my part,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Against your vain assault.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Here, take my ring:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And I'll be bid by thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>I'll order take my mother shall not hear.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Now will I charge you in the band of truth,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them</span><br/>
<span id='70'>When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And on your finger in the night I'll put</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Another ring, that what in time proceeds</span><br/>
<span id='73'>May token to the future our past deeds.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won</span><br/>
<span id='75'>A wife of me, though there my hope be done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>For which live long to thank both heaven and me!</span><br/>
<span id='78'>You may so in the end.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>My mother told me just how he would woo,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>As if she sat in 's heart; she says all men</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me</span><br/>
<span id='82'>When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him</span><br/>
<span id='83'>When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Marry that will, I live and die a maid:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Only in this disguise I think't no sin</span><br/>
<span id='86'>To cozen him that would unjustly win.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

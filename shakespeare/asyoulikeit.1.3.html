<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</H3>
<h4>A room in the palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CELIA and ROSALIND</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Not one to throw at a dog.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon</span><br/>
<span id='4'>curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one</span><br/>
<span id='6'>should be lamed with reasons and the other mad</span><br/>
<span id='7'>without any.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>But is all this for your father?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how</span><br/>
<span id='10'>full of briers is this working-day world!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in</span><br/>
<span id='12'>holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden</span><br/>
<span id='13'>paths our very petticoats will catch them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Hem them away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in</span><br/>
<span id='20'>despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of</span><br/>
<span id='21'>service, let us talk in good earnest: is it</span><br/>
<span id='22'>possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so</span><br/>
<span id='23'>strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>The duke my father loved his father dearly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son</span><br/>
<span id='26'>dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate</span><br/>
<span id='28'>not Orlando.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Let me love him for that, and do you love him</span><br/>
<span id='32'>because I do. Look, here comes the duke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>With his eyes full of anger.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DUKE FREDERICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And get you from our court.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Me, uncle?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DUKE FREDERICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>You, cousin</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Within these ten days if that thou be'st found</span><br/>
<span id='39'>So near our public court as twenty miles,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Thou diest for it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>                  I do beseech your grace,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>If with myself I hold intelligence</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>If that I do not dream or be not frantic,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>As I do trust I am not&mdash;then, dear uncle,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Never so much as in a thought unborn</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Did I offend your highness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DUKE FREDERICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Thus do all traitors:</span><br/>
<span id='50'>If their purgation did consist in words,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>They are as innocent as grace itself:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DUKE FREDERICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>So was I when your highness took his dukedom;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>So was I when your highness banish'd him:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Treason is not inherited, my lord;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Or, if we did derive it from our friends,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>What's that to me? my father was no traitor:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much</span><br/>
<span id='62'>To think my poverty is treacherous.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Dear sovereign, hear me speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DUKE FREDERICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Else had she with her father ranged along.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>I did not then entreat to have her stay;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>It was your pleasure and your own remorse:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>I was too young that time to value her;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>But now I know her: if she be a traitor,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Why so am I; we still have slept together,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Still we went coupled and inseparable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>DUKE FREDERICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Her very silence and her patience</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Speak to the people, and they pity her.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous</span><br/>
<span id='79'>When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Firm and irrevocable is my doom</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>I cannot live out of her company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>DUKE FREDERICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And in the greatness of my word, you die.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>I have more cause.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>                  Thou hast not, cousin;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Hath banish'd me, his daughter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>That he hath not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?</span><br/>
<span id='98'>No: let my father seek another heir.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Therefore devise with me how we may fly,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Whither to go and what to bear with us;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And do not seek to take your change upon you,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Why, whither shall we go?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Alas, what danger will it be to us,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>I'll put myself in poor and mean attire</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And with a kind of umber smirch my face;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>The like do you: so shall we pass along</span><br/>
<span id='113'>And never stir assailants.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Were it not better,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Because that I am more than common tall,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>That I did suit me all points like a man?</span><br/>
<span id='117'>A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>A boar-spear in my hand; and&mdash;in my heart</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='120'>We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>As many other mannish cowards have</span><br/>
<span id='122'>That do outface it with their semblances.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>What shall I call thee when thou art a man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And therefore look you call me Ganymede.</span><br/>
<span id='126'>But what will you be call'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Something that hath a reference to my state</span><br/>
<span id='128'>No longer Celia, but Aliena.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ROSALIND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal</span><br/>
<span id='130'>The clownish fool out of your father's court?</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Would he not be a comfort to our travel?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CELIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And get our jewels and our wealth together,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Devise the fittest time and safest way</span><br/>
<span id='136'>To hide us from pursuit that will be made</span><br/>
<span id='137'>After my flight. Now go we in content</span><br/>
<span id='138'>To liberty and not to banishment.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

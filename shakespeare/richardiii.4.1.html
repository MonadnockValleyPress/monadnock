<blockquote>
<em>Enter, on one side, QUEEN ELIZABETH, DUCHESS OF  YORK, and DORSET; on the other, ANNE, Duchess of  Gloucester, leading Lady Margaret Plantagenet, CLARENCE's young Daughter</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Who m eets us here?  my niece Plantagenet</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Daughter, well met.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>God give your graces both</span><br/>
<span id='7'>A happy and a joyful time of day!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>As much to you, good sister! Whither away?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Upon the like devotion as yourselves,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To gratulate the gentle princes there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BRAKENBURY</em></p>
<span id='13'>And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>How doth the prince, and my young son of York?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BRAKENBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Right well, dear madam. By your patience,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>I may not suffer you to visit them;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>The king hath straitly charged the contrary.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>The king! why, who's that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BRAKENBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>The Lord protect him from that kingly title!</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?</span><br/>
<span id='23'>I am their mother; who should keep me from them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>I am their fathers mother; I will see them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And take thy office from thee, on my peril.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BRAKENBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter LORD STANLEY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LORD STANLEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.</span><br/>
<p><em>To LADY ANNE</em></p>
<span id='33'>Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart</span><br/>
<span id='36'>May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon</span><br/>
<span id='37'>With this dead-killing news!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DORSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Thy mother's name is ominous to children.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Lest thou increase the number of the dead;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LORD STANLEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Take all the swift advantage of the hours;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>You shall have letters from me to my son</span><br/>
<span id='52'>To meet you on the way, and welcome you.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>O ill-dispersing wind of misery!</span><br/>
<span id='55'>O my accursed womb, the bed of death!</span><br/>
<span id='56'>A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Whose unavoided eye is murderous.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LORD STANLEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>And I in all unwillingness will go.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>I would to God that the inclusive verge</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Of golden metal that must round my brow</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Anointed let me be with deadly venom,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory</span><br/>
<span id='66'>To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>No! why?  When he that is my husband now</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Which issued from my other angel husband</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>For making me, so young, so old a widow!</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And be thy wife&mdash;if any be so mad&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>As miserable by the life of thee</span><br/>
<span id='78'>As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Even in so short a space, my woman's heart</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Grossly grew captive to his honey words</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>For never yet one hour in his bed</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>But have been waked by his timorous dreams.</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LADY ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DUCHESS OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>[To DORSET]</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee!</span><br/>
<p><em>To LADY ANNE</em></p>
<span id='95'>Go thou to Richard, and good angels guard thee!</span><br/>
<p><em>To QUEEN ELIZABETH</em></p>
<span id='96'>Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!</span><br/>
<span id='97'>I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Whom envy hath immured within your walls!</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow</span><br/>
<span id='105'>For tender princes, use my babies well!</span><br/>
<span id='106'>So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

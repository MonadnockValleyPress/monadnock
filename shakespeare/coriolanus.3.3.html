<h1>Coriolanus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The same. The Forum.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>In this point charge him home, that he affects</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Enforce him with his envy to the people,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And that the spoil got on the Antiates</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Was ne'er distributed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter an AEdile</em></p>
<span id='6'>What, will he come?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>AEdile</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>He's coming.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>How accompanied?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>AEdile</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>With old Menenius, and those senators</span><br/>
<span id='10'>That always favour'd him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Have you a catalogue</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Of all the voices that we have procured</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Set down by the poll?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>AEdile</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>I have; 'tis ready.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Have you collected them by tribes?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>AEdile</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>I have.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Assemble presently the people hither;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And when they bear me say 'It shall be so</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either</span><br/>
<span id='20'>For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them</span><br/>
<span id='21'>If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Insisting on the old prerogative</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And power i' the truth o' the cause.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>AEdile</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>I shall inform them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>And when such time they have begun to cry,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Let them not cease, but with a din confused</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Enforce the present execution</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Of what we chance to sentence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>AEdile</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Very well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Make them be strong and ready for this hint,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>When we shall hap to give 't them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Go about it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit AEdile</em></p>
<span id='33'>Put him to choler straight: he hath been used</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Ever to conquer, and to have his worth</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks</span><br/>
<span id='37'>What's in his heart; and that is there which looks</span><br/>
<span id='38'>With us to break his neck.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Well, here he comes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, and COMINIUS, with Senators and Patricians</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Calmly, I do beseech you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And not our streets with war!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>First Senator</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Amen, amen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>A noble wish.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter AEdile, with Citizens</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Draw near, ye people.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>AEdile</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>First, hear me speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Both Tribunes</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Well, say. Peace, ho!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Shall I be charged no further than this present?</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Must all determine here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>I do demand,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>If you submit you to the people's voices,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Allow their officers and are content</span><br/>
<span id='58'>To suffer lawful censure for such faults</span><br/>
<span id='59'>As shall be proved upon you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>I am content.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Lo, citizens, he says he is content:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>The warlike service he has done, consider; think</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Upon the wounds his body bears, which show</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Like graves i' the holy churchyard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Scratches with briers,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Scars to move laughter only.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Consider further,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>That when he speaks not like a citizen,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>You find him like a soldier: do not take</span><br/>
<span id='70'>His rougher accents for malicious sounds,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>But, as I say, such as become a soldier,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Rather than envy you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Well, well, no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>What is the matter</span><br/>
<span id='75'>That being pass'd for consul with full voice,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>I am so dishonour'd that the very hour</span><br/>
<span id='77'>You take it off again?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Answer to us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>We charge you, that you have contrived to take</span><br/>
<span id='81'>From Rome all season'd office and to wind</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Yourself into a power tyrannical;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>For which you are a traitor to the people.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>How! traitor!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>                  Nay, temperately; your promise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say</span><br/>
<span id='91'>'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free</span><br/>
<span id='92'>As I do pray the gods.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Mark you this, people?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>Citizens</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>To the rock, to the rock with him!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Peace!</span><br/>
<span id='96'>We need not put new matter to his charge:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>What you have seen him do and heard him speak,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Opposing laws with strokes and here defying</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Those whose great power must try him; even this,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>So criminal and in such capital kind,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Deserves the extremest death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>But since he hath</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Served well for Rome,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>What do you prate of service?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>I talk of that, that know it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>You?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Is this the promise that you made your mother?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Know, I pray you,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>I know no further:</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger</span><br/>
<span id='113'>But with a grain a day, I would not buy</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Their mercy at the price of one fair word;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>For that he has,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>As much as in him lies, from time to time</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Envied against the people, seeking means</span><br/>
<span id='120'>To pluck away their power, as now at last</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers</span><br/>
<span id='123'>That do distribute it; in the name o' the people</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And in the power of us the tribunes, we,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Even from this instant, banish him our city,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>In peril of precipitation</span><br/>
<span id='127'>From off the rock Tarpeian never more</span><br/>
<span id='128'>To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>I say it shall be so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Citizens</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>He's banish'd, and it shall be so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>He's sentenced; no more hearing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>COMINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Let me speak:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>I have been consul, and can show for Rome</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love</span><br/>
<span id='137'>My country's good with a respect more tender,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>More holy and profound, than mine own life,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>And treasure of my loins; then if I would</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Speak that,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>                  We know your drift: speak what?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>As enemy to the people and his country:</span><br/>
<span id='145'>It shall be so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>Citizens</strong></span>

<span id='146'>It shall be so, it shall be so.</span><br/>

<span id='speech56'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate</span><br/>
<span id='148'>As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize</span><br/>
<span id='149'>As the dead carcasses of unburied men</span><br/>
<span id='150'>That do corrupt my air, I banish you;</span><br/>
<span id='151'>And here remain with your uncertainty!</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Fan you into despair! Have the power still</span><br/>
<span id='155'>To banish your defenders; till at length</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Making not reservation of yourselves,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Still your own foes, deliver you as most</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Abated captives to some nation</span><br/>
<span id='160'>That won you without blows! Despising,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>For you, the city, thus I turn my back:</span><br/>
<span id='162'>There is a world elsewhere.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, MENENIUS, Senators, and Patricians</em></p>

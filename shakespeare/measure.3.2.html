<h1>Measure for Measure</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</H3>
<h4>The street before the prison.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter, on one side, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before; on the other, ELBOW, and Officers with POMPEY</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will</span><br/>
<span id='2'>needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we</span><br/>
<span id='3'>shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>O heavens! what stuff is here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the</span><br/>
<span id='6'>merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by</span><br/>
<span id='7'>order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and</span><br/>
<span id='8'>furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that</span><br/>
<span id='9'>craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>And you, good brother father. What offence hath</span><br/>
<span id='12'>this man made you, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we</span><br/>
<span id='14'>take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found</span><br/>
<span id='15'>upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have</span><br/>
<span id='16'>sent to the deputy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!</span><br/>
<span id='18'>The evil that thou causest to be done,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>That is thy means to live. Do thou but think</span><br/>
<span id='20'>What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back</span><br/>
<span id='21'>From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>From their abominable and beastly touches</span><br/>
<span id='23'>I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Canst thou believe thy living is a life,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>sir, I would prove&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Correction and instruction must both work</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Ere this rude beast will profit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him</span><br/>
<span id='33'>warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if</span><br/>
<span id='34'>he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were</span><br/>
<span id='35'>as good go a mile on his errand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>That we were all, as some would seem to be,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>His neck will come to your waist,&mdash;a cord, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a</span><br/>
<span id='40'>friend of mine.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LUCIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there</span><br/>
<span id='43'>none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be</span><br/>
<span id='44'>had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and</span><br/>
<span id='45'>extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What</span><br/>
<span id='46'>sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't</span><br/>
<span id='47'>not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest</span><br/>
<span id='48'>thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is</span><br/>
<span id='49'>the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The</span><br/>
<span id='50'>trick of it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Still thus, and thus; still worse!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she</span><br/>
<span id='53'>still, ha?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she</span><br/>
<span id='55'>is herself in the tub.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be</span><br/>
<span id='57'>so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going</span><br/>
<span id='59'>to prison, Pompey?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Yes, faith, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I</span><br/>
<span id='62'>sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>For being a bawd, for being a bawd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the</span><br/>
<span id='65'>due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he</span><br/>
<span id='66'>doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you</span><br/>
<span id='69'>will keep the house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If</span><br/>
<span id='73'>you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the</span><br/>
<span id='74'>more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>And you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Come your ways, sir; come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>You will not bail me, then, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?</span><br/>
<span id='80'>what news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>ELBOW</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Come your ways, sir; come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Go to kennel, Pompey; go.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and Officers</em></p>
<span id='83'>What news, friar, of the duke?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>I know none. Can you tell me of any?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other</span><br/>
<span id='86'>some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from</span><br/>
<span id='89'>the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born</span><br/>
<span id='90'>to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he</span><br/>
<span id='91'>puts transgression to 't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>He does well in 't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in</span><br/>
<span id='94'>him: something too crabbed that way, friar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp</span><br/>
<span id='98'>it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put</span><br/>
<span id='99'>down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and</span><br/>
<span id='100'>woman after this downright way of creation: is it</span><br/>
<span id='101'>true, think you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>How should he be made, then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he</span><br/>
<span id='104'>was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is</span><br/>
<span id='105'>certain that when he makes water his urine is</span><br/>
<span id='106'>congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a</span><br/>
<span id='107'>motion generative; that's infallible.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the</span><br/>
<span id='110'>rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a</span><br/>
<span id='111'>man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a</span><br/>
<span id='113'>hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing</span><br/>
<span id='114'>a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he</span><br/>
<span id='115'>knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I never heard the absent duke much detected for</span><br/>
<span id='117'>women; he was not inclined that way.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>O, sir, you are deceived.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>'Tis not possible.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and</span><br/>
<span id='121'>his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the</span><br/>
<span id='122'>duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>that let me inform you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>You do him wrong, surely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the</span><br/>
<span id='126'>duke: and I believe I know the cause of his</span><br/>
<span id='127'>withdrawing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>What, I prithee, might be the cause?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the</span><br/>
<span id='130'>teeth and the lips: but this I can let you</span><br/>
<span id='131'>understand, the greater file of the subject held the</span><br/>
<span id='132'>duke to be wise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Wise! why, no question but he was.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:</span><br/>
<span id='136'>the very stream of his life and the business he hath</span><br/>
<span id='137'>helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better</span><br/>
<span id='138'>proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own</span><br/>
<span id='139'>bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the</span><br/>
<span id='140'>envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your</span><br/>
<span id='142'>knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Sir, I know him, and I love him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with</span><br/>
<span id='145'>dearer love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Come, sir, I know what I know.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>I can hardly believe that, since you know not what</span><br/>
<span id='148'>you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our</span><br/>
<span id='149'>prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your</span><br/>
<span id='150'>answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call</span><br/>
<span id='152'>upon you; and, I pray you, your name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to</span><br/>
<span id='155'>report you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>I fear you not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you</span><br/>
<span id='158'>imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I</span><br/>
<span id='159'>can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Claudio die to-morrow or no?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Why should he die, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>LUCIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would</span><br/>
<span id='165'>the duke we talk of were returned again: the</span><br/>
<span id='166'>ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with</span><br/>
<span id='167'>continency; sparrows must not build in his</span><br/>
<span id='168'>house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke</span><br/>
<span id='169'>yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would</span><br/>
<span id='170'>never bring them to light: would he were returned!</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The</span><br/>
<span id='173'>duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown</span><br/>
<span id='176'>bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>No might nor greatness in mortality</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny</span><br/>
<span id='179'>The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?</span><br/>
<span id='181'>But who comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ESCALUS, Provost, and Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>Go; away with her to prison!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>MISTRESS OVERDONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted</span><br/>
<span id='184'>a merciful man; good my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in</span><br/>
<span id='186'>the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play</span><br/>
<span id='187'>the tyrant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please</span><br/>
<span id='189'>your honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>MISTRESS OVERDONE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the</span><br/>
<span id='192'>duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child</span><br/>
<span id='193'>is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:</span><br/>
<span id='194'>I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be</span><br/>
<span id='196'>called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;</span><br/>
<span id='197'>no more words.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE</em></p>
<span id='198'>Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished</span><br/>
<span id='200'>with divines, and have all charitable preparation.</span><br/>
<span id='201'>If my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be</span><br/>
<span id='202'>so with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>So please you, this friar hath been with him, and</span><br/>
<span id='204'>advised him for the entertainment of death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>Good even, good father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>Bliss and goodness on you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='207'>Of whence are you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>Not of this country, though my chance is now</span><br/>
<span id='209'>To use it for my time: I am a brother</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Of gracious order, late come from the See</span><br/>
<span id='211'>In special business from his holiness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='212'>What news abroad i' the world?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='213'>None, but that there is so great a fever on</span><br/>
<span id='214'>goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:</span><br/>
<span id='215'>novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous</span><br/>
<span id='216'>to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous</span><br/>
<span id='217'>to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce</span><br/>
<span id='218'>truth enough alive to make societies secure; but</span><br/>
<span id='219'>security enough to make fellowships accurst: much</span><br/>
<span id='220'>upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This</span><br/>
<span id='221'>news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I</span><br/>
<span id='222'>pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='223'>One that, above all other strifes, contended</span><br/>
<span id='224'>especially to know himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='225'>What pleasure was he given to?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>ESCALUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='226'>Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at</span><br/>
<span id='227'>any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a</span><br/>
<span id='228'>gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to</span><br/>
<span id='229'>his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;</span><br/>
<span id='230'>and let me desire to know how you find Claudio</span><br/>
<span id='231'>prepared. I am made to understand that you have</span><br/>
<span id='232'>lent him visitation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='233'>He professes to have received no sinister measure</span><br/>

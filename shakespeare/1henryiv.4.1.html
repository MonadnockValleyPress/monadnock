<h1>Henry IV, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, and DOUGLAS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth</span><br/>
<span id='2'>In this fine age were not thought flattery,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Such attribution should the Douglas have,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>As not a soldier of this season's stamp</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Should go so general current through the world.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy</span><br/>
<span id='7'>The tongues of soothers; but a braver place</span><br/>
<span id='8'>In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>EARL OF DOUGLAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Thou art the king of honour:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>No man so potent breathes upon the ground</span><br/>
<span id='12'>But I will beard him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Do so, and 'tis well.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger with letters</em></p>
<span id='14'>What letters hast thou there?&mdash;I can but thank you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>These letters come from your father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Letters from him! why comes he not himself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick</span><br/>
<span id='19'>In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Under whose government come they along?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And at the time of my departure thence</span><br/>
<span id='25'>He was much fear'd by his physicians.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>I would the state of time had first been whole</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Ere he by sickness had been visited:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>His health was never better worth than now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect</span><br/>
<span id='30'>The very life-blood of our enterprise;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>He writes me here, that inward sickness&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And that his friends by deputation could not</span><br/>
<span id='34'>So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet</span><br/>
<span id='35'>To lay so dangerous and dear a trust</span><br/>
<span id='36'>On any soul removed but on his own.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>That with our small conjunction we should on,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To see how fortune is disposed to us;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>For, as he writes, there is no quailing now.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Because the king is certainly possess'd</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Of all our purposes. What say you to it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Your father's sickness is a maim to us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Seems more than we shall find it: were it good</span><br/>
<span id='47'>To set the exact wealth of all our states</span><br/>
<span id='48'>All at one cast? to set so rich a main</span><br/>
<span id='49'>On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?</span><br/>
<span id='50'>It were not good; for therein should we read</span><br/>
<span id='51'>The very bottom and the soul of hope,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The very list, the very utmost bound</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Of all our fortunes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>EARL OF DOUGLAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>'Faith, and so we should;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Where now remains a sweet reversion:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>We may boldly spend upon the hope of what</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Is to come in:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>A comfort of retirement lives in this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>A rendezvous, a home to fly unto.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>If that the devil and mischance look big</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>But yet I would your father had been here.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>The quality and hair of our attempt</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Brooks no division: it will be thought</span><br/>
<span id='65'>By some, that know not why he is away,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And think how such an apprehension</span><br/>
<span id='69'>May turn the tide of fearful faction</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And breed a kind of question in our cause;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>For well you know we of the offering side</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence</span><br/>
<span id='74'>The eye of reason may pry in upon us:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>This absence of your father's draws a curtain,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>That shows the ignorant a kind of fear</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Before not dreamt of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>You strain too far.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>I rather of his absence make this use:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>It lends a lustre and more great opinion,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>A larger dare to our great enterprise,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Than if the earl were here; for men must think,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>If we without his help can make a head</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To push against a kingdom, with his help</span><br/>
<span id='85'>We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>EARL OF DOUGLAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>As heart can think: there is not such a word</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>VERNON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>No harm: what more?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>VERNON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>And further, I have learn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>The king himself in person is set forth,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Or hitherwards intended speedily,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>With strong and mighty preparation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And bid it pass?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>VERNON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>                  All furnish'd, all in arms;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>All plumed like estridges that with the wind</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Baited like eagles having lately bathed;</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Glittering in golden coats, like images;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>As full of spirit as the month of May,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.</span><br/>
<span id='109'>I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And vaulted with such ease into his seat,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus</span><br/>
<span id='115'>And witch the world with noble horsemanship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:</span><br/>
<span id='118'>They come like sacrifices in their trim,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war</span><br/>
<span id='120'>All hot and bleeding will we offer them:</span><br/>
<span id='121'>The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire</span><br/>
<span id='123'>To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>O that Glendower were come!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>VERNON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>There is more news:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>EARL OF DOUGLAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>WORCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>What may the king's whole battle reach unto?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>VERNON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>To thirty thousand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Forty let it be:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>My father and Glendower being both away,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>The powers of us may serve so great a day.</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Come, let us take a muster speedily:</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Doomsday is near; die all, die merrily.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>EARL OF DOUGLAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Talk not of dying: I am out of fear</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Of death or death's hand for this one-half year.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

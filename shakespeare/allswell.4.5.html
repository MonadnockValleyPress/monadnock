<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene V</h3>
<h4>Rousillon. The Count's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and Clown</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta</span><br/>
<span id='2'>fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have</span><br/>
<span id='3'>made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in</span><br/>
<span id='4'>his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at</span><br/>
<span id='5'>this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced</span><br/>
<span id='6'>by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>I would I had not known him; it was the death of the</span><br/>
<span id='8'>most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had</span><br/>
<span id='9'>praise for creating. If she had partaken of my</span><br/>
<span id='10'>flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I</span><br/>
<span id='11'>could not have owed her a more rooted love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick a</span><br/>
<span id='13'>thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the</span><br/>
<span id='15'>salad, or rather, the herb of grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much</span><br/>
<span id='18'>skill in grass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Your distinction?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>So you were a knave at his service, indeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>At your service.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>No, no, no.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as</span><br/>
<span id='29'>great a prince as you are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Who's that? a Frenchman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Faith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomy</span><br/>
<span id='32'>is more hotter in France than there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>What prince is that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of</span><br/>
<span id='35'>darkness; alias, the devil.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Hold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not this</span><br/>
<span id='37'>to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>serve him still.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a</span><br/>
<span id='40'>great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a</span><br/>
<span id='41'>good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the</span><br/>
<span id='42'>world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for</span><br/>
<span id='43'>the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be</span><br/>
<span id='44'>too little for pomp to enter: some that humble</span><br/>
<span id='45'>themselves may; but the many will be too chill and</span><br/>
<span id='46'>tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that</span><br/>
<span id='47'>leads to the broad gate and the great fire.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I</span><br/>
<span id='49'>tell thee so before, because I would not fall out</span><br/>
<span id='50'>with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well</span><br/>
<span id='51'>looked to, without any tricks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be</span><br/>
<span id='53'>jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>A shrewd knave and an unhappy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much</span><br/>
<span id='56'>sport out of him: by his authority he remains here,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to</span><br/>
<span id='60'>tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death and</span><br/>
<span id='61'>that my lord your son was upon his return home, I</span><br/>
<span id='62'>moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of</span><br/>
<span id='63'>my daughter; which, in the minority of them both,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did</span><br/>
<span id='65'>first propose: his highness hath promised me to do</span><br/>
<span id='66'>it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath</span><br/>
<span id='67'>conceived against your son, there is no fitter</span><br/>
<span id='68'>matter. How does your ladyship like it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>With very much content, my lord; and I wish it</span><br/>
<span id='70'>happily effected.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able</span><br/>
<span id='72'>body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here</span><br/>
<span id='73'>to-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in such</span><br/>
<span id='74'>intelligence hath seldom failed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I</span><br/>
<span id='76'>die. I have letters that my son will be here</span><br/>
<span id='77'>to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain</span><br/>
<span id='78'>with me till they meet together.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might</span><br/>
<span id='80'>safely be admitted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>You need but plead your honourable privilege.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but I</span><br/>
<span id='83'>thank my God it holds yet.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Clown</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of</span><br/>
<span id='85'>velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under't</span><br/>
<span id='86'>or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of</span><br/>
<span id='87'>velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a</span><br/>
<span id='88'>half, but his right cheek is worn bare.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery</span><br/>
<span id='90'>of honour; so belike is that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>But it is your carbonadoed face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LAFEU</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Let us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talk</span><br/>
<span id='93'>with the young noble soldier.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Faith there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine</span><br/>
<span id='95'>hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head</span><br/>
<span id='96'>and nod at every man.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

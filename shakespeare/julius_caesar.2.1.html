<h1>Julius Caesar</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Rome. Brutus's orchard.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter BRUTUS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>What, Lucius, ho!</span><br/>
<span id='2'>I cannot, by the progress of the stars,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!</span><br/>
<span id='4'>I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LUCIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Call'd you, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>When it is lighted, come and call me here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>I will, my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>It must be by his death: and for my part,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>I know no personal cause to spurn at him,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>But for the general. He would be crown'd:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>How that might change his nature, there's the question.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And that craves wary walking. Crown him?&mdash;that;&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>That at his will he may do danger with.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>I have not known when his affections sway'd</span><br/>
<span id='21'>More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>But when he once attains the upmost round.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>He then unto the ladder turns his back,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</span><br/>
<span id='27'>By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Will bear no colour for the thing he is,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Would run to these and these extremities:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And therefore think him as a serpent's egg</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And kill him in the shell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter LUCIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>The taper burneth in your closet, sir.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Searching the window for a flint, I found</span><br/>
<span id='37'>This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>It did not lie there when I went to bed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Gives him the letter</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Get you to bed again; it is not day.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>I know not, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Look in the calendar, and bring me word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>I will, sir.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>The exhalations whizzing in the air</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Give so much light that I may read by them.</span><br/>
<p><em>Opens the letter and reads</em></p>
<span id='46'>'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Shall Rome,  & c. Speak, strike, redress!</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Such instigations have been often dropp'd</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Where I have took them up.</span><br/>
<span id='51'>'Shall Rome,  & c.' Thus must I piece it out:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?</span><br/>
<span id='53'>My ancestors did from the streets of Rome</span><br/>
<span id='54'>The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated</span><br/>
<span id='56'>To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>If the redress will follow, thou receivest</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter LUCIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.</span><br/>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit LUCIUS</em></p>
<span id='61'>Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>I have not slept.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Between the acting of a dreadful thing</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And the first motion, all the interim is</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>The Genius and the mortal instruments</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Are then in council; and the state of man,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Like to a little kingdom, suffers then</span><br/>
<span id='69'>The nature of an insurrection.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter LUCIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Who doth desire to see you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Is he alone?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>No, sir, there are more with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Do you know them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And half their faces buried in their cloaks,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>That by no means I may discover them</span><br/>
<span id='78'>By any mark of favour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Let 'em enter.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit LUCIUS</em></p>
<span id='80'>They are the faction. O conspiracy,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>When evils are most free? O, then by day</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Hide it in smiles and affability:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>For if thou path, thy native semblance on,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Not Erebus itself were dim enough</span><br/>
<span id='88'>To hide thee from prevention.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>I think we are too bold upon your rest:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>I have been up this hour, awake all night.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Know I these men that come along with you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Yes, every man of them, and no man here</span><br/>
<span id='94'>But honours you; and every one doth wish</span><br/>
<span id='95'>You had but that opinion of yourself</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Which every noble Roman bears of you.</span><br/>
<span id='97'>This is Trebonius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>                  He is welcome hither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>This, Decius Brutus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>He is welcome too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>They are all welcome.</span><br/>
<span id='103'>What watchful cares do interpose themselves</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Betwixt your eyes and night?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Shall I entreat a word?</span><br/>
<p><em>BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DECIUS BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>No.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>CINNA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines</span><br/>
<span id='109'>That fret the clouds are messengers of day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>You shall confess that you are both deceived.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Which is a great way growing on the south,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Weighing the youthful season of the year.</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Some two months hence up higher toward the north</span><br/>
<span id='115'>He first presents his fire; and the high east</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Give me your hands all over, one by one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>And let us swear our resolution.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>No, not an oath: if not the face of men,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>If these be motives weak, break off betimes,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And every man hence to his idle bed;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>So let high-sighted tyranny range on,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>As I am sure they do, bear fire enough</span><br/>
<span id='126'>To kindle cowards and to steel with valour</span><br/>
<span id='127'>The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>What need we any spur but our own cause,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>To prick us to redress? what other bond</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And will not palter? and what other oath</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Than honesty to honesty engaged,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>That this shall be, or we will fall for it?</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls</span><br/>
<span id='136'>That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain</span><br/>
<span id='138'>The even virtue of our enterprise,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>To think that or our cause or our performance</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Did need an oath; when every drop of blood</span><br/>
<span id='142'>That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Is guilty of a several bastardy,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>If he do break the smallest particle</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?</span><br/>
<span id='147'>I think he will stand very strong with us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Let us not leave him out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>CINNA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>No, by no means.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>METELLUS CIMBER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>O, let us have him, for his silver hairs</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Will purchase us a good opinion</span><br/>
<span id='152'>And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:</span><br/>
<span id='153'>It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>But all be buried in his gravity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>O, name him not: let us not break with him;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>For he will never follow any thing</span><br/>
<span id='158'>That other men begin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Then leave him out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CASCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Indeed he is not fit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DECIUS BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him</span><br/>
<span id='165'>A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>If he improve them, may well stretch so far</span><br/>
<span id='167'>As to annoy us all: which to prevent,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Let Antony and Caesar fall together.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.</span><br/>
<span id='174'>We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;</span><br/>
<span id='175'>And in the spirit of men there is no blood:</span><br/>
<span id='176'>O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:</span><br/>
<span id='182'>And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Stir up their servants to an act of rage,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Our purpose necessary and not envious:</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Which so appearing to the common eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.</span><br/>
<span id='188'>And for Mark Antony, think not of him;</span><br/>
<span id='189'>For he can do no more than Caesar's arm</span><br/>
<span id='190'>When Caesar's head is off.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>Yet I fear him;</span><br/>
<span id='192'>For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:</span><br/>
<span id='194'>If he love Caesar, all that he can do</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:</span><br/>
<span id='196'>And that were much he should; for he is given</span><br/>
<span id='197'>To sports, to wildness and much company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>TREBONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>There is no fear in him; let him not die;</span><br/>
<span id='199'>For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.</span><br/>
<p><em>Clock strikes</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>Peace! count the clock.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>The clock hath stricken three.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>TREBONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>'Tis time to part.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>                  But it is doubtful yet,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;</span><br/>
<span id='205'>For he is superstitious grown of late,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Quite from the main opinion he held once</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:</span><br/>
<span id='208'>It may be, these apparent prodigies,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>The unaccustom'd terror of this night,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>And the persuasion of his augurers,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>May hold him from the Capitol to-day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>DECIUS BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='212'>Never fear that: if he be so resolved,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear</span><br/>
<span id='214'>That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,</span><br/>
<span id='216'>Lions with toils and men with flatterers;</span><br/>
<span id='217'>But when I tell him he hates flatterers,</span><br/>
<span id='218'>He says he does, being then most flattered.</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Let me work;</span><br/>
<span id='220'>For I can give his humour the true bent,</span><br/>
<span id='221'>And I will bring him to the Capitol.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='222'>Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='223'>By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>CINNA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='224'>Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>METELLUS CIMBER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='225'>Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:</span><br/>
<span id='227'>I wonder none of you have thought of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='228'>Now, good Metellus, go along by him:</span><br/>
<span id='229'>He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;</span><br/>
<span id='230'>Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>CASSIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='231'>The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.</span><br/>
<span id='232'>And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember</span><br/>
<span id='233'>What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='234'>Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;</span><br/>
<span id='235'>Let not our looks put on our purposes,</span><br/>
<span id='236'>But bear it as our Roman actors do,</span><br/>
<span id='237'>With untired spirits and formal constancy:</span><br/>
<span id='238'>And so good morrow to you every one.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but BRUTUS</em></p>
<span id='239'>Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;</span><br/>
<span id='240'>Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:</span><br/>
<span id='241'>Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,</span><br/>
<span id='242'>Which busy care draws in the brains of men;</span><br/>
<span id='243'>Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PORTIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>

<span id='244'>Brutus, my lord!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='245'>Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?</span><br/>
<span id='246'>It is not for your health thus to commit</span><br/>
<span id='247'>Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>PORTIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='248'>Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,</span><br/>
<span id='249'>Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,</span><br/>
<span id='250'>You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,</span><br/>
<span id='251'>Musing and sighing, with your arms across,</span><br/>
<span id='252'>And when I ask'd you what the matter was,</span><br/>
<span id='253'>You stared upon me with ungentle looks;</span><br/>
<span id='254'>I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,</span><br/>
<span id='255'>And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;</span><br/>
<span id='256'>Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,</span><br/>
<span id='257'>But, with an angry wafture of your hand,</span><br/>
<span id='258'>Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;</span><br/>
<span id='259'>Fearing to strengthen that impatience</span><br/>
<span id='260'>Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal</span><br/>

<span id='262'>Which sometime hath his hour with every man.</span><br/>
<span id='263'>It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,</span><br/>
<span id='264'>And could it work so much upon your shape</span><br/>
<span id='265'>As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,</span><br/>
<span id='266'>I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='267'>Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.</span><br/>

<span id='269'>Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,</span><br/>
<span id='270'>He would embrace the means to come by it.</span><br/>

<span id='272'>Is Brutus sick? and is it physical</span><br/>
<span id='273'>To walk unbraced and suck up the humours</span><br/>
<span id='274'>Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,</span><br/>
<span id='275'>And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,</span><br/>
<span id='276'>To dare the vile contagion of the night</span><br/>
<span id='277'>And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air</span><br/>
<span id='278'>To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;</span><br/>
<span id='279'>You have some sick offence within your mind,</span><br/>
<span id='280'>Which, by the right and virtue of my place,</span><br/>
<span id='281'>I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,</span><br/>
<span id='282'>I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,</span><br/>
<span id='283'>By all your vows of love and that great vow</span><br/>
<span id='284'>Which did incorporate and make us one,</span><br/>
<span id='285'>That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,</span><br/>
<span id='286'>Why you are heavy, and what men to-night</span><br/>
<span id='287'>Have had to resort to you: for here have been</span><br/>
<span id='288'>Some six or seven, who did hide their faces</span><br/>
<span id='289'>Even from darkness.</span><br/>

<span id='294'>That appertain to you? Am I yourself</span><br/>
<span id='295'>But, as it were, in sort or limitation,</span><br/>
<span id='296'>To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,</span><br/>
<span id='297'>And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs</span><br/>
<span id='298'>Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,</span><br/>

<span id='332'>Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,</span><br/>

<span id='speech80'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>

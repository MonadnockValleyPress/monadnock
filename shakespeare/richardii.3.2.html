<h1>Richard II</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The coast of Wales. A castle in view.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Drums; flourish and colours. Enter KING RICHARD II, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, DUKE OF AUMERLE, and Soldiers</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>After your late tossing on the breaking seas?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy</span><br/>
<span id='5'>To stand upon my kingdom once again.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>As a long-parted mother with her child</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And do thee favours with my royal hands.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Which with usurping steps do trample thee:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>This earth shall have a feeling and these stones</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BISHOP OF CARLISLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>The means that heaven yields must be embraced,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And not neglected; else, if heaven would,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>The proffer'd means of succor and redress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Grows strong and great in substance and in power.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not</span><br/>
<span id='37'>That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen</span><br/>
<span id='40'>In murders and in outrage, boldly here;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>But when from under this terrestrial ball</span><br/>
<span id='42'>He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And darts his light through every guilty hole,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Then murders, treasons and detested sins,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?</span><br/>
<span id='47'>So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Who all this while hath revell'd in the night</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>His treasons will sit blushing in his face,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Not able to endure the sight of day,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Not all the water in the rough rude sea</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>The breath of worldly men cannot depose</span><br/>
<span id='57'>The deputy elected by the Lord:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd</span><br/>
<span id='59'>To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay</span><br/>
<span id='61'>A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter EARL OF SALISBURY</em></p>
<span id='63'>Welcome, my lord	how far off lies your power?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>EARL OF SALISBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And bids me speak of nothing but despair.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>O, call back yesterday, bid time return,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!</span><br/>
<span id='71'>To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>But now the blood of twenty thousand men</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And, till so much blood thither come again,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Have I not reason to look pale and dead?</span><br/>
<span id='80'>All souls that will be safe fly from my side,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>For time hath set a blot upon my pride.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>I had forgot myself; am I not king?</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes</span><br/>
<span id='87'>At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?</span><br/>
<span id='89'>High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>More health and happiness betide my liege</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And what loss is it to be rid of care?</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>They break their faith to God as well as us:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:</span><br/>
<span id='103'>The worst is death, and death will have his day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd</span><br/>
<span id='105'>To bear the tidings of calamity.</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Like an unseasonable stormy day,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>As if the world were all dissolved to tears,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>So high above his limits swells the rage</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land</span><br/>
<span id='111'>With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Strive to speak big and clap their female joints</span><br/>
<span id='115'>In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:</span><br/>
<span id='116'>The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Of double-fatal yew against thy state;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>And all goes worse than I have power to tell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?</span><br/>
<span id='123'>What is become of Bushy? where is Green?</span><br/>
<span id='124'>That they have let the dangerous enemy</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?</span><br/>
<span id='126'>If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:</span><br/>
<span id='127'>I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Would they make peace? terrible hell make war</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Upon their spotted souls for this offence!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Sweet love, I see, changing his property,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made</span><br/>
<span id='138'>With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound</span><br/>
<span id='140'>And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Where is the duke my father with his power?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>No matter where; of comfort no man speak:</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Let's choose executors and talk of wills:</span><br/>
<span id='149'>And yet not so, for what can we bequeath</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Save our deposed bodies to the ground?</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>And nothing can we call our own but death</span><br/>
<span id='153'>And that small model of the barren earth</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.</span><br/>
<span id='155'>For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground</span><br/>
<span id='156'>And tell sad stories of the death of kings;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>How some have been deposed; some slain in war,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>All murder'd: for within the hollow crown</span><br/>
<span id='161'>That rounds the mortal temples of a king</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Allowing him a breath, a little scene,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Infusing him with self and vain conceit,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>As if this flesh which walls about our life,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Comes at the last and with a little pin</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood</span><br/>
<span id='172'>With solemn reverence: throw away respect,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>For you have but mistook me all this while:</span><br/>
<span id='175'>I live with bread like you, feel want,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>How can you say to me, I am a king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BISHOP OF CARLISLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>But presently prevent the ways to wail.</span><br/>
<span id='180'>To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>And so your follies fight against yourself.</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:</span><br/>
<span id='184'>And fight and die is death destroying death;</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>My father hath a power; inquire of him</span><br/>
<span id='187'>And learn to make a body of a limb.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come</span><br/>
<span id='189'>To change blows with thee for our day of doom.</span><br/>
<span id='190'>This ague fit of fear is over-blown;</span><br/>
<span id='191'>An easy task it is to win our own.</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>Men judge by the complexion of the sky</span><br/>
<span id='195'>The state and inclination of the day:</span><br/>
<span id='196'>So may you by my dull and heavy eye,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.</span><br/>
<span id='198'>I play the torturer, by small and small</span><br/>
<span id='199'>To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>And all your northern castles yielded up,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>And all your southern gentlemen in arms</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Upon his party.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>                  Thou hast said enough.</span><br/>
<p><em>To DUKE OF AUMERLE</em></p>
<span id='205'>Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Of that sweet way I was in to despair!</span><br/>
<span id='207'>What say you now? what comfort have we now?</span><br/>
<span id='208'>By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly</span><br/>
<span id='209'>That bids me be of comfort any more.</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;</span><br/>
<span id='211'>A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.</span><br/>
<span id='212'>That power I have, discharge; and let them go</span><br/>
<span id='213'>To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>For I have none: let no man speak again</span><br/>
<span id='215'>To alter this, for counsel is but vain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>My liege, one word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>He does me double wrong</span><br/>
<span id='218'>That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Discharge my followers: let them hence away,</span><br/>
<span id='220'>From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Henry VIII</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Westminster. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter two Gentlemen, meeting</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Whither away so fast?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>O, God save ye!</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Even to the hall, to hear what shall become</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Of the great Duke of Buckingham.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>I'll save you</span><br/>
<span id='6'>That labour, sir. All's now done, but the ceremony</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Of bringing back the prisoner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Were you there?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Yes, indeed, was I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Pray, speak what has happen'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>You may guess quickly what.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Is he found guilty?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>I am sorry for't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>                  So are a number more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>But, pray, how pass'd it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>I'll tell you in a little. The great duke</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Came to the bar; where to his accusations</span><br/>
<span id='19'>He pleaded still not guilty and alleged</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>The king's attorney on the contrary</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired</span><br/>
<span id='24'>To have brought viva voce to his face:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>At which appear'd against him his surveyor;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Hopkins, that made this mischief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>That was he</span><br/>
<span id='30'>That fed him with his prophecies?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>The same.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>All these accused him strongly; which he fain</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And so his peers, upon this evidence,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Have found him guilty of high treason. Much</span><br/>
<span id='36'>He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Was either pitied in him or forgotten.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>After all this, how did he bear himself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>When he was brought again to the bar, to hear</span><br/>
<span id='40'>His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd</span><br/>
<span id='41'>With such an agony, he sweat extremely,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>But he fell to himself again, and sweetly</span><br/>
<span id='44'>In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>I do not think he fears death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Sure, he does not:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>He never was so womanish; the cause</span><br/>
<span id='48'>He may a little grieve at.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Certainly</span><br/>
<span id='50'>The cardinal is the end of this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>'Tis likely,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Then deputy of Ireland; who removed,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Lest he should help his father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>That trick of state</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Was a deep envious one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>At his return</span><br/>
<span id='59'>No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And generally, whoever the king favours,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>The cardinal instantly will find employment,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And far enough from court too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>All the commons</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as much</span><br/>
<span id='66'>They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>The mirror of all courtesy;&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Stay there, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment; tip-staves  before him; the axe with the edge towards him;  halberds on each side: accompanied with LOVELL, VAUX, SANDS, and common people</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Let's stand close, and behold him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>All good people,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>You that thus far have come to pity me,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>I have this day received a traitor's judgment,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And if I have a co nscience, let it sink me,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!</span><br/>
<span id='78'>The law I bear no malice for my death;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>'T has done, upon the premises, but justice:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>For further life in this world I ne'er hope,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Nor will I sue, although the king have mercies</span><br/>
<span id='87'>More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Is only bitter to him, only dying,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Go with me, like good angels, to my end;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, o' God's name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>I do beseech your grace, for charity,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>If ever any malice in your heart</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you</span><br/>
<span id='99'>As I would be forgiven: I forgive all;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>There cannot be those numberless offences</span><br/>
<span id='101'>'Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>no black envy</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his grace;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell him</span><br/>
<span id='105'>You met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Yet are the king's; and, till my soul forsake,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Shall cry for blessings on him: may he live</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Longer than I have time to tell his years!</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Ever beloved and loving may his rule be!</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And when old time shall lead him to his end,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Goodness and he fill up one monument!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>To the water side I must conduct your grace;</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Who undertakes you to your end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>VAUX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Prepare there,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>The duke is coming: see the barge be ready;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And fit it with such furniture as suits</span><br/>
<span id='118'>The greatness of his person.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Nay, Sir Nicholas,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>When I came hither, I was lord high constable</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Yet I am richer than my base accusers,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for't.</span><br/>
<span id='126'>My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Who first raised head against usurping Richard,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Flying for succor to his servant Banister,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying</span><br/>
<span id='132'>My father's loss, like a most royal prince,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Restored me to my honours, and, out of ruins,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Made my name once more noble. Now his son,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all</span><br/>
<span id='136'>That made me happy at one stroke has taken</span><br/>
<span id='137'>For ever from the world. I had my trial,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>And, must needs say, a noble one; which makes me,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>A little happier than my wretched father:</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most;</span><br/>
<span id='142'>A most unnatural and faithless service!</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Heaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>This from a dying man receive as certain:</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends</span><br/>
<span id='147'>And give your hearts to, when they once perceive</span><br/>
<span id='148'>The least rub in your fortunes, fall away</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Like water from ye, never found again</span><br/>
<span id='150'>But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Pray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hour</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Of my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:</span><br/>
<span id='153'>And when you would say something that is sad,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and Train</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>I fear, too many curses on their beads</span><br/>
<span id='157'>That were the authors.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>If the duke be guiltless,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>'Tis full of woe: yet I can give you inkling</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Greater than this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>                  Good angels keep it from us!</span><br/>
<span id='163'>What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>This secret is so weighty, 'twill require</span><br/>
<span id='165'>A strong faith to conceal it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Let me have it;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>I do not talk much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>I am confident,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>You shall, sir: did you not of late days hear</span><br/>
<span id='170'>A buzzing of a separation</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Between the king and Katharine?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Yes, but it held not:</span><br/>
<span id='173'>For when the king once heard it, out of anger</span><br/>
<span id='174'>He sent command to the lord mayor straight</span><br/>
<span id='175'>To stop the rumor, and allay those tongues</span><br/>
<span id='176'>That durst disperse it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>But that slander, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Is found a truth now: for it grows again</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Fresher than e'er it was; and held for certain</span><br/>
<span id='180'>The king will venture at it. Either the cardinal,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Or some about him near, have, out of malice</span><br/>
<span id='182'>To the good queen, possess'd him with a scruple</span><br/>
<span id='183'>That will undo her: to confirm this too,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately;</span><br/>
<span id='185'>As all think, for this business.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>'Tis the cardinal;</span><br/>
<span id='187'>And merely to revenge him on the emperor</span><br/>
<span id='188'>For not bestowing on him, at his asking,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purposed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>I think you have hit the mark: but is't not cruel</span><br/>
<span id='191'>That she should feel the smart of this? The cardinal</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Will have his will, and she must fall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>'Tis woful.</span><br/>
<span id='194'>We are too open here to argue this;</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Let's think in private more.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

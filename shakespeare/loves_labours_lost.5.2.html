<h1>Love's Labours Lost</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The same.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the PRINCESS, KATHARINE, ROSALINE, and MARIA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>If fairings come thus plentifully in:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>A lady wall'd about with diamonds!</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Look you what I have from the loving king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Madame, came nothing else along with that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme</span><br/>
<span id='7'>As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>That was the way to make his godhead wax,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>For he hath been five thousand years a boy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And so she died: had she been light, like you,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And so may you; for a light heart lives long.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>A light condition in a beauty dark.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>We need more light to find your meaning out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>So do not you, for you are a light wench.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But Rosaline, you have a favour too:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Who sent it? and what is it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I would you knew:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>An if my face were but as fair as yours,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>My favour were as great; be witness this.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>I were the fairest goddess on the ground:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Any thing like?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Fair as a text B in a copy-book.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>My red dominical, my golden letter:</span><br/>
<span id='46'>O, that your face were not so full of O's!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Madam, this glove.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>                  Did he not send you twain?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Yes, madam, and moreover</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>A huge translation of hypocrisy,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MARIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>The letter is too long by half a mile.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart</span><br/>
<span id='58'>The chain were longer and the letter short?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>MARIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Ay, or I would these hands might never part.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>O that I knew he were but in by the week!</span><br/>
<span id='64'>How I would make him fawn and beg and seek</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And wait the season and observe the times</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And shape his service wholly to my hests</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And make him proud to make me proud that jests!</span><br/>
<span id='69'>So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state</span><br/>
<span id='70'>That he should be my fool and I his fate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>The blood of youth burns not with such excess</span><br/>
<span id='76'>As gravity's revolt to wantonness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>MARIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Folly in fools bears not so strong a note</span><br/>
<span id='78'>As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Since all the power thereof it doth apply</span><br/>
<span id='80'>To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BOYET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Thy news Boyet?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>                  Prepare, madam, prepare!</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they</span><br/>
<span id='91'>That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Under the cool shade of a sycamore</span><br/>
<span id='93'>I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Toward that shade I might behold addrest</span><br/>
<span id='96'>The king and his companions: warily</span><br/>
<span id='97'>I stole into a neighbour thicket by,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And overheard what you shall overhear,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>That, by and by, disguised they will be here.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Their herald is a pretty knavish page,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Action and accent did they teach him there;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And ever and anon they made a doubt</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Presence majestical would put him out,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'</span><br/>
<span id='108'>The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'</span><br/>
<span id='110'>With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore</span><br/>
<span id='113'>A better speech was never spoke before;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Another, with his finger and his thumb,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'</span><br/>
<span id='116'>The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'</span><br/>
<span id='117'>The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.</span><br/>
<span id='118'>With that, they all did tumble on the ground,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>With such a zealous laughter, so profound,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>That in this spleen ridiculous appears,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>But what, but what, come they to visit us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;</span><br/>
<span id='126'>And every one his love-feat will advance</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Unto his several mistress, which they'll know</span><br/>
<span id='128'>By favours several which they did bestow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And not a man of them shall have the grace,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And then the king will court thee for his dear;</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.</span><br/>
<span id='137'>And change your favours too; so shall your loves</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>KATHARINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>But in this changing what is your intent?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:</span><br/>
<span id='142'>They do it but in mocking merriment;</span><br/>
<span id='143'>And mock for mock is only my intent.</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Their several counsels they unbosom shall</span><br/>
<span id='145'>To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Upon the next occasion that we meet,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>With visages displayed, to talk and greet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>But shall we dance, if they desire to't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>No, to the death, we will not move a foot;</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>And quite divorce his memory from his part.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>PRINCESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt</span><br/>
<span id='155'>The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out</span><br/>
<span id='156'>There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:</span><br/>
<span id='158'>So shall we stay, mocking intended game,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.</span><br/>
<p><em>Trumpets sound within</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.</span><br/>
<p><em>The Ladies mask</em></p>
<p><em>Enter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; FERDINAND,  BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits, and masked</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>MOTH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>MOTH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>A holy parcel of the fairest dames.</span><br/>
<p><em>The Ladies turn their backs to him</em></p>
<span id='164'>That ever turn'd their&mdash;backs&mdash;to mortal views!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>[Aside to MOTH]  Their eyes, villain, their eyes!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>MOTH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!&mdash;Out&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>True; out indeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>MOTH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Not to behold&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>[Aside to MOTH]  Once to behold, rogue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>MOTH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>&mdash;with your sun-beamed eyes&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>They will not answer to that epithet;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>MOTH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>They do not mark me, and that brings me out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit MOTH</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:</span><br/>
<span id='178'>If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:</span><br/>
<span id='179'>That some plain man recount their purposes</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Know what they would.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>What would you with the princess?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>What would they, say they?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>She says, you have it, and you may be gone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Say to her, we have measured many miles</span><br/>
<span id='188'>To tread a measure with her on this grass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>They say, that they have measured many a mile</span><br/>
<span id='190'>To tread a measure with you on this grass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>It is not so. Ask them how many inches</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Is in one mile: if they have measured many,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>The measure then of one is easily told.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>If to come hither you have measured miles,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>And many miles, the princess bids you tell</span><br/>
<span id='196'>How many inches doth fill up one mile.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>BOYET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>She hears herself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>                  How many weary steps,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Are number'd in the travel of one mile?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>BIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>We number nothing that we spend for you:</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Our duty is so rich, so infinite,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>That we may do it still without accompt.</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>That we, like savages, may worship it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='207'>My face is but a moon, and clouded too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='211'>O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='213'>Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='215'>Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.</span><br/>
<p><em>Music plays</em></p>
<span id='216'>Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='219'>Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.</span><br/>
<span id='220'>The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech89'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>Our ears vouchsafe it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech90'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='222'>But your legs should do it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech91'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='223'>Since you are strangers and come here by chance,</span><br/>
<span id='224'>We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech92'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='225'>Why take we hands, then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech93'><strong>ROSALINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='226'>Only to part friends:</span><br/>
<span id='227'>Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='913'>cuckoo. Ver, begin.</span><br/>
<p><em>THE SONG</em></p>
<span id='914'>SPRING.</span><br/>
<span id='915'>When daisies pied and violets blue</span><br/>
<span id='916'>And lady-smocks all silver-white</span><br/>
<span id='917'>And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue</span><br/>
<span id='918'>Do paint the meadows with delight,</span><br/>

<span id='920'>Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 	Cuckoo;</span><br/>
<span id='921'>Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,</span><br/>
<span id='922'>Unpleasing to a married ear!</span><br/>
<span id='923'>When shepherds pipe on oaten straws</span><br/>
<span id='924'>And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,</span><br/>
<span id='925'>When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,</span><br/>
<span id='926'>And maidens bleach their summer smocks</span><br/>
<span id='927'>The cuckoo then, on every tree,</span><br/>
<span id='928'>Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 	Cuckoo;</span><br/>
<span id='929'>Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,</span><br/>

<span id='931'>WINTER.</span><br/>
<span id='932'>When icicles hang by the wall</span><br/>
<span id='933'>And Dick the shepherd blows his nail</span><br/>
<span id='934'>And Tom bears logs into the hall</span><br/>
<span id='935'>And milk comes frozen home in pail,</span><br/>
<span id='936'>When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,</span><br/>
<span id='937'>Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit;</span><br/>
<span id='938'>Tu-who, a merry note,</span><br/>
<span id='939'>While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.</span><br/>
<span id='940'>When all aloud the wind doth blow</span><br/>
<span id='941'>And coughing drowns the parson's saw</span><br/>
<span id='942'>And birds sit brooding in the snow</span><br/>
<span id='943'>And Marian's nose looks red and raw,</span><br/>
<span id='944'>When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,</span><br/>
<span id='945'>Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit;</span><br/>
<span id='946'>Tu-who, a merry note,</span><br/>

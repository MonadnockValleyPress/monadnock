<h1>As You Like It</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene VII</h3>
<h4>The forest.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and Lords like outlaws</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I think he be transform'd into a beast;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>For I can no where find him like a man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>My lord, he is but even now gone hence:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Here was he merry, hearing of a song.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>If he, compact of jars, grow musical,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter JAQUES</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>He saves my labour by his own approach.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>That your poor friends must woo your company?</span><br/>
<span id='11'>What, you look merrily!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>JAQUES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>A motley fool; a miserable world!</span><br/>
<span id='14'>As I do live by food, I met a fool</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>In good set terms and yet a motley fool.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And then he drew a dial from his poke,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear</span><br/>
<span id='29'>The motley fool thus moral on the time,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>That fools should be so deep-contemplative,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And I did laugh sans intermission</span><br/>
<span id='33'>An hour by his dial. O noble fool!</span><br/>
<span id='34'>A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>What fool is this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>JAQUES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And says, if ladies be but young and fair,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit</span><br/>
<span id='40'>After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd</span><br/>
<span id='41'>With observation, the which he vents</span><br/>
<span id='42'>In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!</span><br/>
<span id='43'>I am ambitious for a motley coat.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Thou shalt have one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>JAQUES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>It is my only suit;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Provided that you weed your better judgments</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Of all opinion that grows rank in them</span><br/>
<span id='48'>That I am wise. I must have liberty</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Withal, as large a charter as the wind,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And they that are most galled with my folly,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?</span><br/>
<span id='53'>The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>He that a fool doth very wisely hit</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Doth very foolishly, although he smart,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>The wise man's folly is anatomized</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Even by the squandering glances of the fool.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Invest me in my motley; give me leave</span><br/>
<span id='60'>To speak my mind, and I will through and through</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>If they will patiently receive my medicine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>JAQUES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>What, for a counter, would I do but good?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>For thou thyself hast been a libertine,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>As sensual as the brutish sting itself;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And all the embossed sores and headed evils,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>JAQUES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Why, who cries out on pride,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>That can therein tax any private party?</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Till that the weary very means do ebb?</span><br/>
<span id='75'>What woman in the city do I name,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>When that I say the city-woman bears</span><br/>
<span id='77'>The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Who can come in and say that I mean her,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>When such a one as she such is her neighbour?</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Or what is he of basest function</span><br/>
<span id='81'>That says his bravery is not of my cost,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits</span><br/>
<span id='83'>His folly to the mettle of my speech?</span><br/>
<span id='84'>There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein</span><br/>
<span id='85'>My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Forbear, and eat no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>JAQUES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Why, I have eat none yet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>JAQUES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Of what kind should this cock come of?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Or else a rude despiser of good manners,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>That in civility thou seem'st so empty?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>He dies that touches any of this fruit</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Till I and my affairs are answered.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>JAQUES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>What would you have? Your gentleness shall force</span><br/>
<span id='104'>More than your force move us to gentleness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>I almost die for food; and let me have it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>I thought that all things had been savage here;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And therefore put I on the countenance</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are</span><br/>
<span id='111'>That in this desert inaccessible,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Under the shade of melancholy boughs,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time</span><br/>
<span id='114'>If ever you have look'd on better days,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>If ever sat at any good man's feast,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear</span><br/>
<span id='118'>And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:</span><br/>
<span id='120'>In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>True is it that we have seen better days,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church</span><br/>
<span id='123'>And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And therefore sit you down in gentleness</span><br/>
<span id='126'>And take upon command what help we have</span><br/>
<span id='127'>That to your wanting may be minister'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Then but forbear your food a little while,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And give it food. There is an old poor man,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Who after me hath many a weary step</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>I will not touch a bit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Go find him out,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And we will nothing waste till you return.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:</span><br/>
<span id='139'>This wide and universal theatre</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Presents more woeful pageants than the scene</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Wherein we play in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>JAQUES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>All the world's a stage,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>And all the men and women merely players:</span><br/>
<span id='144'>They have their exits and their entrances;</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And one man in his time plays many parts,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.</span><br/>
<span id='148'>And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel</span><br/>
<span id='149'>And shining morning face, creeping like snail</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Seeking the bubble reputation</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>In fair round belly with good capon lined,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Full of wise saws and modern instances;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide</span><br/>
<span id='164'>For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Turning again toward childish treble, pipes</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>That ends this strange eventful history,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Is second childishness and mere oblivion,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>And let him feed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>ORLANDO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>I thank you most for him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>ADAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>So had you need:</span><br/>
<span id='174'>I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you</span><br/>
<span id='176'>As yet, to question you about your fortunes.</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.</span><br/>
<span id='178'>SONG.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>AMIENS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Blow, blow, thou winter wind.</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Thou art not so unkind</span><br/>
<span id='181'>As man's ingratitude;</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Thy tooth is not so keen,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Because thou art not seen,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Although thy breath be rude.</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Then, heigh-ho, the holly!</span><br/>
<span id='188'>This life is most jolly.</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>That dost not bite so nigh</span><br/>
<span id='191'>As benefits forgot:</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Though thou the waters warp,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Thy sting is not so sharp</span><br/>
<span id='194'>As friend remember'd not.</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Heigh-ho! sing,  & c.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>DUKE SENIOR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>And as mine eye doth his effigies witness</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Most truly limn'd and living in your face,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke</span><br/>
<span id='201'>That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Thou art right welcome as thy master is.</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>And let me all your fortunes understand.</span><br/>

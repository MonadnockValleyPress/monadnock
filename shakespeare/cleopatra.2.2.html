<h1>Antony and Cleopatra</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Rome. The house of Lepidus.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And shall become you well, to entreat your captain</span><br/>
<span id='3'>To soft and gentle speech.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>I shall entreat him</span><br/>
<span id='5'>To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Let Antony look over Caesar's head</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>I would not shave't to-day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>'Tis not a time</span><br/>
<span id='11'>For private stomaching.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Every time</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Serves for the matter that is then born in't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>But small to greater matters must give way.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Not if the small come first.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Your speech is passion:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes</span><br/>
<span id='18'>The noble Antony.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>                  And yonder, Caesar.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>If we compose well here, to Parthia:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Hark, Ventidius.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>                  I do not know,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Noble friends,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>That which combined us was most great, and let not</span><br/>
<span id='26'>A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>May it be gently heard: when we debate</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Our trivial difference loud, we do commit</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>The rather, for I earnestly beseech,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Nor curstness grow to the matter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>'Tis spoken well.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Were we before our armies, and to fight.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>I should do thus.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Welcome to Rome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>                  Thank you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Sit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Sit, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Nay, then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>I learn, you take things ill which are not so,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Or being, concern you not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>I must be laugh'd at,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>If, or for nothing or a little, I</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Should say myself offended, and with you</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I should</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Once name you derogately, when to sound your name</span><br/>
<span id='48'>It not concern'd me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>My being in Egypt, Caesar,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>What was't to you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>No more than my residing here at Rome</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Might be my question.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>How intend you, practised?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>You may be pleased to catch at mine intent</span><br/>
<span id='57'>By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Made wars upon me; and their contestation</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Was theme for you, you were the word of war.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>You do mistake your business; my brother never</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And have my learning from some true reports,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Discredit my authority with yours;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And make the wars alike against my stomach,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Having alike your cause? Of this my letters</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>As matter whole you have not to make it with,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>It must not be with this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>You praise yourself</span><br/>
<span id='71'>By laying defects of judgment to me; but</span><br/>
<span id='72'>You patch'd up your excuses.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Not so, not so;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Very necessity of this thought, that I,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>I would you had her spirit in such another:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle</span><br/>
<span id='81'>You may pace easy, but not such a wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Would we had all such wives, that the men might go</span><br/>
<span id='83'>to wars with the women!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Made out of her impatience, which not wanted</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Did you too much disquiet: for that you must</span><br/>
<span id='88'>But say, I could not help it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>I wrote to you</span><br/>
<span id='90'>When rioting in Alexandria; you</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Did gibe my missive out of audience.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Sir,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>He fell upon me ere admitted: then</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Of what I was i' the morning: but next day</span><br/>
<span id='97'>I told him of myself; which was as much</span><br/>
<span id='98'>As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Out of our question wipe him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>You have broken</span><br/>
<span id='102'>The article of your oath; which you shall never</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Have tongue to charge me with.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Soft, Caesar!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>No,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Lepidus, let him speak:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>The honour is sacred which he talks on now,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;</span><br/>
<span id='109'>The article of my oath.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>To lend me arms and aid when I required them;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>The which you both denied.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Neglected, rather;</span><br/>
<span id='113'>And then when poison'd hours had bound me up</span><br/>
<span id='114'>From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>For which myself, the ignorant motive, do</span><br/>
<span id='120'>So far ask pardon as befits mine honour</span><br/>
<span id='121'>To stoop in such a case.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>'Tis noble spoken.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MECAENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>If it might please you, to enforce no further</span><br/>
<span id='124'>The griefs between ye: to forget them quite</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Were to remember that the present need</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Speaks to atone you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Or, if you borrow one another's love for the</span><br/>
<span id='129'>instant, you may, when you hear no more words of</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to</span><br/>
<span id='131'>wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Go to, then; your considerate stone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>I do not much dislike the matter, but</span><br/>
<span id='137'>The manner of his speech; for't cannot be</span><br/>
<span id='138'>We shall remain in friendship, our conditions</span><br/>
<span id='139'>So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew</span><br/>
<span id='140'>What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge</span><br/>
<span id='141'>O' the world I would pursue it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>AGRIPPA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Give me leave, Caesar,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Speak, Agrippa.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>AGRIPPA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Is now a widower.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>                  Say not so, Agrippa:</span><br/>
<span id='148'>If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Were well deserved of rashness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>I am not married, Caesar: let me hear</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Agrippa further speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>AGRIPPA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>To hold you in perpetual amity,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts</span><br/>
<span id='154'>With an unslipping  knot, take Antony</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims</span><br/>
<span id='156'>No worse a husband than the best of men;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Whose virtue and whose general graces speak</span><br/>
<span id='158'>That which none else can utter. By this marriage,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>All little jealousies, which now seem great,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>And all great fears, which now import their dangers,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Where now half tales be truths: her love to both</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Would, each to other and all loves to both,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;</span><br/>
<span id='165'>For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>By duty ruminated.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>                  Will Caesar speak?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd</span><br/>
<span id='169'>With what is spoke already.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>What power is in Agrippa,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'</span><br/>
<span id='172'>To make this good?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>                  The power of Caesar, and</span><br/>
<span id='174'>His power unto Octavia.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<span id='175'>May I never</span><br/>
<span id='176'>To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Further this act of grace: and from this hour</span><br/>
<span id='179'>The heart of brothers govern in our loves</span><br/>
<span id='180'>And sway our great designs!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>There is my hand.</span><br/>
<span id='182'>A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Did ever love so dearly: let her live</span><br/>
<span id='184'>To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Fly off our loves again!</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='186'>Happily, amen!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;</span><br/>
<span id='188'>For he hath laid strange courtesies and great</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Of late upon me: I must thank him only,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;</span><br/>
<span id='191'>At heel of that, defy him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>LEPIDUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Time calls upon's:</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Of us must Pompey presently be sought,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Or else he seeks out us.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='195'>Where lies he?</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='197'>What is his strength by land?</span><br/>

<span id='speech63'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>

<span id='speech64'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>So is the fame.</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>

<span id='204'>With most gladness:</span><br/>
<span id='205'>And do invite you to my sister's view,</span><br/>

<span id='227'>There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised</span><br/>

<span id='229'>I will tell you.</span><br/>
<span id='230'>The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;</span><br/>
<span id='232'>Purple the sails, and so perfumed that</span><br/>
<span id='233'>The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,</span><br/>
<span id='234'>Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made</span><br/>
<span id='235'>The water which they beat to follow faster,</span><br/>
<span id='236'>As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,</span><br/>
<span id='237'>It beggar'd all description: she did lie</span><br/>
<span id='238'>In her pavilion&mdash;cloth-of-gold of tissue&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='239'>O'er-picturing that Venus where we see</span><br/>
<span id='240'>The fancy outwork nature: on each side her</span><br/>
<span id='241'>Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,</span><br/>
<span id='242'>With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem</span><br/>
<span id='243'>To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,</span><br/>
<span id='244'>And what they undid did.</span><br/>

<span id='246'>Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,</span><br/>
<span id='247'>So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='248'>And made their bends adornings: at the helm</span><br/>
<span id='249'>A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle</span><br/>
<span id='250'>Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,</span><br/>
<span id='251'>That yarely frame the office. From the barge</span><br/>
<span id='252'>A strange invisible perfume hits the sense</span><br/>
<span id='253'>Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast</span><br/>
<span id='254'>Her people out upon her; and Antony,</span><br/>
<span id='255'>Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,</span><br/>
<span id='256'>Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,</span><br/>
<span id='257'>Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,</span><br/>
<span id='258'>And made a gap in nature.</span><br/>

<span id='260'>Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,</span><br/>
<span id='261'>Invited her to supper: she replied,</span><br/>
<span id='262'>It should be better he became her guest;</span><br/>

<span id='264'>Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,</span><br/>
<span id='265'>Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,</span><br/>

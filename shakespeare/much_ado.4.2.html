</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>VERGES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>O, a stool and a cushion for the sexton.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Sexton</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Which be the malefactors?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Marry, that am I and my partner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>VERGES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Nay, that's certain; we have the exhibition to examine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Sexton</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>But which are the offenders that are to be</span><br/>
<span id='7'>examined? let them come before master constable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your</span><br/>
<span id='9'>name, friend?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Borachio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Pray, write down, Borachio. Yours, sirrah?</span><br/>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Write down, master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do</span><br/>
<span id='14'>you serve God?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Yea, sir, we hope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Write down, that they hope they serve God: and</span><br/>
<span id='17'>write God first; for God defend but God should go</span><br/>
<span id='18'>before such villains! Masters, it is proved already</span><br/>
<span id='19'>that you are little better than false knaves; and it</span><br/>
<span id='20'>will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer</span><br/>
<span id='21'>you for yourselves?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Marry, sir, we say we are none.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you: but I</span><br/>
<span id='24'>will go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a</span><br/>
<span id='25'>word in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thought</span><br/>
<span id='26'>you are false knaves.</span><br/>

<span id='27'>Sir, I say to you we are none.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Well, stand aside. 'Fore God, they are both in a</span><br/>
<span id='29'>tale. Have you writ down, that they are none?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Sexton</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Master constable, you go not the way to examine:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Yea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watch</span><br/>
<span id='33'>come forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince's</span><br/>
<span id='34'>name, accuse these men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>First Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>This man said, sir, that Don John, the prince's</span><br/>
<span id='36'>brother, was a villain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat</span><br/>
<span id='38'>perjury, to call a prince's brother villain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Master constable,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>I promise thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Sexton</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>What heard you him say else?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Second Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Flat burglary as ever was committed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>VERGES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Yea, by mass, that it is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Sexton</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>What else, fellow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>First Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to</span><br/>
<span id='49'>disgrace Hero before the whole assembly. and not marry her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting</span><br/>
<span id='51'>redemption for this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Sexton</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>What else?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Watchman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>This is all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Sexton</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>And this is more, masters, than you can deny.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner</span><br/>
<span id='57'>refused, and upon the grief of this suddenly died.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Master constable, let these men be bound, and</span><br/>
<span id='59'>brought to Leonato's: I will go before and show</span><br/>
<span id='60'>him their examination.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Come, let them be opinioned.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>VERGES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Let them be in the hands&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Off, coxcomb!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>God's my life, where's the sexton? let him write</span><br/>
<span id='65'>down the prince's officer coxcomb. Come, bind them.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Thou naughty varlet!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DOGBERRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not</span><br/>
<span id='69'>suspect my years? O that he were here to write me</span><br/>
<span id='70'>down an ass! But, masters, remember that I am an</span><br/>
<span id='71'>ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not</span><br/>
<span id='72'>that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of</span><br/>
<span id='73'>piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>and, which is more, a householder, and, which is</span><br/>
<span id='76'>more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Messina, and one that knows the law, go to; and a</span><br/>
<span id='78'>rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath</span><br/>
<span id='79'>had losses, and one that hath two gowns and every</span><br/>
<span id='80'>thing handsome about him. Bring him away. O that</span><br/>
<span id='81'>I had been writ down an ass!</span><br/>

<h1>King Lear</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Before Albany's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GONERIL and EDMUND</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Not met us on the way.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter OSWALD</em></p>
<span id='3'>Now, where's your master'?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Madam, within; but never man so changed.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I told him of the army that was landed;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And of the loyal service of his son,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>What like, offensive.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>[To EDMUND]  Then shall you go no further.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>It is the cowish terror of his spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way</span><br/>
<span id='17'>May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I must change arms at home, and give the distaff</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>If you dare venture in your own behalf,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;</span><br/>
<p><em>Giving a favour</em></p>
<span id='24'>Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Conceive, and fare thee well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Yours in the ranks of death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>My most dear Gloucester!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit EDMUND</em></p>
<span id='29'>O, the difference of man and man!</span><br/>
<span id='30'>To thee a woman's services are due:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>My fool usurps my body.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>OSWALD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Madam, here comes my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter ALBANY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>I have been worth the whistle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>O Goneril!</span><br/>
<span id='35'>You are not worth the dust which the rude wind</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>That nature, which contemns its origin,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Cannot be border'd certain in itself;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>She that herself will sliver and disbranch</span><br/>
<span id='40'>From her material sap, perforce must wither</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And come to deadly use.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>No more; the text is foolish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?</span><br/>
<span id='46'>A father, and a gracious aged man,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Could my good brother suffer you to do it?</span><br/>
<span id='50'>A man, a prince, by him so benefited!</span><br/>
<span id='51'>If that the heavens do not their visible spirits</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>It will come,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Humanity must perforce prey on itself,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Like monsters of the deep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Milk-liver'd man!</span><br/>
<span id='57'>That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?</span><br/>
<span id='62'>France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest</span><br/>
<span id='65'>'Alack, why does he so?'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>See thyself, devil!</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Proper deformity seems not in the fiend</span><br/>
<span id='68'>So horrid as in woman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>O vain fool!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness</span><br/>
<span id='72'>To let these hands obey my blood,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>They are apt enough to dislocate and tear</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>A woman's shape doth shield thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Marry, your manhood now&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>What news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Slain by his servant, going to put out</span><br/>
<span id='80'>The other eye of Gloucester.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Gloucester's eye!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Opposed against the act, bending his sword</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To his great master; who, thereat enraged,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>But not without that harmful stroke, which since</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Hath pluck'd him after.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>This shows you are above,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>You justicers, that these our nether crimes</span><br/>
<span id='90'>So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Lost he his other eye?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Both, both, my lord.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>'Tis from your sister.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>[Aside]              One way I like this well;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>May all the building in my fancy pluck</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Upon my hateful life: another way,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>The news is not so tart.&mdash;I'll read, and answer.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Where was his son when they did take his eyes?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Come with my lady hither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>He is not here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>No, my good lord; I met him back again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Knows he the wickedness?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Ay, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Might have the freer course.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ALBANY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Gloucester, I live</span><br/>
<span id='109'>To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Tell me what more thou know'st.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

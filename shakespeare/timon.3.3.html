<h1>Timon of Athens</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene III</h3>
<h4>A room in Sempronius' house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter SEMPRONIUS, and a Servant of TIMON's</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SEMPRONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Must he needs trouble me in 't,&mdash;hum!&mdash;'bove</span><br/>
<span id='2'>all others?</span><br/>
<span id='3'>He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And now Ventidius is wealthy too,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Whom he redeem'd from prison: all these</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Owe their estates unto him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>My lord,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for</span><br/>
<span id='9'>They have au denied him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SEMPRONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>How! have they denied him?</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And does he send to me? Three? hum!</span><br/>
<span id='13'>It shows but little love or judgment in him:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like</span><br/>
<span id='15'>physicians,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>But his occasion might have woo'd me first;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>For, in my conscience, I was the first man</span><br/>
<span id='21'>That e'er received gift from him:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And does he think so backwardly of me now,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>That I'll requite its last? No:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>So it may prove an argument of laughter</span><br/>
<span id='25'>To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And with their faint reply this answer join;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The</span><br/>
<span id='32'>devil knew not what he did when he made man</span><br/>
<span id='33'>politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot</span><br/>
<span id='34'>think but, in the end, the villainies of man will</span><br/>
<span id='35'>set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to</span><br/>
<span id='36'>appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>like those that under hot ardent zeal would set</span><br/>
<span id='38'>whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his</span><br/>
<span id='39'>politic love.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Many a bounteous year must be employ'd</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Now to guard sure their master.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And this is all a liberal course allows;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

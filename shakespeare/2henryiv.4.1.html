<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</H3>
<h4>Yorkshire. Gaultree Forest.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, MOWBRAY, LORD HASTINGS, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>What is this forest call'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>'Tis Gaultree Forest, an't shall please your grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Here stand, my lords; and send discoverers forth</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To know the numbers of our enemies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>We have sent forth already.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>'Tis well done.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>My friends and brethren in these great affairs,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>I must acquaint you that I have received</span><br/>
<span id='9'>New-dated letters from Northumberland;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Their cold intent, tenor and substance, thus:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Here doth he wish his person, with such powers</span><br/>
<span id='12'>As might hold sortance with his quality,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The which he could not levy; whereupon</span><br/>
<span id='14'>He is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>To Scotland: and concludes in hearty prayers</span><br/>
<span id='16'>That your attempts may overlive the hazard</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And fearful melting of their opposite.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And dash themselves to pieces.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Now, what news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>In goodly form comes on the enemy;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>The just proportion that we gave them out</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Let us sway on and face them in the field.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>What well-appointed leader fronts us here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter WESTMORELAND</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Health and fair greeting from our general,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>What doth concern your coming?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Then, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Unto your grace do I in chief address</span><br/>
<span id='35'>The substance of my speech. If that rebellion</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Came like itself, in base and abject routs,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And countenanced by boys and beggary,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>In his true, native and most proper shape,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>You, reverend father, and these noble lords</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Had not been here, to dress the ugly form</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Of base and bloody insurrection</span><br/>
<span id='44'>With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Whose white investments figure innocence,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Wherefore do you so ill translate yourself</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Your pens to lances and your tongue divine</span><br/>
<span id='55'>To a trumpet and a point of war?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And with our surfeiting and wanton hours</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And we must bleed for it; of which disease</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>I take not on me here as a physician,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Nor do I as an enemy to peace</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Troop in the throngs of military men;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>But rather show awhile like fearful war,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>To diet rank minds sick of happiness</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And purge the obstructions which begin to stop</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>I have in equal balance justly weigh'd</span><br/>
<span id='71'>What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And find our griefs heavier than our offences.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>We see which way the stream of time doth run,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And are enforced from our most quiet there</span><br/>
<span id='75'>By the rough torrent of occasion;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And have the summary of all our griefs,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>When time shall serve, to show in articles;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>And might by no suit gain our audience:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>We are denied access unto his person</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Even by those men that most have done us wrong.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>The dangers of the days but newly gone,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Whose memory is written on the earth</span><br/>
<span id='85'>With yet appearing blood, and the examples</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Of every minute's instance, present now,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Not to break peace or any branch of it,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>But to establish here a peace indeed,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Concurring both in name and quality.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>When ever yet was your appeal denied?</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Wherein have you been galled by the king?</span><br/>
<span id='93'>What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>That you should seal this lawless bloody book</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Of forged rebellion with a seal divine</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>My brother general, the commonwealth,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>To brother born an household cruelty,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>I make my quarrel in particular.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>There is no need of any such redress;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Or if there were, it not belongs to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Why not to him in part, and to us all</span><br/>
<span id='103'>That feel the bruises of the days before,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And suffer the condition of these times</span><br/>
<span id='105'>To lay a heavy and unequal hand</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Upon our honours?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>                  O, my good Lord Mowbray,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Construe the times to their necessities,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And you shall say indeed, it is the time,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And not the king, that doth you injuries.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Yet for your part, it not appears to me</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Either from the king or in the present time</span><br/>
<span id='113'>That you should have an inch of any ground</span><br/>
<span id='114'>To build a grief on: were you not restored</span><br/>
<span id='115'>To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Your noble and right well remember'd father's?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>What thing, in honour, had my father lost,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>That need to be revived and breathed in me?</span><br/>
<span id='119'>The king that loved him, as the state stood then,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:</span><br/>
<span id='121'>And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Being mounted and both roused in their seats,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel</span><br/>
<span id='126'>And the loud trumpet blowing them together,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd</span><br/>
<span id='128'>My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>O when the king did throw his warder down,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>His own life hung upon the staff he threw;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Then threw he down himself and all their lives</span><br/>
<span id='132'>That by indictment and by dint of sword</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.</span><br/>
<span id='135'>The Earl of Hereford was reputed then</span><br/>
<span id='136'>In England the most valiant gentlemen:</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?</span><br/>
<span id='138'>But if your father had been victor there,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:</span><br/>
<span id='140'>For all the country in a general voice</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on</span><br/>
<span id='143'>And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.</span><br/>
<span id='144'>But this is mere digression from my purpose.</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Here come I from our princely general</span><br/>
<span id='146'>To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace</span><br/>
<span id='147'>That he will give you audience; and wherein</span><br/>
<span id='148'>It shall appear that your demands are just,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>You shall enjoy them, every thing set off</span><br/>
<span id='150'>That might so much as think you enemies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>But he hath forced us to compel this offer;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>And it proceeds from policy, not love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Mowbray, you overween to take it so;</span><br/>
<span id='154'>This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:</span><br/>
<span id='155'>For, lo! within a ken our army lies,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Upon mine honour, all too confident</span><br/>
<span id='157'>To give admittance to a thought of fear.</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Our battle is more full of names than yours,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Our men more perfect in the use of arms,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Then reason will our heart should be as good</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Say you not then our offer is compell'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>That argues but the shame of your offence:</span><br/>
<span id='165'>A rotten case abides no handling.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Hath the Prince John a full commission,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>In very ample virtue of his father,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>To hear and absolutely to determine</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Of what conditions we shall stand upon?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>That is intended in the general's name:</span><br/>
<span id='171'>I muse you make so slight a question.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>For this contains our general grievances:</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Each several article herein redress'd,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>All members of our cause, both here and hence,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>That are insinew'd to this action,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Acquitted by a true substantial form</span><br/>
<span id='178'>And present execution of our wills</span><br/>
<span id='179'>To us and to our purposes confined,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>We come within our awful banks again</span><br/>
<span id='181'>And knit our powers to the arm of peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>This will I show the general. Please you, lords,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>In sight of both our battles we may meet;</span><br/>
<span id='184'>And either end in peace, which God so frame!</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Or to the place of difference call the swords</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Which must decide it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>My lord, we will do so.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit WESTMORELAND</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>There is a thing within my bosom tells me</span><br/>
<span id='189'>That no conditions of our peace can stand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>Fear you not that: if we can make our peace</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Upon such large terms and so absolute</span><br/>
<span id='192'>As our conditions shall consist upon,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>Yea, but our valuation shall be such</span><br/>
<span id='195'>That every slight and false-derived cause,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reason</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Shall to the king taste of this action;</span><br/>
<span id='198'>That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind</span><br/>
<span id='200'>That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff</span><br/>
<span id='201'>And good from bad find no partition.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Of dainty and such picking grievances:</span><br/>
<span id='204'>For he hath found to end one doubt by death</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Revives two greater in the heirs of life,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>And therefore will he wipe his tables clean</span><br/>
<span id='207'>And keep no tell-tale to his memory</span><br/>
<span id='208'>That may repeat and history his loss</span><br/>
<span id='209'>To new remembrance; for full well he knows</span><br/>
<span id='210'>He cannot so precisely weed this land</span><br/>
<span id='211'>As his misdoubts present occasion:</span><br/>
<span id='212'>His foes are so enrooted with his friends</span><br/>
<span id='213'>That, plucking to unfix an enemy,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:</span><br/>
<span id='215'>So that this land, like an offensive wife</span><br/>
<span id='216'>That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,</span><br/>
<span id='217'>As he is striking, holds his infant up</span><br/>
<span id='218'>And hangs resolved correction in the arm</span><br/>
<span id='219'>That was uprear'd to execution.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='220'>Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods</span><br/>
<span id='221'>On late offenders, that he now doth lack</span><br/>
<span id='222'>The very instruments of chastisement:</span><br/>
<span id='223'>So that his power, like to a fangless lion,</span><br/>
<span id='224'>May offer, but not hold.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='225'>'Tis very true:</span><br/>
<span id='226'>And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,</span><br/>
<span id='227'>If we do now make our atonement well,</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Our peace will, like a broken limb united,</span><br/>
<span id='229'>Grow stronger for the breaking.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='230'>Be it so.</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter WESTMORELAND</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='232'>The prince is here at hand: pleaseth your lordship</span><br/>
<span id='233'>To meet his grace just distance 'tween our armies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MOWBRAY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='234'>Your grace of York, in God's name then, set forward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='235'>Before, and greet his grace: my lord, we come.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene V</h3>
<h4>Pentapolis. A room in the palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter SIMONIDES, reading a letter, at one door: the Knights meet him</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Knight</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Good morrow to the good Simonides.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Knights, from my daughter this I let you know,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>That for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake</span><br/>
<span id='4'>A married life.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Her reason to herself is only known,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Which yet from her by no means can I get.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Knight</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>May we not get access to her, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>'Faith, by no means; she has so strictly tied</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Her to her chamber, that 'tis impossible.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vow'd</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And on her virgin honour will not break it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Third Knight</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Knights</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>So,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>They are well dispatch'd; now to my daughter's letter:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>She tells me here, she'd wed the stranger knight,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Or never more to view nor day nor light.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>'Tis well, mistress; your choice agrees with mine;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I like that well: nay, how absolute she's in't,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Not minding whether I dislike or no!</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Well, I do commend her choice;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And will no longer have it be delay'd.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Soft! here he comes: I must dissemble it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PERICLES</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>All fortune to the good Simonides!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>To you as much, sir! I am beholding to you</span><br/>
<span id='26'>For your sweet music this last night: I do</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Protest my ears were never better fed</span><br/>
<span id='28'>With such delightful pleasing harmony.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>It is your grace's pleasure to commend;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Not my desert.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Sir, you are music's master.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>The worst of all her scholars, my good lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Let me ask you one thing:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>What do you think of my daughter, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>A most virtuous princess.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>And she is fair too, is she not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>As a fair day in summer, wondrous fair.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Ay, so well, that you must be her master,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And she will be your scholar: therefore look to it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>She thinks not so; peruse this writing else.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>[Aside]  What's here?</span><br/>
<span id='44'>A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!</span><br/>
<span id='45'>'Tis the king's subtlety to have my life.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>A stranger and distressed gentleman,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>That never aim'd so high to love your daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>But bent all offices to honour her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter, and thou art</span><br/>
<span id='51'>A villain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>By the gods, I have not:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Never did thought of mine levy offence;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Nor never did my actions yet commence</span><br/>
<span id='55'>A deed might gain her love or your displeasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Traitor, thou liest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Traitor!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Ay, traitor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Even in his throat&mdash;unless it be the king&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>That calls me traitor, I return the lie.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>[Aside]  Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>My actions are as noble as my thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>That never relish'd of a base descent.</span><br/>
<span id='64'>I came unto your court for honour's cause,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And not to be a rebel to her state;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And he that otherwise accounts of me,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>This sword shall prove he's honour's enemy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>No?</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Here comes my daughter, she can witness it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter THAISA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Then, as you are as virtuous as fair,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Resolve your angry father, if my tongue</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Did ere solicit, or my hand subscribe</span><br/>
<span id='73'>To any syllable that made love to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Why, sir, say if you had,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Who takes offence at that would make me glad?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory?</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='77'>I am glad on't with all my heart.&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>I'll tame you; I'll bring you in subjection.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Will you, not having my consent,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Bestow your love and your affections</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Upon a stranger?</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='82'>who, for aught I know,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>May be, nor can I think the contrary,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>As great in blood as I myself.&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Therefore hear you, mistress; either frame</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Your will to mine,&mdash;and you, sir, hear you,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Either be ruled by me, or I will make you&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Man and wife:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And being join'd, I'll thus your hopes destroy;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And for a further grief,&mdash;God give you joy!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>What, are you both pleased?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>THAISA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Yes, if you love me, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>PERICLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Even as my life, or blood that fosters it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>What, are you both agreed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BOTH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Yes, if it please your majesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>SIMONIDES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>It pleaseth me so well, that I will see you wed;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And then with what haste you can get you to bed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
<blockquote>
<em>Enter GOWER</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>GOWER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Now sleep y-slaked hath the rout;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>No din but snores the house about,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Made louder by the o'er-fed breast</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Of this most pompous marriage-feast.</span><br/>
<span id='103'>The cat, with eyne of burning coal,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Now crouches fore the mouse's hole;</span><br/>
<span id='105'>And crickets sing at the oven's mouth,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>E'er the blither for their drouth.</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Hymen hath brought the bride to bed.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Where, by the loss of maidenhead,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>A babe is moulded. Be attent,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And time that is so briefly spent</span><br/>
<span id='111'>With your fine fancies quaintly eche:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.</span><br/>
<p>DUMB SHOW.</p>
<p><em>Enter, PERICLES and SIMONIDES at one door, with  Attendants; a Messenger meets them, kneels, and  gives PERICLES a letter: PERICLES shows it  SIMONIDES; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter  THAISA with child, with LYCHORIDA a nurse. The  KING shows her the letter; she rejoices: she and  PERICLES takes leave of her father, and depart with  LYCHORIDA and their Attendants. Then exeunt SIMONIDES and the rest</em></p>
<span id='113'>By many a dern and painful perch</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Of Pericles the careful search,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>By the four opposing coigns</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Which the world together joins,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Is made with all due diligence</span><br/>
<span id='118'>That horse and sail and high expense</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Fame answering the most strange inquire,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>To the court of King Simonides</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Are letters brought, the tenor these:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Antiochus and his daughter dead;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>The men of Tyrus on the head</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Of Helicanus would set on</span><br/>
<span id='126'>The crown of Tyre, but he will none:</span><br/>
<span id='127'>The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Says to 'em, if King Pericles</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Come not home in twice six moons,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>He, obedient to their dooms,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Will take the crown. The sum of this,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Brought hither to Pentapolis,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Y-ravished the regions round,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>And every one with claps can sound,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>'Our heir-apparent is a king!</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>His queen with child makes her desire&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Which who shall cross?&mdash;along to go:</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Omit we all their dole and woe:</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>And so to sea. Their vessel shakes</span><br/>
<span id='143'>On Neptune's billow; half the flood</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Hath their keel cut: but fortune's mood</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Varies again; the grisly north</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Disgorges such a tempest forth,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>That, as a duck for life that dives,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>So up and down the poor ship drives:</span><br/>
<span id='149'>The lady shrieks, and well-a-near</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Does fall in travail with her fear:</span><br/>
<span id='151'>And what ensues in this fell storm</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Shall for itself itself perform.</span><br/>
<span id='153'>I nill relate, action may</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Conveniently the rest convey;</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Which might not what by me is told.</span><br/>
<span id='156'>In your imagination hold</span><br/>
<span id='157'>This stage the ship, upon whose deck</span><br/>
<span id='158'>The sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

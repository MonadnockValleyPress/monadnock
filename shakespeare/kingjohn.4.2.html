<h1>King John</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene II</h3>
<h4>King John's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING JOHN, PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and other Lords</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PEMBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Fresh expectation troubled not the land</span><br/>
<span id='8'>With any long'd-for change or better state.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To guard a title that was rich before,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>To throw a perfume on the violet,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>To smooth the ice, or add another hue</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light</span><br/>
<span id='15'>To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PEMBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>But that your royal pleasure must be done,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>This act is as an ancient tale new told,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And in the last repeating troublesome,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Being urged at a time unseasonable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>In this the antique and well noted face</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Of plain old form is much disfigured;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Startles and frights consideration,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PEMBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>When workmen strive to do better than well,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>They do confound their skill in covetousness;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And oftentimes excusing of a fault</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>As patches set upon a little breach</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Discredit more in hiding of the fault</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>To this effect, before you were new crown'd,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness</span><br/>
<span id='37'>To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Since all and every part of what we would</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Doth make a stand at what your highness will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Some reasons of this double coronation</span><br/>
<span id='41'>I have possess'd you with and think them strong;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>I shall indue you with: meantime but ask</span><br/>
<span id='44'>What you would have reform'd that is not well,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And well shall you perceive how willingly</span><br/>
<span id='46'>I will both hear and grant you your requests.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PEMBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>To sound the purpose of all their hearts,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Your safety, for the which myself and them</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Bend their best studies, heartily request</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent</span><br/>
<span id='54'>To break into this dangerous argument,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>If what in rest you have in right you hold,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend</span><br/>
<span id='57'>The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Your tender kinsman and to choke his days</span><br/>
<span id='59'>With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth</span><br/>
<span id='60'>The rich advantage of good exercise?</span><br/>
<span id='61'>That the time's enemies may not have this</span><br/>
<span id='62'>To grace occasions, let it be our suit</span><br/>
<span id='63'>That you have bid us ask his liberty;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Which for our goods we do no further ask</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Counts it your weal he have his liberty.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HUBERT</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Let it be so: I do commit his youth</span><br/>
<span id='68'>To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?</span><br/>
<p><em>Taking him apart</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PEMBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>This is the man should do the bloody deed;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>The image of a wicked heinous fault</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>The colour of the king doth come and go</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Between his purpose and his conscience,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PEMBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence</span><br/>
<span id='81'>The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Good lords, although my will to give is living,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>The suit which you demand is gone and dead:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PEMBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Indeed we heard how near his death he was</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Before the child himself felt he was sick:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>This must be answer'd either here or hence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Think you I bear the shears of destiny?</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Have I commandment on the pulse of life?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame</span><br/>
<span id='94'>That greatness should so grossly offer it:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PEMBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And find the inheritance of this poor child,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>His little kingdom of a forced grave.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!</span><br/>
<span id='101'>This must not be thus borne: this will break out</span><br/>
<span id='102'>To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Lords</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>They burn in indignation. I repent:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>There is no sure foundation set on blood,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>No certain life achieved by others' death.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
<span id='106'>A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood</span><br/>
<span id='107'>That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?</span><br/>
<span id='108'>So foul a sky clears not without a storm:</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>From France to England. Never such a power</span><br/>
<span id='111'>For any foreign preparation</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Was levied in the body of a land.</span><br/>
<span id='113'>The copy of your speed is learn'd by them;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>For when you should be told they do prepare,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>The tidings come that they are all arrived.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>That such an army could be drawn in France,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And she not hear of it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>My liege, her ear</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Is stopp'd with dust; the first of April died</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Your noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>The Lady Constance in a frenzy died</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue</span><br/>
<span id='125'>I idly heard; if true or false I know not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!</span><br/>
<span id='127'>O, make a league with me, till I have pleased</span><br/>
<span id='128'>My discontented peers! What! mother dead!</span><br/>
<span id='129'>How wildly then walks my estate in France!</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Under whose conduct came those powers of France</span><br/>
<span id='131'>That thou for truth givest out are landed here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Under the Dauphin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>                  Thou hast made me giddy</span><br/>
<span id='134'>With these ill tidings.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the BASTARD and PETER of Pomfret</em></p>
<span id='135'>Now, what says the world</span><br/>
<span id='136'>To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff</span><br/>
<span id='137'>My head with more ill news, for it is full.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>But if you be afeard to hear the worst,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Under the tide: but now I breathe again</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Aloft the flood, and can give audience</span><br/>
<span id='143'>To any tongue, speak it of what it will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>How I have sped among the clergymen,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>The sums I have collected shall express.</span><br/>
<span id='146'>But as I travell'd hither through the land,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>I find the people strangely fantasied;</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:</span><br/>
<span id='150'>And here a prophet, that I brought with me</span><br/>
<span id='151'>From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found</span><br/>
<span id='152'>With many hundreds treading on his heels;</span><br/>
<span id='153'>To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Your highness should deliver up your crown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>PETER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>Hubert, away with him; imprison him;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And on that day at noon whereon he says</span><br/>
<span id='160'>I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd.</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Deliver him to safety; and return,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>For I must use thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt HUBERT with PETER</em></p>
<span id='163'>O my gentle cousin,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>And others more, going to seek the grave</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Of Arthur, who they say is kill'd to-night</span><br/>
<span id='170'>On your suggestion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Gentle kinsman, go,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And thrust thyself into their companies:</span><br/>
<span id='173'>I have a way to win their loves again;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Bring them before me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>I will seek them out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.</span><br/>
<span id='177'>O, let me have no subject enemies,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>When adverse foreigners affright my towns</span><br/>
<span id='179'>With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>And fly like thought from them to me again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Go after him; for he perhaps shall need</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;</span><br/>
<span id='186'>And be thou he.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>                  With all my heart, my liege.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>My mother dead!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter HUBERT</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about</span><br/>
<span id='191'>The other four in wondrous motion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Five moons!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>Old men and beldams in the streets</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Do prophesy upon it dangerously:</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:</span><br/>
<span id='196'>And when they talk of him, they shake their heads</span><br/>
<span id='197'>And whisper one another in the ear;</span><br/>
<span id='198'>And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.</span><br/>
<span id='201'>I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Told of a many thousand warlike French</span><br/>
<span id='208'>That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Another lean unwash'd artificer</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='211'>Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?</span><br/>
<span id='213'>Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause</span><br/>
<span id='214'>To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='215'>No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>It is the curse of kings to be attended</span><br/>
<span id='217'>By slaves that take their humours for a warrant</span><br/>
<span id='218'>To break within the bloody house of life,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>And on the winking of authority</span><br/>
<span id='220'>To understand a law, to know the meaning</span><br/>
<span id='221'>Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns</span><br/>
<span id='222'>More upon humour than advised respect.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='223'>Here is your hand and seal for what I did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='224'>O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Witness against us to damnation!</span><br/>
<span id='227'>How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,</span><br/>
<span id='229'>A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,</span><br/>
<span id='230'>Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,</span><br/>
<span id='231'>This murder had not come into my mind:</span><br/>
<span id='232'>But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,</span><br/>
<span id='233'>Finding thee fit for bloody villany,</span><br/>
<span id='234'>Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;</span><br/>
<span id='236'>And thou, to be endeared to a king,</span><br/>
<span id='237'>Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='238'>My lord&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='239'>Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause</span><br/>
<span id='240'>When I spake darkly what I purposed,</span><br/>
<span id='241'>Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,</span><br/>
<span id='242'>As bid me tell my tale in express words,</span><br/>
<span id='243'>Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,</span><br/>
<span id='244'>And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:</span><br/>
<span id='245'>But thou didst understand me by my signs</span><br/>
<span id='246'>And didst in signs again parley with sin;</span><br/>
<span id='247'>Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,</span><br/>
<span id='248'>And consequently thy rude hand to act</span><br/>
<span id='249'>The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.</span><br/>
<span id='250'>Out of my sight, and never see me more!</span><br/>
<span id='251'>My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,</span><br/>
<span id='252'>Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:</span><br/>
<span id='253'>Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,</span><br/>
<span id='254'>This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,</span><br/>
<span id='255'>Hostility and civil tumult reigns</span><br/>
<span id='256'>Between my conscience and my cousin's death.</span><br/>

<span id='speech51'><strong>HUBERT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='257'>Arm you against your other enemies,</span><br/>
<span id='258'>I'll make a peace between your soul and you.</span><br/>
<span id='259'>Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine</span><br/>
<span id='260'>Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,</span><br/>
<span id='261'>Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.</span><br/>
<span id='262'>Within this bosom never enter'd yet</span><br/>
<span id='263'>The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;</span><br/>
<span id='264'>And you have slander'd nature in my form,</span><br/>
<span id='265'>Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,</span><br/>
<span id='266'>Is yet the cover of a fairer mind</span><br/>
<span id='267'>Than to be butcher of an innocent child.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='268'>Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,</span><br/>
<span id='269'>Throw this report on their incensed rage,</span><br/>
<span id='270'>And make them tame to their obedience!</span><br/>
<span id='271'>Forgive the comment that my passion made</span><br/>
<span id='272'>Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,</span><br/>
<span id='273'>And foul imaginary eyes of blood</span><br/>
<span id='274'>Presented thee more hideous than thou art.</span><br/>
<span id='275'>O, answer not, but to my closet bring</span><br/>
<span id='276'>The angry lords with all expedient haste.</span><br/>
<span id='277'>I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

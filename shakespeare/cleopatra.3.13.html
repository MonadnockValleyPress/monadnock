<h1>Antony and Cleopatra</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene XIII</h3>
<h4>Alexandria. Cleopatra's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>What shall we do, Enobarbus?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Think, and die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Is Antony or we in fault for this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Antony only, that would make his will</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Lord of his reason. What though you fled</span><br/>
<span id='6'>From that great face of war, whose several ranges</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Frighted each other? why should he follow?</span><br/>
<span id='8'>The itch of his affection should not then</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>When half to half the world opposed, he being</span><br/>
<span id='11'>The meered question: 'twas a shame no less</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And leave his navy gazing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Prithee, peace.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Is that his answer?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>EUPHRONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Ay, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>The queen shall then have courtesy, so she</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Will yield us up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>EUPHRONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>                  He says so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Let her know't.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And he will fill thy wishes to the brim</span><br/>
<span id='23'>With principalities.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>That head, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>To him again: tell him he wears the rose</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Of youth upon him; from which the world should note</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Something particular: his coin, ships, legions,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Under the service of a child as soon</span><br/>
<span id='30'>As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore</span><br/>
<span id='31'>To lay his gay comparisons apart,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And answer me declined, sword against sword,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>[Aside]  Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are</span><br/>
<span id='37'>A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Do draw the inward quality after them,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To suffer all alike. That he should dream,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued</span><br/>
<span id='42'>His judgment too.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter an Attendant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Attendant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>                  A messenger from CAESAR.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>What, no more ceremony? See, my women!</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Against the blown rose may they stop their nose</span><br/>
<span id='46'>That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Attendant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>[Aside]  Mine honesty and I begin to square.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The loyalty well held to fools does make</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure</span><br/>
<span id='50'>To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Does conquer him that did his master conquer</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And earns a place i' the story.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter THYREUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Caesar's will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>THYREUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Hear it apart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>                  None but friends: say boldly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>THYREUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>So, haply, are they friends to Antony.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>THYREUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>So.</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Further than he is Caesar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Go on: right royal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>THYREUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>He knows that you embrace not Antony</span><br/>
<span id='67'>As you did love, but as you fear'd him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>O!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>THYREUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>The scars upon your honour, therefore, he</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Does pity, as constrained blemishes,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Not as deserved.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>                  He is a god, and knows</span><br/>
<span id='73'>What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>But conquer'd merely.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>[Aside]             To be sure of that,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Thy dearest quit thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>THYREUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Shall I say to Caesar</span><br/>
<span id='80'>What you require of him? for he partly begs</span><br/>
<span id='81'>To be desired to give. It much would please him,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>That of his fortunes you should make a staff</span><br/>
<span id='83'>To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To hear from me you had left Antony,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And put yourself under his shrowd,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>The universal landlord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>What's your name?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>THYREUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>My name is Thyreus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Most kind messenger,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Say to great Caesar this: in deputation</span><br/>
<span id='91'>I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt</span><br/>
<span id='92'>To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear</span><br/>
<span id='94'>The doom of Egypt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>THYREUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>'Tis your noblest course.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Wisdom and fortune combating together,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>If that the former dare but what it can,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay</span><br/>
<span id='99'>My duty on your hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Your Caesar's father oft,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>As it rain'd kisses.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Favours, by Jove that thunders!</span><br/>
<span id='105'>What art thou, fellow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>THYREUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>One that but performs</span><br/>
<span id='107'>The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest</span><br/>
<span id='108'>To have command obey'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>[Aside]               You will be whipp'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods</span><br/>
<span id='111'>and devils!</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Antony yet.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Attendants</em></p>
<span id='116'>Take hence this Jack, and whip him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>[Aside]  'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Than with an old one dying.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Moon and stars!</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries</span><br/>
<span id='121'>That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them</span><br/>
<span id='122'>So saucy with the hand of she here,&mdash;what's her name,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>THYREUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Mark Antony!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>                  Tug him away: being whipp'd,</span><br/>

<p><em>Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS</em></p>
<span id='130'>You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Forborne the getting of a lawful race,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And by a gem of women, to be abused</span><br/>
<span id='134'>By one that looks on feeders?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>

<span id='135'>Good my lord,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>

<span id='136'>You have been a boggler ever:</span><br/>
<span id='137'>But when we in our viciousness grow hard&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='138'>O misery on't!&mdash;the wise gods seel our eyes;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>I found you as a morsel cold upon</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Dead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Though you can guess what temperance should be,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>You know not what it is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CLEOPATRA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Wherefore is this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>

<span id='151'>To let a fellow that will take rewards</span><br/>

<span id='153'>My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal</span><br/>
<span id='154'>And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar</span><br/>
<span id='156'>The horned herd! for I have savage cause;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>And to proclaim it civilly, were like</span><br/>
<span id='158'>A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank</span><br/>
<span id='159'>For being yare about him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS</em></p>

<span id='speech51'><strong>First Attendant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>He did ask favour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>MARK ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>If that thy father live, let him repent</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry</span><br/>
<span id='166'>To follow Caesar in his triumph, since</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth</span><br/>
<span id='168'>The white hand of a lady fever thee,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say</span><br/>
<span id='171'>He makes me angry with him; for he seems</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>When my good stars, that were my former guides,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike</span><br/>
<span id='178'>My speech and what is done, tell him he has</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom</span><br/>
<span id='180'>He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:</span><br/>

<h1>Troilus and Cressida</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, NESTOR, AJAX, MENELAUS, and CALCHAS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CALCHAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now, princes, for the service I have done you,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The advantage of the time prompts me aloud</span><br/>
<span id='3'>To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind</span><br/>
<span id='4'>That, through the sight I bear in things to love,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>From certain and possess'd conveniences,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all</span><br/>
<span id='9'>That time, acquaintance, custom and condition</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Made tame and most familiar to my nature,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And here, to do you service, am become</span><br/>
<span id='12'>As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>I do beseech you, as in way of taste,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>To give me now a little benefit,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Out of those many register'd in promise,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>AGAMEMNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>CALCHAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Oft have you&mdash;often have you thanks therefore&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>I know, is such a wrest in their affairs</span><br/>
<span id='24'>That their negotiations all must slack,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Wanting his manage; and they will almost</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Shall quite strike off all service I have done,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>In most accepted pain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>AGAMEMNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Let Diomedes bear him,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have</span><br/>
<span id='33'>What he requests of us. Good Diomed,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Furnish you fairly for this interchange:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DIOMEDES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Which I am proud to bear.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS</em></p>
<p><em>Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS, before their tent</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ULYSSES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Please it our general to pass strangely by him,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>As if he were forgot; and, princes all,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>If so, I have derision medicinable,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>To use between your strangeness and his pride,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Which his own will shall have desire to drink:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>It may be good: pride hath no other glass</span><br/>
<span id='49'>To show itself but pride, for supple knees</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>AGAMEMNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>We'll execute your purpose, and put on</span><br/>
<span id='52'>A form of strangeness as we pass along:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>So do each lord, and either greet him not,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ACHILLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>What, comes the general to speak with me?</span><br/>
<span id='57'>You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>AGAMEMNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>What says Achilles? would he aught with us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>NESTOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Would you, my lord, aught with the general?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ACHILLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>No.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>NESTOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Nothing, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>AGAMEMNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>The better.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ACHILLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Good day, good day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MENELAUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>How do you? how do you?</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ACHILLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>What, does the cuckold scorn me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>AJAX</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>How now, Patroclus!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ACHILLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Good morrow, Ajax.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>AJAX</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Ha?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ACHILLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Good morrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>AJAX</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Ay, and good next day too.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ACHILLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PATROCLUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>They pass by strangely: they were used to bend</span><br/>
<span id='73'>To send their smiles before them to Achilles;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>To come as humbly as they used to creep</span><br/>
<span id='75'>To holy altars.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ACHILLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>                  What, am I poor of late?</span><br/>
<span id='77'>'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Must fall out with men too: what the declined is</span><br/>
<span id='79'>He shall as soon read in the eyes of others</span><br/>
<span id='80'>As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And not a man, for being simply man,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Hath any honour, but honour for those honours</span><br/>
<span id='84'>That are without him, as place, riches, favour,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Prizes of accident as oft as merit:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Do one pluck down another and together</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy</span><br/>
<span id='91'>At ample point all that I did possess,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Something not worth in me such rich beholding</span><br/>
<span id='94'>As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>I'll interrupt his reading.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>How now Ulysses!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ULYSSES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>                  Now, great Thetis' son!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ACHILLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>What are you reading?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ULYSSES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>A strange fellow here</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>How much in having, or without or in,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>As when his virtues shining upon others</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Heat them and they retort that heat again</span><br/>
<span id='106'>To the first giver.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>ACHILLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>This is not strange, Ulysses.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>The beauty that is borne here in the face</span><br/>
<span id='109'>The bearer knows not, but commends itself</span><br/>
<span id='110'>To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Salutes each other with each other's form;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>For speculation turns not to itself,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ULYSSES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>I do not strain at the position,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='118'>It is familiar,&mdash;but at the author's drift;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves</span><br/>
<span id='120'>That no man is the lord of any thing,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Though in and of him there be much consisting,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Till he communicate his parts to others:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Nor doth he of himself know them for aught</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Till he behold them form'd in the applause</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Where they're extended; who, like an arch,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>reverberates</span><br/>
<span id='127'>The voice again, or, like a gate of steel</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Fronting the sun, receives and renders back</span><br/>
<span id='129'>His figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this;</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And apprehended here immediately</span><br/>
<span id='131'>The unknown Ajax.</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Most abject in regard and dear in use!</span><br/>
<span id='135'>What things again most dear in the esteem</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='137'>An act that very chance doth throw upon him&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>While some men leave to do!</span><br/>
<span id='140'>How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!</span><br/>
<span id='142'>How one man eats into another's pride,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>While pride is fasting in his wantonness!</span><br/>
<span id='144'>To see these Grecian lords!&mdash;why, even already</span><br/>
<span id='145'>They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast</span><br/>
<span id='147'>And great Troy shrieking.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>ACHILLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>I do believe it; for they pass'd by me</span><br/>
<span id='149'>As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>ULYSSES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd</span><br/>
<span id='155'>As fast as they are made, forgot as soon</span><br/>
<span id='156'>As done: perseverance, dear my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail</span><br/>
<span id='159'>In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>For honour travels in a strait so narrow,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;</span><br/>
<span id='162'>For emulation hath a thousand sons</span><br/>
<span id='163'>That one by one pursue: if you give way,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And leave you hindmost;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;</span><br/>
<span id='171'>For time is like a fashionable host</span><br/>
<span id='172'>That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not</span><br/>
<span id='176'>virtue seek</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Remuneration for the thing it was;</span><br/>
<span id='178'>For beauty, wit,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all</span><br/>
<span id='181'>To envious and calumniating time.</span><br/>
<span id='182'>One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Though they are made and moulded of things past,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>And give to dust that is a little gilt</span><br/>
<span id='186'>More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.</span><br/>
<span id='187'>The present eye praises the present object.</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Since things in motion sooner catch the eye</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>And still it might, and yet it may again,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive</span><br/>
<span id='194'>And case thy reputation in thy tent;</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves</span><br/>
<span id='197'>And drave great Mars to faction.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>ACHILLES</strong></a>

<span id='198'>Of this my privacy</span><br/>
<span id='199'>I have strong reasons.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>ULYSSES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>But 'gainst your privacy</span><br/>
<span id='201'>The reasons are more potent and heroical:</span><br/>
<span id='202'>'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love</span><br/>
<span id='203'>With one of Priam's daughters.</span><br/>

<span id='speech35'><strong>ULYSSES</strong></a>

<span id='205'>Is that a wonder?</span><br/>
<span id='206'>The providence that's in a watchful state</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.</span><br/>
<span id='211'>There is a mystery&mdash;with whom relation</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Durst never meddle&mdash;in the soul of state;</span><br/>
<span id='213'>Which hath an operation more divine</span><br/>
<span id='214'>Than breath or pen can give expressure to:</span><br/>
<span id='215'>All the commerce that you have had with Troy</span><br/>
<span id='216'>As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;</span><br/>
<span id='217'>And better would it fit Achilles much</span><br/>
<span id='218'>To throw down Hector than Polyxena:</span><br/>
<span id='219'>But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,</span><br/>
<span id='220'>When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,</span><br/>
<span id='221'>And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,</span><br/>
<span id='222'>'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,</span><br/>
<span id='223'>But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'</span><br/>

<span id='229'>In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;</span><br/>

<span id='233'>Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,</span><br/>

<span id='speech48'><strong>THERSITES</strong></a>

<span id='263'>Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,&mdash;a stride</span><br/>
<span id='264'>and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no</span><br/>
<span id='265'>arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:</span><br/>
<span id='266'>bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should</span><br/>
<span id='267'>say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'</span><br/>
<span id='268'>and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire</span><br/>
<span id='269'>in a flint, which will not show without knocking.</span><br/>
<span id='270'>The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his</span><br/>
<span id='271'>neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in</span><br/>
<span id='272'>vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,</span><br/>
<span id='273'>Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think</span><br/>
<span id='274'>you of this man that takes me for the general? He's</span><br/>
<span id='275'>grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.</span><br/>

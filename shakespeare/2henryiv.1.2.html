<span id='1'>Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Page</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy</span><br/>
<span id='3'>water; but, for the party that owed it, he might</span><br/>
<span id='4'>have more diseases than he knew for.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the</span><br/>
<span id='6'>brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not</span><br/>
<span id='7'>able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more</span><br/>
<span id='8'>than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only</span><br/>
<span id='9'>witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other</span><br/>
<span id='10'>men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that</span><br/>
<span id='11'>hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the</span><br/>
<span id='12'>prince put thee into my service for any other reason</span><br/>
<span id='13'>than to set me off, why then I have no judgment.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn</span><br/>
<span id='15'>in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never</span><br/>
<span id='16'>manned with an agate till now: but I will inset you</span><br/>
<span id='17'>neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and</span><br/>
<span id='18'>send you back again to your master, for a jewel,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is</span><br/>
<span id='20'>not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in</span><br/>
<span id='21'>the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his</span><br/>
<span id='22'>cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is</span><br/>
<span id='23'>a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tis</span><br/>
<span id='24'>not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a</span><br/>
<span id='25'>face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence</span><br/>
<span id='26'>out of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had</span><br/>
<span id='27'>writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He</span><br/>
<span id='28'>may keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about</span><br/>
<span id='30'>the satin for my short cloak and my slops?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Page</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>He said, sir, you should procure him better</span><br/>
<span id='32'>assurance than Bardolph: he would not take his</span><br/>
<span id='33'>band and yours; he liked not the security.</span><br/>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Let him be damned, like the glutton! pray God his</span><br/>
<span id='35'>tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascally</span><br/>
<span id='36'>yea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>and then stand upon security! The whoreson</span><br/>
<span id='38'>smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and</span><br/>
<span id='39'>bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is</span><br/>
<span id='40'>through with them in honest taking up, then they</span><br/>
<span id='41'>must stand upon security. I had as lief they would</span><br/>
<span id='42'>put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with</span><br/>
<span id='43'>security. I looked a' should have sent me two and</span><br/>
<span id='44'>twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he</span><br/>
<span id='45'>sends me security. Well, he may sleep in security;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness</span><br/>
<span id='47'>of his wife shines through it: and yet cannot he</span><br/>
<span id='48'>see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Where's Bardolph?</span><br/>

<span id='51'>I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Smithfield: an I could get me but a wife in the</span><br/>
<span id='53'>stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.</span><br/>

<span id='speech20'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>

<span id='70'>What! a young knave, and begging! Is there not</span><br/>
<span id='71'>wars? is there not employment? doth not the king</span><br/>
<span id='72'>lack subjects? do not the rebels need soldiers?</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it</span><br/>
<span id='74'>is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell</span><br/>
<span id='76'>how to make it.</span><br/>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Servant</strong></a>

<span id='77'>You mistake me, sir.</span><br/>

<span id='speech22'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>

<span id='78'>Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? setting</span><br/>
<span id='79'>my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied</span><br/>
<span id='80'>in my throat, if I had said so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Servant</strong></a>

<span id='speech24'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>

<span id='85'>I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside that</span><br/>

<span id='88'>hanged. You hunt counter: hence! avaunt!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Servant</strong></a>

<span id='89'>Sir, my lord would speak with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>My good lord! God give your lordship good time of</span><br/>
<span id='92'>day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard</span><br/>
<span id='93'>say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship</span><br/>
<span id='94'>goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not</span><br/>
<span id='95'>clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in</span><br/>
<span id='96'>you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must</span><br/>
<span id='97'>humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care</span><br/>
<span id='98'>of your health.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Shrewsbury.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is</span><br/>
<span id='102'>returned with some discomfort from Wales.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when</span><br/>
<span id='104'>I sent for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into</span><br/>
<span id='106'>this same whoreson apoplexy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with</span><br/>
<span id='108'>you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>an't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the</span><br/>
<span id='111'>blood, a whoreson tingling.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>What tell you me of it? be it as it is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>It hath its original from much grief, from study and</span><br/>
<span id='114'>perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of</span><br/>
<span id='115'>his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I think you are fallen into the disease; for you</span><br/>
<span id='117'>hear not what I say to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an't please</span><br/>
<span id='119'>you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady</span><br/>
<span id='120'>of not marking, that I am troubled withal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>To punish you by the heels would amend the</span><br/>
<span id='122'>attention of your ears; and I care not if I do</span><br/>
<span id='123'>become your physician.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>your lordship may minister the potion of</span><br/>
<span id='126'>imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how</span><br/>
<span id='127'>should I be your patient to follow your</span><br/>
<span id='128'>prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a</span><br/>
<span id='129'>scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>I sent for you, when there were matters against you</span><br/>
<span id='131'>for your life, to come speak with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the</span><br/>
<span id='133'>laws of this land-service, I did not come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>I would it were otherwise; I would my means were</span><br/>
<span id='138'>greater, and my waist slenderer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>You have misled the youthful prince.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow</span><br/>
<span id='141'>with the great belly, and he my dog.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your</span><br/>
<span id='143'>day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded</span><br/>
<span id='144'>over your night's exploit on Gad's-hill: you may</span><br/>
<span id='145'>thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting</span><br/>
<span id='146'>that action.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>My lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a</span><br/>
<span id='149'>sleeping wolf.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt</span><br/>
<span id='152'>out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say</span><br/>
<span id='154'>of wax, my growth would approve the truth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>There is not a white hair on your face but should</span><br/>
<span id='156'>have his effect of gravity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>You follow the young prince up and down, like his</span><br/>
<span id='159'>ill angel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope</span><br/>
<span id='161'>he that looks upon me will take me without weighing:</span><br/>
<span id='162'>and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I</span><br/>
<span id='163'>cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these</span><br/>
<span id='164'>costermonger times that true valour is turned</span><br/>
<span id='165'>bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath</span><br/>
<span id='166'>his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the</span><br/>
<span id='167'>other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of</span><br/>
<span id='168'>this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.</span><br/>
<span id='169'>You that are old consider not the capacities of us</span><br/>
<span id='170'>that are young; you do measure the heat of our</span><br/>
<span id='171'>livers with the bitterness of your galls: and we</span><br/>
<span id='172'>that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>are wags too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>that are written down old with all the characters of</span><br/>
<span id='176'>age? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a</span><br/>
<span id='177'>yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an</span><br/>
<span id='178'>increasing belly? is not your voice broken? your</span><br/>
<span id='179'>wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and</span><br/>
<span id='180'>every part about you blasted with antiquity? and</span><br/>
<span id='181'>will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the</span><br/>
<span id='183'>afternoon, with a white head and something a round</span><br/>
<span id='184'>belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing</span><br/>
<span id='185'>and singing of anthems. To approve my youth</span><br/>
<span id='186'>further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in</span><br/>
<span id='187'>judgment and understanding; and he that will caper</span><br/>
<span id='188'>with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the</span><br/>
<span id='189'>money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that</span><br/>
<span id='190'>the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>and you took it like a sensible lord. I have</span><br/>
<span id='192'>chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;</span><br/>
<span id='193'>marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk</span><br/>
<span id='194'>and old sack.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>Well, God send the prince a better companion!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>God send the companion a better prince! I cannot</span><br/>
<span id='197'>rid my hands of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>Lord Chief-Justice</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry: I</span><br/>
<span id='199'>hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster</span><br/>
<span id='200'>against the Archbishop and the Earl of</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Northumberland.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look</span><br/>
<span id='203'>you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean</span><br/>
<span id='206'>not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I</span><br/>
<span id='208'>might never spit white again. There is not a</span><br/>
<span id='209'>dangerous action can peep out his head but I am</span><br/>
<span id='210'>thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it</span><br/>
<span id='211'>was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if</span><br/>
<span id='212'>they have a good thing, to make it too common. If</span><br/>
<span id='213'>ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give</span><br/>
<span id='214'>me rest. I would to God my name were not so</span><br/>
<span id='215'>terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be</span><br/>

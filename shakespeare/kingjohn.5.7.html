<h1>King John</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene VII</H3>
<h4>The orchard in Swinstead Abbey.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter PRINCE HENRY, SALISBURY, and BIGOT</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>It is too late: the life of all his blood</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Doth by the idle comments that it makes</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Foretell the ending of mortality.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PEMBROKE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PEMBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief</span><br/>
<span id='7'>That, being brought into the open air,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>It would allay the burning quality</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Of that fell poison which assaileth him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Let him be brought into the orchard here.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Doth he still rage?</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit BIGOT</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PEMBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>He is more patient</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Than when you left him; even now he sung.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes</span><br/>
<span id='15'>In their continuance will not feel themselves.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds</span><br/>
<span id='19'>With many legions of strange fantasies,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Whi ch, in their throng and press to that last hold,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death</span><br/>
<span id='22'>should sing.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings</span><br/>
<span id='26'>His soul and body to their lasting rest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born</span><br/>
<span id='28'>To set a form upon that indigest</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Attendants, and BIGOT, carrying KING JOHN in a chair</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>It would not out at windows nor at doors.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>There is so hot a summer in my bosom,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>That all my bowels crumble up to dust:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Upon a parchment, and against this fire</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Do I shrink up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>                  How fares your majesty?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Poison'd,&mdash;ill fare&mdash;dead, forsook, cast off:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And none of you will bid the winter come</span><br/>
<span id='40'>To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north</span><br/>
<span id='43'>To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And so ingrateful, you deny me that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>O that there were some virtue in my tears,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>That might relieve you!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>The salt in them is hot.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Within me is a hell; and there the poison</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize</span><br/>
<span id='52'>On unreprievable condemned blood.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the BASTARD</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>O, I am scalded with my violent motion,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And spleen of speed to see your majesty!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Are turned to one thread, one little hair:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Which holds but till thy news be uttered;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And then all this thou seest is but a clod</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And module of confounded royalty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>For in a night the best part of my power,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>As I upon advantage did remove,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Were in the Washes all unwarily</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Devoured by the unexpected flood.</span><br/>
<p><em>KING JOHN dies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Even so must I run on, and even so stop.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>When this was now a king, and now is clay?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind</span><br/>
<span id='75'>To do the office for thee of revenge,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>As it on earth hath been thy servant still.</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And instantly return with me again,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>To push destruction and perpetual shame</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Out of the weak door of our fainting land.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>The Dauphin rages at our very heels.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>It seems you know not, then, so much as we:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And brings from him such offers of our peace</span><br/>
<span id='89'>As we with honour and respect may take,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>With purpose presently to leave this war.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>He will the rather do it when he sees</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Nay, it is in a manner done already;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>For many carriages he hath dispatch'd</span><br/>
<span id='95'>To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel</span><br/>
<span id='96'>To the disposing of the cardinal:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>With whom yourself, myself and other lords,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>If you think meet, this afternoon will post</span><br/>
<span id='99'>To consummate this business happily.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>With other princes that may best be spared,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Shall wait upon your father's funeral.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>At Worcester must his body be interr'd;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>For so he will'd it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Thither shall it then:</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And happily may your sweet self put on</span><br/>
<span id='107'>The lineal state and glory of the land!</span><br/>
<span id='108'>To whom with all submission, on my knee</span><br/>
<span id='109'>I do bequeath my faithful services</span><br/>
<span id='110'>And true subjection everlastingly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>And the like tender of our love we make,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>To rest without a spot for evermore.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>I have a kind soul that would give you thanks</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And knows not how to do it but with tears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>O, let us pay the time but needful woe,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.</span><br/>
<span id='117'>This England never did, nor never shall,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>But when it first did help to wound itself.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Now these her princes are come home again,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Come the three corners of the world in arms,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>If England to itself do rest but true.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

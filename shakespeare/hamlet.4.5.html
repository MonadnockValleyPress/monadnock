<blockquote>
<em>Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE, HORATIO, and a Gentleman</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I will not speak with her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>She is importunate, indeed distract:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Her mood will needs be pitied.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>What would she have?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>She speaks much of her father; says she hears</span><br/>
<span id='6'>There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Yet the unshaped use of it doth move</span><br/>
<span id='10'>The hearers to collection; they aim at it,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures</span><br/>
<span id='13'>yield them,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Indeed would make one think there might be thought,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Let her come in.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit HORATIO</em></p>
<span id='19'>To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>So full of artless jealousy is guilt,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter HORATIO, with OPHELIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>How now, Ophelia!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>[Sings]</span><br/>
<span id='26'>How should I your true love know</span><br/>
<span id='27'>From another one?</span><br/>
<span id='28'>By his cockle hat and staff,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And his sandal shoon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Say you? nay, pray you, mark.</span><br/>
<p><em>Sings</em></p>
<span id='32'>He is dead and gone, lady,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>He is dead and gone;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>At his head a grass-green turf,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>At his heels a stone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Nay, but, Ophelia,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Pray you, mark.</span><br/>
<p><em>Sings</em></p>
<span id='38'>White his shroud as the mountain snow,&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter KING CLAUDIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Alas, look here, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>[Sings]</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Larded with sweet flowers</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Which bewept to the grave did go</span><br/>
<span id='43'>With true-love showers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>How do you, pretty lady?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's</span><br/>
<span id='46'>daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not</span><br/>
<span id='47'>what we may be. God be at your table!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Conceit upon her father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they</span><br/>
<span id='50'>ask you what it means, say you this:</span><br/>
<p><em>Sings</em></p>
<span id='51'>To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>All in the morning betime,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And I a maid at your window,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>To be your Valentine.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And dupp'd the chamber-door;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Let in the maid, that out a maid</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Never departed more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Pretty Ophelia!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:</span><br/>
<p><em>Sings</em></p>
<span id='61'>By Gis and by Saint Charity,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Alack, and fie for shame!</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Young men will do't, if they come to't;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>By cock, they are to blame.</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Quoth she, before you tumbled me,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>You promised me to wed.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>An thou hadst not come to my bed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>How long hath she been thus?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I</span><br/>
<span id='71'>cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him</span><br/>
<span id='72'>i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my</span><br/>
<span id='74'>coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>good night, good night.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Follow her close; give her good watch,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>I pray you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit HORATIO</em></p>
<span id='78'>O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs</span><br/>
<span id='79'>All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>When sorrows come, they come not single spies</span><br/>
<span id='81'>But in battalions. First, her father slain:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Next, your son gone; and he most violent author</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Of his own just remove: the people muddied,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Divided from herself and her fair judgment,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Last, and as much containing as all these,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Her brother is in secret come from France;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And wants not buzzers to infect his ear</span><br/>
<span id='93'>With pestilent speeches of his father's death;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Will nothing stick our person to arraign</span><br/>
<span id='96'>In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Like to a murdering-piece, in many places</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Gives me superfluous death.</span><br/>
<p><em>A noise within</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Alack, what noise is this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter another Gentleman</em></p>
<span id='101'>What is the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Save yourself, my lord:</span><br/>
<span id='103'>The ocean, overpeering of his list,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And, as the world were now but to begin,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Antiquity forgot, custom not known,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>The ratifiers and props of every word,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!</span><br/>
<span id='114'>O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>The doors are broke.</span><br/>
<p><em>Noise within</em></p>
<p><em>Enter LAERTES, armed; Danes following</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Danes</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>No, let's come in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>                  I pray you, give me leave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Danes</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>We will, we will.</span><br/>
<p><em>They retire without the door</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Give me my father!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>                  Calmly, good Laertes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Of my true mother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>                  What is the cause, Laertes,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>There's such divinity doth hedge a king,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>That treason can but peep to what it would,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Speak, man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Where is my father?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>But not by him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Let him demand his fill.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:</span><br/>
<span id='140'>To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!</span><br/>
<span id='142'>I dare damnation. To this point I stand,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>That both the worlds I give to negligence,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Most thoroughly for my father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Who shall stay you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>My will, not all the world:</span><br/>
<span id='148'>And for my means, I'll husband them so well,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>They shall go far with little.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Good Laertes,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>If you desire to know the certainty</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Winner and loser?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>None but his enemies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Will you know them then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>And like the kind life-rendering pelican,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Repast them with my blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Why, now you speak</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Like a good child and a true gentleman.</span><br/>
<span id='162'>That I am guiltless of your father's death,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>And am most sensible in grief for it,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>It shall as level to your judgment pierce</span><br/>
<span id='165'>As day does to your eye.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>Danes</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>[Within]                Let her come in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>How now! what noise is that?</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter OPHELIA</em></p>
<span id='168'>O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!</span><br/>
<span id='170'>By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!</span><br/>
<span id='173'>O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Should be as moral as an old man's life?</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>It sends some precious instance of itself</span><br/>
<span id='177'>After the thing it loves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>[Sings]</span><br/>
<span id='179'>They bore him barefaced on the bier;</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;</span><br/>
<span id='181'>And in his grave rain'd many a tear:&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Fare you well, my dove!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>It could not move thus.</span><br/>

<span id='188'>O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false</span><br/>
<span id='189'>steward, that stole his master's daughter.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='190'>This nothing's more than matter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,</span><br/>

<span id='speech57'><strong>LAERTES</strong></span>

<span id='193'>A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='194'>There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue</span><br/>

<span id='196'>herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with</span><br/>
<span id='197'>a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you</span><br/>
<span id='198'>some violets, but they withered all when my father</span><br/>
<span id='199'>died: they say he made a good end,&mdash;</span><br/>

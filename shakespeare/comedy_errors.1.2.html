<h4>The Mart.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse, and First Merchant</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Merchant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>This very day a Syracusian merchant</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Is apprehended for arrival here;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And not being able to buy out his life</span><br/>
<span id='6'>According to the statute of the town,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>There is your money that I had to keep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Within this hour it will be dinner-time:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And then return and sleep within mine inn,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>For with long travel I am stiff and weary.</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Get thee away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Many a man would take you at your word,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And go indeed, having so good a mean.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>When I am dull with care and melancholy,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Lightens my humour with his merry jests.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>What, will you walk with me about the town,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And then go to my inn and dine with me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Merchant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Of whom I hope to make much benefit;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And afterward consort you till bed-time:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>My present business calls me from you now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Farewell till then: I will go lose myself</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And wander up and down to view the city.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>First Merchant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Sir, I commend you to your own content.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>He that commends me to mine own content</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Commends me to the thing I cannot get.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>I to the world am like a drop of water</span><br/>
<span id='36'>That in the ocean seeks another drop,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>So I, to find a mother and a brother,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DROMIO of Ephesus</em></p>
<span id='41'>Here comes the almanac of my true date.</span><br/>
<span id='42'>What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>My mistress made it one upon my cheek:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>She is so hot because the meat is cold;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The meat is cold because you come not home;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>You come not home because you have no stomach;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>You have no stomach having broke your fast;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Are penitent for your default to-day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Where have you left the money that I gave you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>O,&mdash;sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last</span><br/>
<span id='56'>To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?</span><br/>
<span id='57'>The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>I am not in a sportive humour now:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?</span><br/>
<span id='60'>We being strangers here, how darest thou trust</span><br/>
<span id='61'>So great a charge from thine own custody?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>I from my mistress come to you in post;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>If I return, I shall be post indeed,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>For she will score your fault upon my pate.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And strike you home without a messenger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>My charge was but to fetch you from the mart</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>My mistress and her sister stays for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours</span><br/>
<span id='79'>That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>I have some marks of yours upon my pate,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>But not a thousand marks between you both.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>If I should pay your worship those again,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Perchance you will not bear them patiently.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Upon my life, by some device or other</span><br/>
<span id='95'>The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>They say this town is full of cozenage,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Soul-killing witches that deform the body,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And many such-like liberties of sin:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.</span><br/>
<span id='103'>I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>I greatly fear my money is not safe.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

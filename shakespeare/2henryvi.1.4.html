<h1>Henry VI, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Gloucester's garden.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter MARGARET JOURDAIN, HUME, SOUTHWELL, and BOLINGBROKE</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HUME</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Come, my masters; the duchess, I tell you, expects</span><br/>
<span id='2'>performance of your promises.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Master Hume, we are therefore provided: will her</span><br/>
<span id='4'>ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>HUME</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Ay, what else? fear you not her courage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>I have heard her reported to be a woman of an</span><br/>
<span id='7'>invincible spirit: but it shall be convenient,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Master Hume, that you be by her aloft, while we be</span><br/>
<span id='9'>busy below; and so, I pray you, go, in God's name,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>and leave us.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit HUME</em></p>
<span id='11'>Mother Jourdain, be you</span><br/>
<span id='12'>prostrate and grovel on the earth; John Southwell,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>read you; and let us to our work.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the DUCHESS aloft, HUME following</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Well said, my masters; and welcome all. To this</span><br/>
<span id='15'>gear the sooner the better.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Patience, good lady; wizards know their times:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>The time of night when Troy was set on fire;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>That time best fits the work we have in hand.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Madam, sit you and fear not: whom we raise,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.</span><br/>
<p><em>Here they do the ceremonies belonging, and make the  circle; BOLINGBROKE or SOUTHWELL reads, Conjuro te, & c. It thunders and lightens terribly; then the Spirit riseth</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Spirit</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Adsum.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MARGARET JOURDAIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Asmath,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>By the eternal God, whose name and power</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Thou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>For, till thou speak, thou shalt not pass from hence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Spirit</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Ask what thou wilt. That I had said and done!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>'First of the king: what shall of him become?'</span><br/>
<p><em>Reading out of a paper</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Spirit</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>But him outlive, and die a violent death.</span><br/>
<p><em>As the Spirit speaks, SOUTHWELL writes the answer</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>'What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Spirit</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>By water shall he die, and take his end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>'What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Spirit</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Let him shun castles;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Than where castles mounted stand.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Have done, for more I hardly can endure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Descend to darkness and the burning lake!</span><br/>
<span id='41'>False fiend, avoid!</span><br/>
<p><em>Thunder and lightning. Exit Spirit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter YORK and BUCKINGHAM with their Guard and break in</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Beldam, I think we watch'd you at an inch.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>What, madam, are you there? the king and commonweal</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Are deeply indebted for this piece of pains:</span><br/>
<span id='46'>My lord protector will, I doubt it not,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DUCHESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Not half so bad as thine to England's king,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Injurious duke, that threatest where's no cause.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>True, madam, none at all: what call you this?</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Away with them! let them be clapp'd up close.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And kept asunder. You, madam, shall with us.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Stafford, take her to thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt above DUCHESS and HUME, guarded</em></p>
<span id='54'>We'll see your trinkets here all forthcoming.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>All, away!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt guard with MARGARET JOURDAIN, SOUTHWELL,  & c</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Lord Buckingham, methinks, you watch'd her well:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>What have we here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='60'>'The duke yet lives, that Henry shall depose;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>But him outlive, and die a violent death.'</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Why, this is just</span><br/>
<span id='63'>'Aio te, AEacida, Romanos vincere posse.'</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Well, to the rest:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?</span><br/>
<span id='66'>By water shall he die, and take his end.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Let him shun castles;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Than where castles mounted stand.'</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Come, come, my lords;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>These oracles are hardly attain'd,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And hardly understood.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>The king is now in progress towards Saint Alban's,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>With him the husband of this lovely lady:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Thither go these news, as fast as horse can</span><br/>
<span id='77'>carry them:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>A sorry breakfast for my lord protector.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Your grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>To be the post, in hope of his reward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>At your pleasure, my good lord. Who's within</span><br/>
<span id='82'>there, ho!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Servingman</em></p>
<span id='83'>Invite my Lords of Salisbury and Warwick</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To sup with me to-morrow night. Away!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

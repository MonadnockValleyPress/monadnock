<h1>Troilus and Cressida</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The Same. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Who were those went by?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ALEXANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Queen Hecuba and Helen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>And whither go they?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ALEXANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Up to the eastern tower,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Whose height commands as subject all the vale,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>To see the battle. Hector, whose patience</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And, like as there were husbandry in war,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And to the field goes he; where every flower</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw</span><br/>
<span id='13'>In Hector's wrath.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>                  What was his cause of anger?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ALEXANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks</span><br/>
<span id='16'>A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>They call him Ajax.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Good; and what of him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ALEXANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>They say he is a very man per se,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And stands alone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ALEXANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their</span><br/>
<span id='23'>particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man</span><br/>
<span id='25'>into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his</span><br/>
<span id='26'>valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with</span><br/>
<span id='27'>discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he</span><br/>
<span id='28'>hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he</span><br/>
<span id='29'>carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without</span><br/>
<span id='30'>cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the</span><br/>
<span id='31'>joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint</span><br/>
<span id='32'>that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>But how should this man, that makes</span><br/>
<span id='35'>me smile, make Hector angry?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ALEXANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and</span><br/>
<span id='37'>struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath</span><br/>
<span id='38'>ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Who comes here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ALEXANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Madam, your uncle Pandarus.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PANDARUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Hector's a gallant man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ALEXANDER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>As may be in the world, lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>What's that? what's that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When</span><br/>
<span id='47'>were you at Ilium?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>This morning, uncle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector</span><br/>
<span id='50'>armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not</span><br/>
<span id='51'>up, was she?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Even so: Hector was stirring early.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>That were we talking of, and of his anger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Was he angry?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>So he says here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay</span><br/>
<span id='58'>about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take</span><br/>
<span id='60'>heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>What, is he angry too?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>O Jupiter! there's no comparison.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a</span><br/>
<span id='65'>man if you see him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>So he is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>He is not Hector.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were</span><br/>
<span id='76'>himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend</span><br/>
<span id='77'>or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were</span><br/>
<span id='78'>in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Excuse me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>He is elder.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Pardon me, pardon me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another</span><br/>
<span id='83'>tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not</span><br/>
<span id='84'>have his wit this year.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>He shall not need it, if he have his own.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Nor his qualities.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>No matter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Nor his beauty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>'Twould not become him; his own's better.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>You have no judgment, niece: Helen</span><br/>
<span id='91'>herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for</span><br/>
<span id='92'>a brown favour&mdash;for so 'tis, I must confess,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>not brown neither,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>No, but brown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>To say the truth, true and not true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>She praised his complexion above Paris.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Why, Paris hath colour enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>So he has.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised</span><br/>
<span id='101'>him above, his complexion is higher than his; he</span><br/>
<span id='102'>having colour enough, and the other higher, is too</span><br/>
<span id='103'>flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as</span><br/>
<span id='104'>lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for</span><br/>
<span id='105'>a copper nose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Then she's a merry Greek indeed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other</span><br/>
<span id='109'>day into the compassed window,&mdash;and, you know, he</span><br/>
<span id='110'>has not past three or four hairs on his chin,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his</span><br/>
<span id='112'>particulars therein to a total.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within</span><br/>
<span id='114'>three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came</span><br/>
<span id='117'>and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling</span><br/>
<span id='120'>becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>O, he smiles valiantly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Does he not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen</span><br/>
<span id='125'>loves Troilus,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll</span><br/>
<span id='127'>prove it so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem</span><br/>
<span id='129'>an addle egg.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle</span><br/>
<span id='131'>head, you would eat chickens i' the shell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled</span><br/>
<span id='133'>his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I</span><br/>
<span id='134'>must needs confess,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Without the rack.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed</span><br/>
<span id='139'>that her eyes ran o'er.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>With mill-stones.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>And Cassandra laughed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>But there was more temperate fire under the pot of</span><br/>
<span id='143'>her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>And Hector laughed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>At what was all this laughing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed</span><br/>
<span id='148'>too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>What was his answer?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech89'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your</span><br/>
<span id='152'>chin, and one of them is white.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech90'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>This is her question.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech91'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and</span><br/>
<span id='155'>fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white</span><br/>
<span id='156'>hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.'</span><br/>
<span id='157'>'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't</span><br/>
<span id='159'>out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!</span><br/>
<span id='160'>and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the</span><br/>
<span id='161'>rest so laughed, that it passed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech92'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>So let it now; for it has been while going by.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech93'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech94'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>So I do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech95'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twere</span><br/>
<span id='166'>a man born in April.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech96'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle</span><br/>
<span id='168'>against May.</span><br/>
<p><em>A retreat sounded</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech97'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we</span><br/>
<span id='170'>stand up here, and see them as they pass toward</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Ilium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech98'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>At your pleasure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech99'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may</span><br/>
<span id='174'>see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their</span><br/>
<span id='175'>names as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech100'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>Speak not so loud.</span><br/>
<p><em>AENEAS passes</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech101'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one of</span><br/>
<span id='178'>the flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but mark</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Troilus; you shall see anon.</span><br/>
<p><em>ANTENOR passes</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech102'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Who's that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech103'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you;</span><br/>
<span id='182'>and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundest</span><br/>
<span id='183'>judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.</span><br/>
<span id='184'>When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if</span><br/>
<span id='185'>he see me, you shall see him nod at me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech104'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>Will he give you the nod?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech105'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>You shall see.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech106'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>If he do, the rich shall have more.</span><br/>
<p><em>HECTOR passes</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech107'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a</span><br/>
<span id='190'>fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's</span><br/>
<span id='192'>a countenance! is't not a brave man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech108'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>O, a brave man!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech109'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you</span><br/>
<span id='195'>what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do</span><br/>
<span id='196'>you see? look you there: there's no jesting;</span><br/>
<span id='197'>there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say:</span><br/>
<span id='198'>there be hacks!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech110'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>Be those with swords?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech111'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>Swords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil come</span><br/>
<span id='201'>to him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one's</span><br/>
<span id='202'>heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.</span><br/>
<p><em>PARIS passes</em></p>
<span id='203'>Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came</span><br/>
<span id='205'>hurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will do</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could see</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.</span><br/>
<p><em>HELENUS passes</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech112'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>Who's that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech113'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='209'>That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's</span><br/>

<span id='speech115'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>

<span id='212'>Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I</span><br/>
<span id='213'>marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the</span><br/>
<span id='214'>people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech116'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='215'>What sneaking fellow comes yonder?</span><br/>
<p><em>TROILUS passes</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech117'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!</span><br/>
<span id='217'>there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the</span><br/>
<span id='218'>prince of chivalry!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech118'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='219'>Peace, for shame, peace!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech119'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='220'>Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon</span><br/>
<span id='221'>him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and</span><br/>
<span id='222'>his helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,</span><br/>
<span id='223'>and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw</span><br/>
<span id='224'>three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,</span><br/>
<span id='226'>he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?</span><br/>
<span id='227'>Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to</span><br/>
<span id='228'>change, would give an eye to boot.</span><br/>

<span id='230'>Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!</span><br/>
<span id='231'>porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the</span><br/>
<span id='232'>eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles</span><br/>
<span id='233'>are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had</span><br/>
<span id='234'>rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and</span><br/>
<span id='235'>all Greece.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech122'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='236'>There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech123'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>

<span id='237'>Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.</span><br/>

<span id='238'>Well, well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech125'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='239'>'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? have</span><br/>
<span id='240'>you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not</span><br/>
<span id='241'>birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,</span><br/>
<span id='242'>learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,</span><br/>
<span id='243'>and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech126'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='244'>Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no date</span><br/>
<span id='245'>in the pie, for then the man's date's out.</span><br/>

<span id='248'>Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to</span><br/>

<span id='251'>defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a</span><br/>
<span id='252'>thousand watches.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech129'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></a>

<span id='253'>Say one of your watches.</span><br/>

<span id='speech130'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='254'>Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the</span><br/>
<span id='255'>chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would</span><br/>
<span id='256'>not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took</span><br/>
<span id='257'>the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it's</span><br/>

<span id='269'>By the same token, you are a bawd.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit PANDARUS</em></p>
<span id='270'>Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,</span><br/>
<span id='271'>He offers in another's enterprise;</span><br/>
<span id='272'>But more in Troilus thousand fold I see</span><br/>
<span id='273'>Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;</span><br/>
<span id='274'>Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:</span><br/>
<span id='275'>Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.</span><br/>
<span id='276'>That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:</span><br/>
<span id='277'>Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:</span><br/>
<span id='278'>That she was never yet that ever knew</span><br/>
<span id='279'>Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.</span><br/>
<span id='280'>Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:</span><br/>
<span id='281'>Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:</span><br/>
<span id='282'>Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,</span><br/>
<span id='283'>Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.</span><br/>

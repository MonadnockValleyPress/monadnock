<h1>Henry VI, Part 3</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene VII</h3>
<h4>Before York.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and Soldiers</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And says that once more I shall interchange</span><br/>
<span id='4'>My waned state for Henry's regal crown.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And brought desired help from Burgundy:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>What then remains, we being thus arrived</span><br/>
<span id='8'>From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>But that we enter, as into our dukedom?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>For many men that stumble at the threshold</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Are well foretold that danger lurks within.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>By fair or foul means we must enter in,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>For hither will our friends repair to us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter, on the walls, the Mayor of York, and his Brethren</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Mayor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And shut the gates for safety of ourselves;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Mayor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>True, my good lord; I know you for no less.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>As being well content with that alone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>[Aside]  But when the fox hath once got in his nose,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>He'll soon find means to make the body follow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Mayor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.</span><br/>
<p><em>They descend</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>The good old man would fain that all were well,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Both him and all his brothers unto reason.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the Mayor and two Aldermen, below</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut</span><br/>
<span id='36'>But in the night or in the time of war.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;</span><br/>
<p><em>Takes his keys</em></p>
<span id='38'>For Edward will defend the town and thee,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And all those friends that deign to follow me.</span><br/>
<p><em>March. Enter MONTGOMERY, with drum and soldiers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>To help King Edward in his time of storm,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>As every loyal subject ought to do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Our title to the crown and only claim</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Then fare you well, for I will hence again:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>I came to serve a king and not a duke.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.</span><br/>
<p><em>The drum begins to march</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Nay, stay, Sir John, awhi le, and we'll debate</span><br/>
<span id='52'>By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>What talk you of debating? in few words,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone</span><br/>
<span id='56'>To keep them back that come to succor you:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And Henry but usurps the diadem.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And now will I be Edward's champion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>HASTINGS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Soldier</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of</span><br/>
<span id='72'>England and France, and lord of Ireland,  &amp;c.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>By this I challenge him to single fight.</span><br/>
<p><em>Throws down his gauntlet</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Long live Edward the Fourth!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>And when the morning sun shall raise his car</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Above the border of this horizon,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

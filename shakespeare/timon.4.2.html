<h1>Timon of Athens</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Athens. A room in Timon's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter FLAVIUS, with two or three Servants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Hear you, master steward, where's our master?</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Are we undone? cast off? nothing remaining?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>FLAVIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I am as poor as you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>First Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Such a house broke!</span><br/>
<span id='7'>So noble a master fall'n! All gone! and not</span><br/>
<span id='8'>One friend to take his fortune by the arm,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And go along with him!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>As we do turn our backs</span><br/>
<span id='11'>From our companion thrown into his grave,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>So his familiars to his buried fortunes</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Slink all away, leave their false vows with him,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>A dedicated beggar to the air,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter other Servants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FLAVIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>All broken implements of a ruin'd house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Third Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>That see I by our faces; we are fellows still,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Serving alike in sorrow: leak'd is our bark,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Hearing the surges threat: we must all part</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Into this sea of air.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>FLAVIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Good fellows all,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads, and say,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>'We have seen better days.' Let each take some;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.</span><br/>
<p><em>Servants embrace, and part several ways</em></p>
<span id='33'>O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Since riches point to misery and contempt?</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live</span><br/>
<span id='37'>But in a dream of friendship?</span><br/>
<span id='38'>To have his pomp and all what state compounds</span><br/>
<span id='39'>But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>When man's worst sin is, he does too much good!</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?</span><br/>
<span id='44'>For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!</span><br/>
<span id='48'>He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Supply his life, or that which can command it.</span><br/>
<span id='51'>I'll follow and inquire him out:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

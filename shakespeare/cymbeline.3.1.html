<h1>Cymbeline</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Britain. A hall in Cymbeline's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter in state, CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN,  and Lords at one door, and at another, CAIUS LUCIUS and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CAIUS LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Than in his feats deserving it&mdash;for him</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And his succession granted Rome a tribute,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Is left untender'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>And, to kill the marvel,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Shall be so ever.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>There be many Caesars,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Ere such another Julius. Britain is</span><br/>
<span id='15'>A world by itself; and we will nothing pay</span><br/>
<span id='16'>For wearing our own noses.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>That opportunity</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Which then they had to take from 's, to resume</span><br/>
<span id='19'>We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>The kings your ancestors, together with</span><br/>
<span id='21'>The natural bravery of your isle, which stands</span><br/>
<span id='22'>As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in</span><br/>
<span id='23'>With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Caesar made here; but made not here his brag</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame': with shame&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>That first that ever touch'd him&mdash;he was carried</span><br/>
<span id='29'>From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Poor ignorant baubles!&mdash; upon our terrible seas,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd</span><br/>
<span id='32'>As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof</span><br/>
<span id='33'>The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>O giglot fortune!&mdash;to master Caesar's sword,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And Britons strut with courage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Come, there's no more tribute to be paid: our</span><br/>
<span id='38'>kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>as I said, there is no more such Caesars: other of</span><br/>
<span id='40'>them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such</span><br/>
<span id='41'>straight arms, none.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Son, let your mother end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a</span><br/>
<span id='45'>hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or</span><br/>
<span id='47'>put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute</span><br/>
<span id='48'>for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>You must know,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Till the injurious Romans did extort</span><br/>
<span id='51'>This tribute from us, we were free:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Caesar's ambition,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch</span><br/>
<span id='54'>The sides o' the world, against all colour here</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Ourselves to be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>We do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Say, then, to Caesar,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Who was the first of Britain which did put</span><br/>
<span id='66'>His brows within a golden crown and call'd</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Himself a king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CAIUS LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>                  I am sorry, Cymbeline,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Thyself domestic officers&mdash;thine enemy:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Receive it from me, then: war and confusion</span><br/>
<span id='73'>In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look</span><br/>
<span id='74'>For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>I thank thee for myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Thou art welcome, Caius.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Much under him; of him I gather'd honour;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Which he to seek of me again, perforce,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect</span><br/>
<span id='81'>That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Which not to read would show the Britons cold:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>So Caesar shall not find them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CAIUS LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Let proof speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CLOTEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>His majesty bids you welcome. Make</span><br/>
<span id='87'>pastime with us a day or two, or longer: if</span><br/>
<span id='88'>you seek us afterwards in other terms, you</span><br/>
<span id='89'>shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you</span><br/>
<span id='90'>beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in</span><br/>
<span id='91'>the adventure, our crows shall fare the better</span><br/>
<span id='92'>for you; and there's an end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CAIUS LUCIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>So, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CYMBELINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>I know your master's pleasure and he mine:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>All the remain is 'Welcome!'</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h4>The same.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Knocking within. Enter a Porter</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Porter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Here's a knocking indeed! If a</span><br/>
<span id='2'>man were porter of hell-gate, he should have</span><br/>
<span id='3'>old turning the key.</span><br/>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<span id='4'>Knock,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged</span><br/>
<span id='7'>himself on the expectation of plenty: come in</span><br/>
<span id='8'>time; have napkins enow about you; here</span><br/>
<span id='9'>you'll sweat for't.</span><br/>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<span id='10'>Knock,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>knock! Who's there, in the other devil's</span><br/>
<span id='12'>name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could</span><br/>
<span id='13'>swear in both the scales against either scale;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>who committed treason enough for God's sake,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come</span><br/>
<span id='16'>in, equivocator.</span><br/>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<span id='17'>Knock,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an</span><br/>
<span id='19'>English tailor come hither, for stealing out of</span><br/>
<span id='20'>a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may</span><br/>
<span id='21'>roast your goose.</span><br/>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<span id='22'>Knock,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>knock; never at quiet! What are you? But</span><br/>
<span id='24'>this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter</span><br/>
<span id='25'>it no further: I had thought to have let in</span><br/>
<span id='26'>some of all professions that go the primrose</span><br/>
<span id='27'>way to the everlasting bonfire.</span><br/>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<span id='28'>Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.</span><br/>
<p><em>Opens the gate</em></p>
<p><em>Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>That you do lie so late?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Porter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>'Faith sir, we were carousing till the</span><br/>
<span id='32'>second cock: and drink, sir, is a great</span><br/>
<span id='33'>provoker of three things.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>What three things does drink especially provoke?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Porter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and</span><br/>
<span id='36'>urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>it provokes the desire, but it takes</span><br/>
<span id='38'>away the performance: therefore, much drink</span><br/>
<span id='39'>may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>it makes him, and it mars him; it sets</span><br/>
<span id='41'>him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and</span><br/>
<span id='43'>not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him</span><br/>
<span id='44'>in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Porter</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>That it did, sir, i' the very throat on</span><br/>
<span id='47'>me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I</span><br/>
<span id='48'>think, being too strong for him, though he took</span><br/>
<span id='49'>up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast</span><br/>
<span id='50'>him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Is thy master stirring?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MACBETH</em></p>
<span id='52'>Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LENNOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Good morrow, noble sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Good morrow, both.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Is the king stirring, worthy thane?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Not yet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>He did command me to call timely on him:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>I have almost slipp'd the hour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>I'll bring you to him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>I know this is a joyful trouble to you;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>But yet 'tis one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>The labour we delight in physics pain.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>This is the door.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>                  I'll make so bold to call,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>For 'tis my limited service.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LENNOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Goes the king hence to-day?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>He does: he did appoint so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LENNOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>The night has been unruly: where we lay,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And prophesying with accents terrible</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Of dire combustion and confused events</span><br/>
<span id='73'>New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Was feverous and did shake.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>'Twas a rough night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LENNOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>My young remembrance cannot parallel</span><br/>
<span id='78'>A fellow to it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter MACDUFF</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Cannot conceive nor name thee!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LENNOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>What's the matter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope</span><br/>
<span id='84'>The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence</span><br/>
<span id='85'>The life o' the building!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>What is 't you say? the life?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LENNOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Mean you his majesty?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight</span><br/>
<span id='89'>With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>See, and then speak yourselves.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX</em></p>
<span id='91'>Awake, awake!</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>And look on death itself! up, up, and see</span><br/>
<span id='96'>The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!</span><br/>
<span id='97'>As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Bell rings</em></p>
<p><em>Enter LADY MACBETH</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>What's the business,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley</span><br/>
<span id='101'>The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>O gentle lady,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>The repetition, in a woman's ear,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Would murder as it fell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BANQUO</em></p>
<span id='106'>O Banquo, Banquo,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Our royal master 's murder'd!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Woe, alas!</span><br/>
<span id='109'>What, in our house?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Too cruel any where.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And say it is not so.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX, with ROSS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Had I but died an hour before this chance,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>There 's nothing serious in mortality:</span><br/>
<span id='116'>All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Is left this vault to brag of.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DONALBAIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>What is amiss?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>                  You are, and do not know't:</span><br/>
<span id='121'>The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Your royal father 's murder'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>O, by whom?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LENNOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;</span><br/>
<span id='127'>So were their daggers, which unwiped we found</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Upon their pillows:</span><br/>
<span id='129'>They stared, and were distracted; no man's life</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Was to be trusted with them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>O, yet I do repent me of my fury,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>That I did kill them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Wherefore did you so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:</span><br/>
<span id='136'>The expedition my violent love</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>His silver skin laced with his golden blood;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature</span><br/>
<span id='140'>For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>That had a heart to love, and in that heart</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Courage to make 's love kno wn?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Help me hence, ho!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Look to the lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>[Aside to DONALBAIN]  Why do we hold our tongues,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>That most may claim this argument for ours?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DONALBAIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>[Aside to MALCOLM]  What should be spoken here,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>where our fate,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Let 's away;</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Our tears are not yet brew'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>[Aside to DONALBAIN]        Nor our strong sorrow</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BANQUO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Look to the lady:</span><br/>
<p><em>LADY MACBETH is carried out</em></p>
<span id='157'>And when we have our naked frailties hid,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>That suffer in exposure, let us meet,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And question this most bloody piece of work,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>In the great hand of God I stand; and thence</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Against the undivulged pretence I fight</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Of treasonous malice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>MACDUFF</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>And so do I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>ALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>So all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Let's briefly put on manly readiness,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>And meet i' the hall together.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>ALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Well contented.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>MALCOLM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>What will you do? Let's not consort with them:</span><br/>
<span id='170'>To show an unfelt sorrow is an office</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>DONALBAIN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>To Ireland, I; our separated fortune</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>The nearer bloody.</span><br/>

<span id='176'>                  This murderous shaft that's shot</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;</span><br/>
<span id='179'>And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>But shift away: there's warrant in that theft</span><br/>

<h1>King John</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>King John's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING JOHN, CARDINAL PANDULPH, and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Thus have I yielded up into your hand</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The circle of my glory.</span><br/>
<p><em>Giving the crown</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CARDINAL PANDULPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Take again</span><br/>
<span id='4'>From this my hand, as holding of the pope</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Your sovereign greatness and authority.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And from his holiness use all your power</span><br/>
<span id='8'>To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Our discontented counties do revolt;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Our people quarrel with obedience,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Swearing allegiance and the love of soul</span><br/>
<span id='12'>To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>This inundation of mistemper'd humour</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Rests by you only to be qualified:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>That present medicine must be minister'd,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Or overthrow incurable ensues.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CARDINAL PANDULPH</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>It was my breath that blew this tempest up,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>But since you are a gentle convertite,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>My tongue shall hush again this storm of war</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And make fair weather in your blustering land.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>On this Ascension-day, remember well,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Upon your oath of service to the pope,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Go I to make the French lay down their arms.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Say that before Ascension-day at noon</span><br/>
<span id='28'>My crown I should give off? Even so I have:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>I did suppose it should be on constraint:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the BASTARD</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out</span><br/>
<span id='32'>But Dover castle: London hath received,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone</span><br/>
<span id='35'>To offer service to your enemy,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And wild amazement hurries up and down</span><br/>
<span id='37'>The little number of your doubtful friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Would not my lords return to me again,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>After they heard young Arthur was alive?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>They found him dead and cast into the streets,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>An empty casket, where the jewel of life</span><br/>
<span id='42'>By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>That villain Hubert told me he did live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Be great in act, as you have been in thought;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Let not the world see fear and sad distrust</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Govern the motion of a kingly eye:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Threaten the threatener and outface the brow</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>That borrow their behaviors from the great,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Grow great by your example and put on</span><br/>
<span id='54'>The dauntless spirit of resolution.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Away, and glister like the god of war,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>When he intendeth to become the field:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Show boldness and aspiring confidence.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>What, shall they seek the lion in his den,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And fright him there? and make him tremble there?</span><br/>
<span id='60'>O, let it not be said: forage, and run</span><br/>
<span id='61'>To meet displeasure farther from the doors,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>The legate of the pope hath been with me,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And I have made a happy peace with him;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And he hath promised to dismiss the powers</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Led by the Dauphin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>O inglorious league!</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Shall we, upon the footing of our land,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Send fair-play orders and make compromise,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Insinuation, parley and base truce</span><br/>
<span id='71'>To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Mocking the air with colours idly spread,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And find no cheque? Let us, my liege, to arms:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Or if he do, let it at least be said</span><br/>
<span id='78'>They saw we had a purpose of defence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING JOHN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Have thou the ordering of this present time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BASTARD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Away, then, with good courage! yet, I know,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Our party may well meet a prouder foe.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

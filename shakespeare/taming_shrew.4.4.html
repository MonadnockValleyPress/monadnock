<h1>Taming of the Shrew</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Padua. Before Baptista's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter TRANIO, and the Pedant dressed like VINCENTIO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Pedant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Ay, what else? and but I be deceived</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Signior Baptista may remember me,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Pedant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>I warrant you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BIONDELLO</em></p>
<span id='9'>But, sir, here comes your boy;</span><br/>
<span id='10'>'Twere good he were school'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Tut, fear not me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>I told him that your father was at Venice,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BAPTISTA and LUCENTIO</em></p>
<span id='20'>Signior Baptista, you are happily met.</span><br/>
<p><em>To the Pedant</em></p>
<span id='21'>Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>I pray you stand good father to me now,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Give me Bianca for my patrimony.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Pedant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Soft son!</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua</span><br/>
<span id='26'>To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Made me acquainted with a weighty cause</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Of love between your daughter and himself:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And, for the good report I hear of you</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And for the love he beareth to your daughter</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And she to him, to stay him not too long,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>I am content, in a good father's care,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>To have him match'd; and if you please to like</span><br/>
<span id='34'>No worse than I, upon some agreement</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Me shall you find ready and willing</span><br/>
<span id='36'>With one consent to have her so bestow'd;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>For curious I cannot be with you,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Your plainness and your shortness please me well.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Right true it is, your son Lucentio here</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Or both dissemble deeply their affections:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And therefore, if you say no more than this,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>That like a father you will deal with him</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>The match is made, and all is done:</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Your son shall have my daughter with consent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best</span><br/>
<span id='50'>We be affied and such assurance ta'en</span><br/>
<span id='51'>As shall with either part's agreement stand?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And happily we might be interrupted.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Then at my lodging, an it like you:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>There doth my father lie; and there, this night,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>We'll pass the business privately and well.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Send for your daughter by your servant here:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.</span><br/>
<span id='61'>The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And bid Bianca make her ready straight;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And, if you will, tell what hath happened,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>I pray the gods she may with all my heart!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit BIONDELLO</em></p>
<span id='70'>Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>I follow you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt TRANIO, Pedant, and BAPTISTA</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter BIONDELLO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Cambio!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>What sayest thou, Biondello?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Biondello, what of that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to</span><br/>
<span id='79'>expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>I pray thee, moralize them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the</span><br/>
<span id='82'>deceiving father of a deceitful son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>And what of him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>And then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your</span><br/>
<span id='87'>command at all hours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>And what of all this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a</span><br/>
<span id='90'>counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the</span><br/>
<span id='92'>church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient</span><br/>
<span id='93'>honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for</span><br/>
<span id='95'>ever and a day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Hearest thou, Biondello?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an</span><br/>
<span id='98'>afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to</span><br/>
<span id='99'>stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against</span><br/>
<span id='102'>you come with your appendix.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>I may, and will, if she be so contented:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt?</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:</span><br/>
<span id='106'>It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

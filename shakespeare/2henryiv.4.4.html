<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING HENRY IV, the Princes Thomas of CLARENCE and Humphrey of GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now, lords, if God doth give successful end</span><br/>
<span id='2'>To this debate that bleedeth at our doors,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>We will our youth lead on to higher fields</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And draw no swords but what are sanctified.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Our navy is address'd, our power collected,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Our substitutes in absence well invested,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And every thing lies level to our wish:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Only, we want a little personal strength;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>And pause us, till these rebels, now afoot,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Come underneath the yoke of government.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Both which we doubt not but your majesty</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Shall soon enjoy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>                  Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Where is the prince your brother?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>And how accompanied?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>I do not know, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>No, my good lord; he is in presence here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>What would my lord and father?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?</span><br/>
<span id='23'>He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Thou hast a better place in his affection</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And noble offices thou mayst effect</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Of mediation, after I am dead,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Between his greatness and thy other brethren:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Nor lose the good advantage of his grace</span><br/>
<span id='31'>By seeming cold or careless of his will;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>For he is gracious, if he be observed:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>He hath a tear for pity and a hand</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Open as day for melting charity:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he's flint,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>As humorous as winter and as sudden</span><br/>
<span id='37'>As flaws congealed in the spring of day.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>His temper, therefore, must be well observed:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>But, being moody, give him line and scope,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>That the united vessel of their blood,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Mingled with venom of suggestion&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>As, force perforce, the age will pour it in&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Shall never leak, though it do work as strong</span><br/>
<span id='50'>As aconitum or rash gunpowder.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>I shall observe him with all care and love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>He is not there to-day; he dines in London.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>And how accompanied? canst thou tell that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>With Poins, and other his continual followers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>And he, the noble image of my youth,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Is overspread with them: therefore my grief</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Stretches itself beyond the hour of death:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape</span><br/>
<span id='61'>In forms imaginary the unguided days</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And rotten times that you shall look upon</span><br/>
<span id='63'>When I am sleeping with my ancestors.</span><br/>
<span id='64'>For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>When means and lavish manners meet together,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>O, with what wings shall his affections fly</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Towards fronting peril and opposed decay!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>The prince but studies his companions</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>'Tis needful that the most immodest word</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Be look'd upon and learn'd; which once attain'd,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Your highness knows, comes to no further use</span><br/>
<span id='75'>But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>The prince will in the perfectness of time</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Cast off his followers; and their memory</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Shall as a pattern or a measure live,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>By which his grace must mete the lives of others,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Turning past evils to advantages.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb</span><br/>
<span id='82'>In the dead carrion.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter WESTMORELAND</em></p>
<span id='83'>Who's here? Westmoreland?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Health to my sovereign, and new happiness</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Added to that that I am to deliver!</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Prince John your son doth kiss your grace's hand:</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings and all</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Are brought to the correction of your law;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>There is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd</span><br/>
<span id='90'>But peace puts forth her olive every where.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>The manner how this action hath been borne</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Here at more leisure may your highness read,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>With every course in his particular.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Which ever in the haunch of winter sings</span><br/>
<span id='96'>The lifting up of day.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HARCOURT</em></p>
<span id='97'>Look, here's more news.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>HARCOURT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>From enemies heaven keep your majesty;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And, when they stand against you, may they fall</span><br/>
<span id='100'>As those that I am come to tell you of!</span><br/>
<span id='101'>The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>With a great power of English and of Scots</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Are by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown:</span><br/>
<span id='104'>The manner and true order of the fight</span><br/>
<span id='105'>This packet, please it you, contains at large.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>And wherefore should these good news make me sick?</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Will fortune never come with both hands full,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>But write her fair words still in foulest letters?</span><br/>
<span id='109'>She either gives a stomach and no food;</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Such are the poor, in health; or else a feast</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And takes away the stomach; such are the rich,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>That have abundance and enjoy it not.</span><br/>
<span id='113'>I should rejoice now at this happy news;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy:</span><br/>
<span id='115'>O me! come near me; now I am much ill.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Comfort, your majesty!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>O my royal father!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Be patient, princes; you do know, these fits</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Are with his highness very ordinary.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Stand from him. Give him air; he'll straight be well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>The incessant care and labour of his mind</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in</span><br/>
<span id='125'>So thin that life looks through and will break out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>The people fear me; for they do observe</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature:</span><br/>
<span id='128'>The seasons change their manners, as the year</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Had found some months asleep and leap'd them over.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>The river hath thrice flow'd, no ebb between;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And the old folk, time's doting chronicles,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Say it did so a little time before</span><br/>
<span id='133'>That our great-grandsire, Edward, sick'd and died.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>WARWICK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Speak lower, princes, for the king recovers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>This apoplexy will certain be his end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>KING HENRY IV</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>I pray you, take me up, and bear me hence</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Into some other chamber: softly, pray.</span><br/>

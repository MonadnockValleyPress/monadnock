<h4>Scene I. A churchyard.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter two Clowns, with spades,  &amp;c</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Is she to be buried in Christian burial that</span><br/>
<span id='2'>wilfully seeks her own salvation?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave</span><br/>
<span id='4'>straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Christian burial.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her</span><br/>
<span id='7'>own defence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Why, 'tis found so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For</span><br/>
<span id='10'>here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it</span><br/>
<span id='12'>is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned</span><br/>
<span id='13'>herself wittingly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Second Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here</span><br/>
<span id='16'>stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he</span><br/>
<span id='18'>goes,&mdash;mark you that; but if the water come to him</span><br/>
<span id='19'>and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he</span><br/>
<span id='20'>that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Second Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>But is this law?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Second Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been</span><br/>
<span id='24'>a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Christian burial.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that</span><br/>
<span id='27'>great folk should have countenance in this world to</span><br/>
<span id='28'>drown or hang themselves, more than their even</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient</span><br/>
<span id='30'>gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>they hold up Adam's profession.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Second Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Was he a gentleman?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>He was the first that ever bore arms.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Second Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Why, he had none.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'</span><br/>
<span id='37'>could he dig without arms? I'll put another</span><br/>
<span id='38'>question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the</span><br/>
<span id='39'>purpose, confess thyself&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Second Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Go to.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>What is he that builds stronger than either the</span><br/>
<span id='42'>mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Second Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a</span><br/>
<span id='44'>thousand tenants.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows</span><br/>
<span id='46'>does well; but how does it well? it does well to</span><br/>
<span id='47'>those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the</span><br/>
<span id='48'>gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Second Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or</span><br/>
<span id='51'>a carpenter?'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Second Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Marry, now I can tell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>To't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Second Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Mass, I cannot tell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull</span><br/>
<span id='57'>ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when</span><br/>
<span id='58'>you are asked this question next, say 'a</span><br/>
<span id='59'>grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till</span><br/>
<span id='60'>doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a</span><br/>
<span id='61'>stoup of liquor.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Second Clown</em></p>
<p><em>He digs and sings</em></p>
<span id='62'>In youth, when I did love, did love,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Methought it was very sweet,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>O, methought, there was nothing meet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he</span><br/>
<span id='67'>sings at grave-making?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath</span><br/>
<span id='70'>the daintier sense.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>[Sings]</span><br/>
<span id='72'>But age, with his stealing steps,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Hath claw'd me in his clutch,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And hath shipped me intil the land,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>As if I had never been such.</span><br/>
<p><em>Throws up a skull</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It</span><br/>
<span id='79'>might be the pate of a politician, which this ass</span><br/>
<span id='80'>now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>might it not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>It might, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might</span><br/>
<span id='85'>be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord</span><br/>
<span id='86'>such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Ay, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and</span><br/>
<span id='89'>knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to</span><br/>
<span id='91'>see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>[Sings]</span><br/>
<span id='94'>A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>For and a shrouding sheet:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>O, a pit of clay for to be made</span><br/>
<span id='97'>For such a guest is meet.</span><br/>
<p><em>Throws up another skull</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>There's another: why may not that be the skull of a</span><br/>
<span id='99'>lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he</span><br/>
<span id='101'>suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the</span><br/>
<span id='102'>sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of</span><br/>
<span id='103'>his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be</span><br/>
<span id='104'>in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and</span><br/>
<span id='107'>the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine</span><br/>
<span id='108'>pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him</span><br/>
<span id='109'>no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than</span><br/>
<span id='110'>the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The</span><br/>
<span id='111'>very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in</span><br/>
<span id='112'>this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Not a jot more, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Is not parchment made of sheepskins?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance</span><br/>
<span id='117'>in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose</span><br/>
<span id='118'>grave's this, sirrah?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Mine, sir.</span><br/>
<p><em>Sings</em></p>
<span id='120'>O, a pit of clay for to be made</span><br/>
<span id='121'>For such a guest is meet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not</span><br/>
<span id='124'>yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:</span><br/>
<span id='126'>'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to</span><br/>
<span id='128'>you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>What man dost thou dig it for?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>For no man, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>What woman, then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>For none, neither.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Who is to be buried in't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the</span><br/>
<span id='136'>card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of</span><br/>
<span id='138'>it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the</span><br/>
<span id='139'>peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he</span><br/>
<span id='140'>gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a</span><br/>
<span id='141'>grave-maker?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day</span><br/>
<span id='143'>that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>How long is that since?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it</span><br/>
<span id='146'>was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that</span><br/>
<span id='147'>is mad, and sent into England.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits</span><br/>
<span id='150'>there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Why?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men</span><br/>
<span id='153'>are as mad as he.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>How came he mad?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>Very strangely, they say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>How strangely?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Faith, e'en with losing his wits.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>Upon what ground?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man</span><br/>
<span id='160'>and boy, thirty years.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die&mdash;as we</span><br/>
<span id='163'>have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce</span><br/>
<span id='164'>hold the laying in&mdash;he will last you some eight year</span><br/>
<span id='165'>or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Why he more than another?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that</span><br/>
<span id='168'>he will keep out water a great while; and your water</span><br/>
<span id='169'>is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth</span><br/>
<span id='171'>three and twenty years.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Whose was it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>Nay, I know not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a</span><br/>
<span id='176'>flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>This?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>First Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>E'en that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Let me see.</span><br/>
<p><em>Takes the skull</em></p>
<span id='181'>Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow</span><br/>
<span id='182'>of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath</span><br/>
<span id='183'>borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how</span><br/>
<span id='184'>abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at</span><br/>
<span id='185'>it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know</span><br/>
<span id='186'>not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your</span><br/>
<span id='187'>gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one</span><br/>
<span id='189'>now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let</span><br/>
<span id='191'>her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must</span><br/>
<span id='192'>come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell</span><br/>
<span id='193'>me one thing.</span><br/>

<p><em>Puts down the skull</em></p>

<span id='204'>No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with</span><br/>

<span id='207'>Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of</span><br/>
<span id='208'>earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he</span><br/>

<span id='210'>Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,</span><br/>

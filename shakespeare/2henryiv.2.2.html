<h4>London. Another street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Before God, I am exceeding weary.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not</span><br/>
<span id='3'>have attached one of so high blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Faith, it does me; though it discolours the</span><br/>
<span id='5'>complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth</span><br/>
<span id='6'>it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as</span><br/>
<span id='8'>to remember so weak a composition.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>small beer. But, indeed, these humble</span><br/>
<span id='12'>considerations make me out of love with my</span><br/>
<span id='13'>greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember</span><br/>
<span id='14'>thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to</span><br/>
<span id='15'>take note how many pair of silk stockings thou</span><br/>
<span id='16'>hast, viz. these, and those that were thy</span><br/>
<span id='17'>peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy</span><br/>
<span id='18'>shirts, as, one for superfluity, and another for</span><br/>
<span id='19'>use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better</span><br/>
<span id='20'>than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when</span><br/>
<span id='21'>thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done</span><br/>
<span id='22'>a great while, because the rest of thy low</span><br/>
<span id='23'>countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins</span><br/>
<span id='25'>of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the</span><br/>
<span id='26'>midwives say the children are not in the fault;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are</span><br/>
<span id='28'>mightily strengthened.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good</span><br/>
<span id='31'>young princes would do so, their fathers being so</span><br/>
<span id='32'>sick as yours at this time is?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you</span><br/>
<span id='37'>will tell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be</span><br/>
<span id='39'>sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell</span><br/>
<span id='40'>thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a</span><br/>
<span id='41'>better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad</span><br/>
<span id='42'>indeed too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Very hardly upon such a subject.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's</span><br/>
<span id='45'>book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and</span><br/>
<span id='46'>persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell</span><br/>
<span id='47'>thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so</span><br/>
<span id='48'>sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art</span><br/>
<span id='49'>hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>The reason?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>It would be every man's thought; and thou art a</span><br/>
<span id='54'>blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never</span><br/>
<span id='55'>a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way</span><br/>
<span id='56'>better than thine: every man would think me an</span><br/>
<span id='57'>hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most</span><br/>
<span id='58'>worshipful thought to think so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Why, because you have been so lewd and so much</span><br/>
<span id='60'>engraffed to Falstaff.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>And to thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it</span><br/>
<span id='63'>with my own ears: the worst that they can say of</span><br/>
<span id='64'>me is that I am a second brother and that I am a</span><br/>
<span id='65'>proper fellow of my hands; and those two things, I</span><br/>
<span id='66'>confess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BARDOLPH and Page</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>And the boy that I gave Falstaff: a' had him from</span><br/>
<span id='68'>me Christian; and look, if the fat villain have not</span><br/>
<span id='69'>transformed him ape.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>God save your grace!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>And yours, most noble Bardolph!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must you</span><br/>
<span id='73'>be blushing? wherefore blush you now? What a</span><br/>
<span id='74'>maidenly man-at-arms are you become! Is't such a</span><br/>
<span id='75'>matter to get a pottle-pot's maidenhead?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Page</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>A' calls me e'en now, my lord, through a red</span><br/>
<span id='77'>lattice, and I could discern no part of his face</span><br/>
<span id='78'>from the window: at last I spied his eyes, and</span><br/>
<span id='79'>methought he had made two holes in the ale-wife's</span><br/>
<span id='80'>new petticoat and so peeped through.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Has not the boy profited?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Page</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Away, you rascally Althaea's dream, away!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>Page</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamed she was delivered</span><br/>
<span id='86'>of a fire-brand; and therefore I call him her dream.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>A crown's worth of good interpretation: there 'tis,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>boy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>O, that this good blossom could be kept from</span><br/>
<span id='90'>cankers! Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>An you do not make him hanged among you, the</span><br/>
<span id='92'>gallows shall have wrong.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>And how doth thy master, Bardolph?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Well, my lord. He heard of your grace's coming to</span><br/>
<span id='95'>town: there's a letter for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Delivered with good respect. And how doth the</span><br/>
<span id='97'>martlemas, your master?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>In bodily health, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Marry, the immortal part needs a physician; but</span><br/>
<span id='100'>that moves not him: though that be sick, it dies</span><br/>
<span id='101'>not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my</span><br/>
<span id='103'>dog; and he holds his place; for look you how be writes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>[Reads]  'John Falstaff, knight,'&mdash;every man must</span><br/>
<span id='105'>know that, as oft as he has occasion to name</span><br/>
<span id='106'>himself: even like those that are kin to the king;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>for they never prick their finger but they say,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>'There's some of the king's blood spilt.' 'How</span><br/>
<span id='109'>comes that?' says he, that takes upon him not to</span><br/>
<span id='110'>conceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower's</span><br/>
<span id='111'>cap, 'I am the king's poor cousin, sir.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch it</span><br/>
<span id='113'>from Japhet. But to the letter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>[Reads]  'Sir John Falstaff, knight, to the son of</span><br/>
<span id='115'>the king, nearest his father, Harry Prince of</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Wales, greeting.' Why, this is a certificate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Peace!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>[Reads]  'I will imitate the honourable Romans in</span><br/>
<span id='119'>brevity:' he sure means brevity in breath,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>short-winded. 'I commend me to thee, I commend</span><br/>
<span id='121'>thee, and I leave thee. Be not too familiar with</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Poins; for he misuses thy favours so much, that he</span><br/>
<span id='123'>swears thou art to marry his sister Nell. Repent</span><br/>
<span id='124'>at idle times as thou mayest; and so, farewell.</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Thine, by yea and no, which is as much as to</span><br/>
<span id='126'>say, as thou usest him, JACK FALSTAFF with my</span><br/>
<span id='127'>familiars, JOHN with my brothers and sisters,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>and SIR JOHN with all Europe.'</span><br/>
<span id='129'>My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>That's to make him eat twenty of his words. But do</span><br/>
<span id='131'>you use me thus, Ned? must I marry your sister?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and the</span><br/>
<span id='134'>spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Is your master here in London?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Yea, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Where sups he? doth the old boar feed in the old frank?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>What company?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>Page</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Sup any women with him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>Page</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly and</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Mistress Doll Tearsheet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>What pagan may that be?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>Page</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town</span><br/>
<span id='147'>bull. Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>I am your shadow, my lord; I'll follow you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to your</span><br/>
<span id='150'>master that I am yet come to town: there's for</span><br/>
<span id='151'>your silence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>BARDOLPH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>I have no tongue, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>Page</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>And for mine, sir, I will govern it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Fare you well; go.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt BARDOLPH and Page</em></p>
<span id='155'>This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>I warrant you, as common as the way between Saint</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Alban's and London.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>How might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-night</span><br/>
<span id='159'>in his true colours, and not ourselves be seen?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>POINS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and wait</span><br/>
<span id='161'>upon him at his table as drawers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>From a God to a bull? a heavy decension! it was</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Jove's case. From a prince to a prentice? a low</span><br/>
<span id='164'>transformation! that shall be mine; for in every</span><br/>
<span id='165'>thing the purpose must weigh with the folly.</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Follow me, Ned.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

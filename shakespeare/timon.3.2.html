<h1>Timon of Athens</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>A public place.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LUCILIUS, with three Strangers</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LUCILIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend, and</span><br/>
<span id='2'>an honourable gentleman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Stranger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>We know him for no less, though we are but strangers</span><br/>
<span id='4'>to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and</span><br/>
<span id='5'>which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's</span><br/>
<span id='6'>happy hours are done and past, and his estate</span><br/>
<span id='7'>shrinks from him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>LUCILIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Stranger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow</span><br/>
<span id='11'>so many talents, nay, urged extremely for't and</span><br/>
<span id='12'>showed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LUCILIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>How!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Second Stranger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>I tell you, denied, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>LUCILIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>What a strange case was that! now, before the gods,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man!</span><br/>
<span id='17'>there was very little honour showed in't. For my own</span><br/>
<span id='18'>part, I must needs confess, I have received some</span><br/>
<span id='19'>small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels</span><br/>
<span id='20'>and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should</span><br/>
<span id='22'>ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SERVILIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SERVILIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>See, by good hap, yonder's my lord;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord,&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>To LUCIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LUCILIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Servilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very</span><br/>
<span id='27'>exquisite friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SERVILIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>May it please your honour, my lord hath sent&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LUCILIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared to</span><br/>
<span id='30'>that lord; he's ever sending: how shall I thank</span><br/>
<span id='31'>him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SERVILIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>requesting your lordship to supply his instant use</span><br/>
<span id='34'>with so many talents.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LUCILIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>I know his lordship is but merry with me;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SERVILIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>If his occasion were not virtuous,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>I should not urge it half so faithfully.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>LUCILIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>SERVILIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Upon my soul,'tis true, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LUCILIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself</span><br/>
<span id='43'>against such a good time, when I might ha' shown</span><br/>
<span id='44'>myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I</span><br/>
<span id='45'>should purchase the day before for a little part,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>before the gods, I am not able to do,&mdash;the more</span><br/>
<span id='48'>beast, I say:&mdash;I was sending to use Lord Timon</span><br/>
<span id='49'>myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would</span><br/>
<span id='50'>not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now.</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I</span><br/>
<span id='52'>hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>because I have no power to be kind: and tell him</span><br/>
<span id='54'>this from me, I count it one of my greatest</span><br/>
<span id='55'>afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an</span><br/>
<span id='56'>honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you</span><br/>
<span id='57'>befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SERVILIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Yes, sir, I shall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LUCILIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit SERVILIUS</em></p>
<span id='60'>True as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And he that's once denied will hardly speed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>First Stranger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Do you observe this, Hostilius?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Second Stranger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Ay, too well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>First Stranger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the</span><br/>
<span id='65'>same piece</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him</span><br/>
<span id='67'>His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in</span><br/>
<span id='68'>My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And kept his credit with his purse,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And yet&mdash;O, see the monstrousness of man</span><br/>
<span id='74'>When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>He does deny him, in respect of his,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>What charitable men afford to beggars.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Third Stranger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Religion groans at it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>First Stranger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>For mine own part,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>I never tasted Timon in my life,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Nor came any of his bounties over me,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And honourable carriage,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Had his necessity made use of me,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>I would have put my wealth into donation,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And the best half should have return'd to him,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Men must learn now with pity to dispense;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>For policy sits above conscience.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>King Lear</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Before Gloucester's castle. Kent in the stocks.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING LEAR, Fool, and Gentleman</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And not send back my messenger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>As I learn'd,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>The night before there was no purpose in them</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Of this remove.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>                  Hail to thee, noble master!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Ha!</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Makest thou this shame thy pastime?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>No, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied</span><br/>
<span id='11'>by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by</span><br/>
<span id='12'>the loins, and men by the legs: when a man's</span><br/>
<span id='13'>over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden</span><br/>
<span id='14'>nether-stocks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>What's he that hath so much thy place mistook</span><br/>
<span id='16'>To set thee here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>                  It is both he and she;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Your son and daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>No.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Yes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>No, I say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>I say, yea.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>No, no, they would not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Yes, they have.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>By Jupiter, I swear, no.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>By Juno, I swear, ay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>They durst not do 't;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>They could not, would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>To do upon respect such violent outrage:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Thou mightst deserve, or they impose, this usage,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Coming from us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>                  My lord, when at their home</span><br/>
<span id='34'>I did commend your highness' letters to them,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Ere I was risen from the place that show'd</span><br/>
<span id='36'>My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth</span><br/>
<span id='38'>From Goneril his mistress salutations;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Which presently they read: on whose contents,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Commanded me to follow, and attend</span><br/>
<span id='43'>The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And meeting here the other messenger,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Being the very fellow that of late</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Display'd so saucily against your highness,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Having more man than wit about me, drew:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>He raised the house with loud and coward cries.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Your son and daughter found this trespass worth</span><br/>
<span id='51'>The shame which here it suffers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Winter's not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Fathers that wear rags</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Do make their children blind;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>But fathers that bear bags</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Shall see their children kind.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Fortune, that arrant whore,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Ne'er turns the key to the poor.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours</span><br/>
<span id='60'>for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>With the earl, sir, here within.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Follow me not;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Stay here.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Made you no more offence but what you speak of?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>None.</span><br/>
<span id='69'>How chance the king comes with so small a train?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>And thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that</span><br/>
<span id='71'>question, thou hadst well deserved it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Why, fool?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee</span><br/>
<span id='74'>there's no labouring i' the winter. All that follow</span><br/>
<span id='75'>their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and</span><br/>
<span id='76'>there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him</span><br/>
<span id='77'>that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel</span><br/>
<span id='78'>runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with</span><br/>
<span id='79'>following it: but the great one that goes up the</span><br/>
<span id='80'>hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man</span><br/>
<span id='81'>gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I</span><br/>
<span id='82'>would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>That sir which serves and seeks for gain,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And follows but for form,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Will pack when it begins to rain,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And leave thee in the storm,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>But I will tarry; the fool will stay,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And let the wise man fly:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>The knave turns fool that runs away;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>The fool no knave, perdy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>KENT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Where learned you this, fool?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Fool</strong></span>

<span id='92'>Not i' the stocks, fool.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?</span><br/>
<span id='94'>They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>The images of revolt and flying off.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Fetch me a better answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>My dear lord,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>You know the fiery quality of the duke;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>How unremoveable and fix'd he is</span><br/>
<span id='100'>In his own course.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Ay, my good lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>No, but not yet: may be he is not well:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Infirmity doth still neglect all office</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves</span><br/>
<span id='114'>When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind</span><br/>
<span id='115'>To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And am fall'n out with my more headier will,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>To take the indisposed and sickly fit</span><br/>
<span id='118'>For the sound man. Death on my state! wherefore</span><br/>
<p><em>Looking on KENT</em></p>
<span id='119'>Should he sit here? This act persuades me</span><br/>
<span id='120'>That this remotion of the duke and her</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Is practise only. Give me my servant forth.</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Till it cry sleep to death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>I would have all well betwixt you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>O me, my heart, my rising heart! but, down!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Fool</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels</span><br/>
<span id='129'>when she put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'em</span><br/>
<span id='130'>o' the coxcombs with a stick, and cried 'Down,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that, in pure</span><br/>
<span id='132'>kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Good morrow to you both.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>

<span id='134'>Hail to your grace!</span><br/>
<p><em>KENT is set at liberty</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>I am glad to see your highness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Regan, I think you are; I know what reason</span><br/>
<span id='137'>I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Sepulchring an adultress.</span><br/>
<p><em>To KENT</em></p>
<span id='140'>O, are you free?</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:</span><br/>
<p><em>Points to his heart</em></p>
<span id='144'>I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe</span><br/>
<span id='145'>With how depraved a quality&mdash;O Regan!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.</span><br/>
<span id='147'>You less know how to value her desert</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Than she to scant her duty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Say, how is that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>I cannot think my sister in the least</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance</span><br/>
<span id='152'>She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>As clears her from all blame.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>My curses on her!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>                  O, sir, you are old.</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Nature in you stands on the very verge</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Of her confine: you should be ruled and led</span><br/>
<span id='159'>By some discretion, that discerns your state</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>That to our sister you do make return;</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Say you have wrong'd her, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Ask her forgiveness?</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Do you but mark how this becomes the house:</span><br/>
<span id='165'>'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;</span><br/>
<p><em>Kneeling</em></p>
<span id='166'>Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg</span><br/>
<span id='167'>That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Return you to my sister.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>[Rising]  Never, Regan:</span><br/>
<span id='171'>She hath abated me of half my train;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:</span><br/>
<span id='174'>All the stored vengeances of heaven fall</span><br/>
<span id='175'>On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>You taking airs, with lameness!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>Fie, sir, fie!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>To fall and blast her pride!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>When the rash mood is on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee</span><br/>
<span id='188'>To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>And in conclusion to oppose the bolt</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Against my coming in: thou better know'st</span><br/>
<span id='192'>The offices of nature, bond of childhood,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Wherein I thee endow'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='196'>Good sir, to the purpose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>Who put my man i' the stocks?</span><br/>
<p><em>Tucket within</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>What trumpet's that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>I know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>That she would soon be here.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter OSWALD</em></p>
<span id='201'>Is your lady come?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='202'>This is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd pride</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Out, varlet, from my sight!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>What means your grace?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GONERIL</em></p>
<span id='208'>If you do love old men, if your sweet sway</span><br/>
<span id='209'>Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!</span><br/>
<p><em>To GONERIL</em></p>
<span id='211'>Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?</span><br/>
<span id='212'>O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>GONERIL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='213'>Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?</span><br/>
<span id='214'>All's not offence that indiscretion finds</span><br/>
<span id='215'>And dotage terms so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>O sides, you are too tough;</span><br/>
<span id='217'>Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>CORNWALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='218'>I set him there, sir: but his own disorders</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Deserved much less advancement.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='220'>You! did you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>REGAN</strong></span>

<span id='221'>I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.</span><br/>
<span id='222'>If, till the expiration of your month,</span><br/>
<span id='223'>You will return and sojourn with my sister,</span><br/>
<span id='224'>Dismissing half your train, come then to me:</span><br/>
<span id='225'>I am now from home, and out of that provision</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Which shall be needful for your entertainment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='227'>Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?</span><br/>
<span id='228'>No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose</span><br/>
<span id='229'>To wage against the enmity o' the air;</span><br/>
<span id='230'>To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?</span><br/>
<span id='232'>Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took</span><br/>
<span id='233'>Our youngest born, I could as well be brought</span><br/>
<span id='234'>To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg</span><br/>
<span id='235'>To keep base life afoot. Return with her?</span><br/>
<span id='236'>Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter</span><br/>
<span id='237'>To this detested groom.</span><br/>

<span id='240'>I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:</span><br/>
<span id='241'>We'll no more meet, no more see one another:</span><br/>
<span id='242'>But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;</span><br/>
<span id='243'>Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,</span><br/>
<span id='244'>Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,</span><br/>
<span id='245'>A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,</span><br/>
<span id='246'>In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;</span><br/>
<span id='247'>Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:</span><br/>
<span id='248'>I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,</span><br/>

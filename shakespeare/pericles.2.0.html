<h3>Act II, Prologue</h3>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GOWER</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GOWER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Here have you seen a mighty king</span><br/>
<span id='2'>His child, I wis, to incest bring;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>A better prince and benign lord,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>That will prove awful both in deed and word.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Be quiet then as men should be,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Till he hath pass'd necessity.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>I'll show you those in troubles reign,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Losing a mite, a mountain gain.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>The good in conversation,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To whom I give my benison,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Is still at Tarsus, where each man</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Thinks all is writ he speken can;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And, to remember what he does,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Build his statue to make him glorious:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>But tidings to the contrary</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Are brought your eyes; what need speak I?</span><br/>
<p>DUMB SHOW.</p>
<p><em>Enter at one door PERICLES talking with CLEON; all  the train with them. Enter at another door a  Gentleman, with a letter to PERICLES; PERICLES  shows the letter to CLEON; gives the Messenger a  reward, and knights him. Exit PERICLES at one door, and CLEON at another</em></p>
<span id='17'>Good Helicane, that stay'd at home,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Not to eat honey like a drone</span><br/>
<span id='19'>From others' labours; for though he strive</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To killen bad, keep good alive;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And to fulfil his prince' desire,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Sends word of all that haps in Tyre:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>How Thaliard came full bent with sin</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And had intent to murder him;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And that in Tarsus was not best</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Longer for him to make his rest.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>He, doing so, put forth to seas,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Where when men been, there's seldom ease;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>For now the wind begins to blow;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Thunder above and deeps below</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Make such unquiet, that the ship</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Should house him safe is wreck'd and split;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And he, good prince, having all lost,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>By waves from coast to coast is tost:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>All perishen of man, of pelf,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Ne aught escapen but himself;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Till fortune, tired with doing bad,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Threw him ashore, to give him glad:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And here he comes. What shall be next,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Pardon old Gower,&mdash;this longs the text.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

<h1>Henry VI, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</h3>
<h4>France. Before Orleans.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Sound a flourish. Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER, marching with drum and Soldiers</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens</span><br/>
<span id='2'>So in the earth, to this day is not known:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Late did he shine upon the English side;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>What towns of any moment but we have?</span><br/>
<span id='6'>At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ALENCON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Either they must be dieted like mules</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And have their provender tied to their mouths</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>REIGNIER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And he may well in fretting spend his gall,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Nor men nor money hath he to make war.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Now for the honour of the forlorn French!</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Him I forgive my death that killeth me</span><br/>
<span id='21'>When he sees me go back one foot or fly.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
<p><em>Here alarum; they are beaten back by the English with great loss. Re-enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Who ever saw the like? what men have I!</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>But that they left me 'midst my enemies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>REIGNIER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Salisbury is a desperate homicide;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>He fighteth as one weary of his life.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>The other lords, like lions wanting food,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ALENCON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>During the time Edward the Third did reign.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>More truly now may this be verified;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>For none but Samsons and Goliases</span><br/>
<span id='34'>It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose</span><br/>
<span id='36'>They had such courage and audacity?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Of old I know them; rather with their teeth</span><br/>
<span id='40'>The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>REIGNIER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>I think, by some odd gimmors or device</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Their arms are set like clocks, stiff to strike on;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>By my consent, we'll even let them alone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ALENCON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Be it so.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Be not dismay'd, for succor is at hand:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>A holy maid hither with me I bring,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Which by a vision sent to her from heaven</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Ordained is to raise this tedious siege</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And drive the English forth the bounds of France.</span><br/>
<span id='55'>The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:</span><br/>
<span id='57'>What's past and what's to come she can descry.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>For they are certain and unfallible.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Go, call her in.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit BASTARD OF ORLEANS</em></p>
<span id='61'>But first, to try her skill,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:</span><br/>
<span id='64'>By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, with JOAN LA PUCELLE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>REIGNIER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Reignier, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>I know thee well, though never seen before.</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Be not amazed, there's nothing hid from me:</span><br/>
<span id='70'>In private will I talk with thee apart.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>REIGNIER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>She takes upon her bravely at first dash.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased</span><br/>
<span id='76'>To shine on my contemptible estate:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>God's mother deigned to appear to me</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And in a vision full of majesty</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Will'd me to leave my base vocation</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And free my country from calamity:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Her aid she promised and assured success:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>In complete glory she reveal'd herself;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And, whereas I was black and swart before,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>With those clear rays which she infused on me</span><br/>
<span id='87'>That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Ask me what question thou canst possible,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And I will answer unpremeditated:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>My courage try by combat, if thou darest,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Otherwise I renounce all confidence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>I am prepared: here is my keen-edged sword,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>The which at Touraine, in Saint Katharine's</span><br/>
<span id='102'>churchyard,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>And while I live, I'll ne'er fly from a man.</span><br/>
<p><em>Here they fight, and JOAN LA PUCELLE overcomes</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Stay, stay thy hands! thou art an Amazon</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And fightest with the sword of Deborah.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Impatiently I burn with thy desire;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Let me thy servant and not sovereign be:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>I must not yield to any rites of love,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>For my profession's sacred from above:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>When I have chased all thy foes from hence,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Then will I think upon a recompense.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>REIGNIER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ALENCON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>REIGNIER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>ALENCON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>He may mean more than we poor men do know:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>REIGNIER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>My lord, where are you? what devise you on?</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Shall we give over Orleans, or no?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Why, no, I say, distrustful recreants!</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>JOAN LA PUCELLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.</span><br/>
<span id='132'>This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Since I have entered into these wars.</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Glory is like a circle in the water,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.</span><br/>
<span id='138'>With Henry's death the English circle ends;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Dispersed are the glories it included.</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Now am I like that proud insulting ship</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Thou with an eagle art inspired then.</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Helen, the mother of great Constantine,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters, were like thee.</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>How may I reverently worship thee enough?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>ALENCON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>REIGNIER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours;</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Drive them from Orleans and be immortalized.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>CHARLES</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Presently we'll try: come, let's away about it:</span><br/>
<span id='152'>No prophet will I trust, if she prove false.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

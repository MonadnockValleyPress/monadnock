<h1>Julius Caesar</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The Forum.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng of Citizens</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Citizens</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Cassius, go you into the other street,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And part the numbers.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And public reasons shall be rendered</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Of Caesar's death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>                  I will hear Brutus speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>When severally we hear them rendered.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS goes into the pulpit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Be patient till the last.</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my</span><br/>
<span id='15'>cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me</span><br/>
<span id='16'>for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that</span><br/>
<span id='17'>you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and</span><br/>
<span id='18'>awake your senses, that you may the better judge.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar</span><br/>
<span id='21'>was no less than his. If then that friend demand</span><br/>
<span id='22'>why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>&mdash;Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and</span><br/>
<span id='25'>die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live</span><br/>
<span id='26'>all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was</span><br/>
<span id='28'>valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I</span><br/>
<span id='29'>slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his</span><br/>
<span id='30'>fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his</span><br/>
<span id='31'>ambition. Who is here so base that would be a</span><br/>
<span id='32'>bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If</span><br/>
<span id='34'>any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so</span><br/>
<span id='35'>vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>None, Brutus, none.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Then none have I offended. I have done no more to</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of</span><br/>
<span id='40'>his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not</span><br/>
<span id='41'>extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences</span><br/>
<span id='42'>enforced, for which he suffered death.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body</em></p>
<span id='43'>Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>though he had no hand in his death, shall receive</span><br/>
<span id='45'>the benefit of his dying, a place in the</span><br/>
<span id='46'>commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I depart,&mdash;that, as I slew my best lover for the</span><br/>
<span id='48'>good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>when it shall please my country to need my death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Live, Brutus! live, live!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Bring him with triumph home unto his house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Give him a statue with his ancestors.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Let him be Caesar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Fourth Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>                  Caesar's better parts</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Shall be crown'd in Brutus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>We'll bring him to his house</span><br/>
<span id='57'>With shouts and clamours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>My countrymen,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Peace, ho!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Good countrymen, let me depart alone,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>By our permission, is allow'd to make.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>I do entreat you, not a man depart,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Let him go up into the public chair;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Goes into the pulpit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Fourth Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>What does he say of Brutus?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>He says, for Brutus' sake,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>He finds himself beholding to us all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Fourth Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>This Caesar was a tyrant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Nay, that's certain:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>We are blest that Rome is rid of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>You gentle Romans,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Citizens</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Peace, ho! let us hear him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>The evil that men do lives after them;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>The good is oft interred with their bones;</span><br/>
<span id='86'>So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:</span><br/>
<span id='88'>If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>For Brutus is an honourable man;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>So are they all, all honourable men&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>He was my friend, faithful and just to me:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>But Brutus says he was ambitious;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And Brutus is an honourable man.</span><br/>
<span id='97'>He hath brought many captives home to Rome</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</span><br/>
<span id='100'>When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And Brutus is an honourable man.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>You all did see that on the Lupercal</span><br/>
<span id='105'>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And, sure, he is an honourable man.</span><br/>
<span id='109'>I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>But here I am to speak what I do know.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>You all did love him once, not without cause:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?</span><br/>
<span id='113'>O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And I must pause till it come back to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>If thou consider rightly of the matter,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Caesar has had great wrong.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Has he, masters?</span><br/>
<span id='121'>I fear there will a worse come in his place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>Fourth Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>If it be found so, some will dear abide it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>Fourth Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Now mark him, he begins again to speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>But yesterday the word of Caesar might</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Have stood against the world; now lies he there.</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And none so poor to do him reverence.</span><br/>
<span id='131'>O masters, if I were disposed to stir</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Who, you all know, are honourable men:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>I will not do them wrong; I rather choose</span><br/>
<span id='136'>To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Than I will wrong such honourable men.</span><br/>
<span id='138'>But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Let but the commons hear this testament&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='142'>And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds</span><br/>
<span id='143'>And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And, dying, mention it within their wills,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Bequeathing it as a rich legacy</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Unto their issue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Fourth Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;</span><br/>
<span id='151'>It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.</span><br/>
<span id='152'>You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;</span><br/>
<span id='153'>And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>It will inflame you, it will make you mad:</span><br/>
<span id='155'>'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;</span><br/>
<span id='156'>For, if you should, O, what would come of it!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Fourth Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?</span><br/>
<span id='160'>I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>I fear I wrong the honourable men</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>Fourth Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>They were traitors: honourable men!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>The will! the testament!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>You will compel me, then, to read the will?</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>And let me show you him that made the will.</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Several Citizens</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>Come down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Descend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>You shall have leave.</span><br/>
<p><em>ANTONY comes down</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>Fourth Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>A ring; stand round.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>First Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>Room for Antony, most noble Antony.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>Several Citizens</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>Stand back; room; bear back.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>ANTONY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.</span><br/>
<span id='179'>You all do know this mantle: I remember</span><br/>
<span id='180'>The first time ever Caesar put it on;</span><br/>
<span id='181'>'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>That day he overcame the Nervii:</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:</span><br/>
<span id='184'>See what a rent the envious Casca made:</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;</span><br/>
<span id='186'>And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>As rushing out of doors, to be resolved</span><br/>
<span id='189'>If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;</span><br/>
<span id='190'>For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!</span><br/>
<span id='192'>This was the most unkindest cut of all;</span><br/>
<span id='193'>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;</span><br/>
<span id='196'>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Even at the base of Pompey's statua,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.</span><br/>
<span id='199'>O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.</span><br/>
<span id='202'>O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel</span><br/>
<span id='203'>The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.</span><br/>

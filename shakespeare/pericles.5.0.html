<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Prologue</h3>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GOWER</em>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GOWER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Into an honest house, our story says.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>She sings like one immortal, and she dances</span><br/>
<span id='4'>As goddess-like to her admired lays;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composes</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>That even her art sisters the natural roses;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>That pupils lacks she none of noble race,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain</span><br/>
<span id='11'>She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>And to her father turn our thoughts again,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived</span><br/>
<span id='17'>God Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whence</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And to him in his barge with fervor hies.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>In your supposing once more put your sight</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Where what is done in action, more, if might,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

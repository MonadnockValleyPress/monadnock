<h1>Henry IV, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</H3>
<h4>London. An apartment of the Prince's.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack</span><br/>
<span id='3'>and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon</span><br/>
<span id='4'>benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to</span><br/>
<span id='5'>demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the</span><br/>
<span id='7'>day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes</span><br/>
<span id='8'>capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the</span><br/>
<span id='9'>signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself</span><br/>
<span id='10'>a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no</span><br/>
<span id='11'>reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand</span><br/>
<span id='12'>the time of the day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take</span><br/>
<span id='14'>purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not</span><br/>
<span id='15'>by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God</span><br/>
<span id='17'>save thy grace,&mdash;majesty I should say, for grace</span><br/>
<span id='18'>thou wilt have none,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>What, none?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to</span><br/>
<span id='21'>prologue to an egg and butter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not</span><br/>
<span id='24'>us that are squires of the night's body be called</span><br/>
<span id='25'>thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's</span><br/>
<span id='26'>foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the</span><br/>
<span id='27'>moon; and let men say we be men of good government,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and</span><br/>
<span id='29'>chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the</span><br/>
<span id='31'>fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and</span><br/>
<span id='32'>flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold</span><br/>
<span id='34'>most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most</span><br/>
<span id='35'>dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with</span><br/>
<span id='36'>swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'</span><br/>
<span id='37'>now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder</span><br/>
<span id='38'>and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my</span><br/>
<span id='40'>hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And</span><br/>
<span id='42'>is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and</span><br/>
<span id='44'>thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a</span><br/>
<span id='45'>buff jerkin?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a</span><br/>
<span id='48'>time and oft.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>and where it would not, I have used my credit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent</span><br/>
<span id='54'>that thou art heir apparent&mdash;But, I prithee, sweet</span><br/>
<span id='55'>wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when</span><br/>
<span id='56'>thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is</span><br/>
<span id='57'>with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do</span><br/>
<span id='58'>not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>No; thou shalt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have</span><br/>
<span id='62'>the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my</span><br/>
<span id='64'>humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell</span><br/>
<span id='65'>you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>For obtaining of suits?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman</span><br/>
<span id='68'>hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy</span><br/>
<span id='69'>as a gib cat or a lugged bear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Moor-ditch?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed</span><br/>
<span id='75'>the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young</span><br/>
<span id='76'>prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more</span><br/>
<span id='77'>with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a</span><br/>
<span id='78'>commodity of good names were to be bought. An old</span><br/>
<span id='79'>lord of the council rated me the other day in the</span><br/>
<span id='80'>street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet</span><br/>
<span id='81'>he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and</span><br/>
<span id='82'>yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the</span><br/>
<span id='84'>streets, and no man regards it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able</span><br/>
<span id='86'>to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon</span><br/>
<span id='87'>me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew</span><br/>
<span id='88'>thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man</span><br/>
<span id='89'>should speak truly, little better than one of the</span><br/>
<span id='90'>wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give</span><br/>
<span id='91'>it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>I'll be damned for never a king's son in</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Christendom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I</span><br/>
<span id='96'>do not, call me villain and baffle me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying</span><br/>
<span id='98'>to purse-taking.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a</span><br/>
<span id='100'>man to labour in his vocation.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter POINS</em></p>
<span id='101'>Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a</span><br/>
<span id='102'>match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what</span><br/>
<span id='103'>hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the</span><br/>
<span id='104'>most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to</span><br/>
<span id='105'>a true man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Good morrow, Ned.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?</span><br/>
<span id='108'>what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how</span><br/>
<span id='109'>agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou</span><br/>
<span id='110'>soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira</span><br/>
<span id='111'>and a cold capon's leg?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have</span><br/>
<span id='113'>his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of</span><br/>
<span id='114'>proverbs: he will give the devil his due.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four</span><br/>
<span id='118'>o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going</span><br/>
<span id='119'>to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders</span><br/>
<span id='120'>riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards</span><br/>
<span id='121'>for you all; you have horses for yourselves:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke</span><br/>
<span id='123'>supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it</span><br/>
<span id='124'>as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff</span><br/>
<span id='125'>your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry</span><br/>
<span id='126'>at home and be hanged.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>I'll hang you for going.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>You will, chops?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Hal, wilt thou make one?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good</span><br/>
<span id='133'>fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood</span><br/>
<span id='134'>royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Why, that's well said.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>I care not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:</span><br/>
<span id='141'>I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure</span><br/>
<span id='142'>that he shall go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>FALSTAFF</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him</span><br/>
<span id='144'>the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may</span><br/>
<span id='145'>move and what he hears may be believed, that the</span><br/>
<span id='146'>true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false</span><br/>
<span id='147'>thief; for the poor abuses of the time want</span><br/>
<span id='148'>countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Falstaff</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us</span><br/>
<span id='151'>to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot</span><br/>
<span id='152'>manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill</span><br/>
<span id='153'>shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:</span><br/>
<span id='154'>yourself and I will not be there; and when they</span><br/>
<span id='155'>have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut</span><br/>
<span id='156'>this head off from my shoulders.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>How shall we part with them in setting forth?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>Why, we will set forth before or after them, and</span><br/>
<span id='159'>appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at</span><br/>
<span id='160'>our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure</span><br/>
<span id='161'>upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have</span><br/>
<span id='162'>no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our</span><br/>
<span id='164'>horses, by our habits and by every other</span><br/>
<span id='165'>appointment, to be ourselves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them</span><br/>
<span id='167'>in the wood; our vizards we will change after we</span><br/>
<span id='168'>leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram</span><br/>
<span id='169'>for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Well, for two of them, I know them to be as</span><br/>
<span id='172'>true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the</span><br/>
<span id='173'>third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll</span><br/>
<span id='174'>forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the</span><br/>
<span id='175'>incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will</span><br/>
<span id='176'>tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at</span><br/>
<span id='177'>least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what</span><br/>
<span id='178'>extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this</span><br/>
<span id='179'>lies the jest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things</span><br/>
<span id='181'>necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;</span><br/>
<span id='182'>there I'll sup. Farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>POINS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>Farewell, my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Poins</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>PRINCE HENRY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>I know you all, and will awhile uphold</span><br/>
<span id='185'>The unyoked humour of your idleness:</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Yet herein will I imitate the sun,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Who doth permit the base contagious clouds</span><br/>
<span id='188'>To smother up his beauty from the world,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>That, when he please again to be himself,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>By breaking through the foul and ugly mists</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.</span><br/>
<span id='193'>If all the year were playing holidays,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>To sport would be as tedious as to work;</span><br/>
<span id='195'>But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.</span><br/>
<span id='197'>So, when this loose behavior I throw off</span><br/>
<span id='198'>And pay the debt I never promised,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>By how much better than my word I am,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;</span><br/>
<span id='201'>And like bright metal on a sullen ground,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes</span><br/>
<span id='204'>Than that which hath no foil to set it off.</span><br/>
<span id='205'>I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Redeeming time when men think least I will.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

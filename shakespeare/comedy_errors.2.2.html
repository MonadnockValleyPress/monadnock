<blockquote>
<em>Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out</span><br/>
<span id='4'>By computation and mine host's report.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I could not speak with Dromio since at first</span><br/>
<span id='6'>I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DROMIO of Syracuse</em></p>
<span id='7'>How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?</span><br/>
<span id='8'>As you love strokes, so jest with me again.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>You know no Centaur? you received no gold?</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?</span><br/>
<span id='11'>My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>That thus so madly thou didst answer me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Even now, even here, not half an hour since.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>I did not see you since you sent me hence,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>I am glad to see you in this merry vein:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.</span><br/>
<p><em>Beating him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Upon what bargain do you give it me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Because that I familiarly sometimes</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Do use you for my fool and chat with you,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Your sauciness will jest upon my love</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And make a common of my serious hours.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>If you will jest with me, know my aspect,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And fashion your demeanor to my looks,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Or I will beat this method in your sconce.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I</span><br/>
<span id='36'>had rather have it a head: an you use these blows</span><br/>
<span id='37'>long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce</span><br/>
<span id='38'>it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Dost thou not know?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Shall I tell you why?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath</span><br/>
<span id='44'>a wherefore.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Why, first,&mdash;for flouting me; and then, wherefore&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>For urging it the second time to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme</span><br/>
<span id='49'>nor reason?</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Well, sir, I thank you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Thank me, sir, for what?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for</span><br/>
<span id='54'>something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>In good time, sir; what's that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Basting.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Your reason?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another</span><br/>
<span id='62'>dry basting.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a</span><br/>
<span id='64'>time for all things.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>By what rule, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald</span><br/>
<span id='68'>pate of father Time himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Let's hear it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>There's no time for a man to recover his hair that</span><br/>
<span id='71'>grows bald by nature.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>May he not do it by fine and recovery?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the</span><br/>
<span id='74'>lost hair of another man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>so plentiful an excrement?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth</span><br/>
<span id='83'>it in a kind of jollity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>For what reason?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>For two; and sound ones too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Nay, not sound, I pray you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Sure ones, then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Certain ones then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Name them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>The one, to save the money that he spends in</span><br/>
<span id='92'>trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not</span><br/>
<span id='93'>drop in his porridge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>You would all this time have proved there is no</span><br/>
<span id='95'>time for all things.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair</span><br/>
<span id='97'>lost by nature.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>But your reason was not substantial, why there is no</span><br/>
<span id='99'>time to recover.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore</span><br/>
<span id='101'>to the world's end will have bald followers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:</span><br/>
<span id='103'>But, soft! who wafts us yonder?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA</em></p>

<span id='105'>Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>I am not Adriana nor thy wife.</span><br/>

<span id='110'>That never touch well welcome to thy hand,</span><br/>

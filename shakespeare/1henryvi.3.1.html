<h1>Henry VI, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>London. The Parliament-house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, EXETER, GLOUCESTER,  WARWICK, SOMERSET, and SUFFOLK; the BISHOP OF  WINCHESTER, RICHARD PLANTAGENET, and others.  GLOUCESTER offers to put up a bill; BISHOP OF WINCHESTER snatches it, and tears it</em>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>BISHOP</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>With written pamphlets studiously devised,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Do it without invention, suddenly;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>As I with sudden and extemporal speech</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Purpose to answer what thou canst object.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Think not, although in writing I preferr'd</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>That therefore I have forged, or am not able</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>No, prelate; such is thy audacious wickedness,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>As very infants prattle of thy pride.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Thou art a most pernicious usurer,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Forward by nature, enemy to peace;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems</span><br/>
<span id='21'>A man of thy profession and degree;</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And for thy treachery, what's more manifest?</span><br/>
<span id='23'>In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>As well at London bridge as at the Tower.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt</span><br/>
<span id='27'>From envious malice of thy swelling heart.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>BISHOP</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe</span><br/>
<span id='30'>To give me hearing what I shall reply.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>As he will have me, how am I so poor?</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Or how haps it I seek not to advance</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?</span><br/>
<span id='35'>And for dissension, who preferreth peace</span><br/>
<span id='36'>More than I do?&mdash;except I be provoked.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>No, my good lords, it is not that offends;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>It is not that that hath incensed the duke:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>It is, because no one should sway but he;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>No one but he should be about the king;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And that engenders thunder in his breast</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And makes him roar these accusations forth.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>But he shall know I am as good&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>As good!</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Thou bastard of my grandfather!</span><br/>
<span id='46'>BISHOP</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>But one imperious in another's throne?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Am I not protector, saucy priest?</span><br/>
<span id='50'>BISHOP</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>And am not I a prelate of the church?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And useth it to patronage his theft.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>BISHOP</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Unreverent Gloster!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Thou art reverent</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>BISHOP</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Rome shall remedy this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Roam thither, then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>My lord, it were your duty to forbear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Ay, see the bishop be not overborne.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Methinks my lord should be religious</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And know the office that belongs to such.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Methinks his lordship should be humbler;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>it fitteth not a prelate so to plead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SOMERSET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>State holy or unhallow'd, what of that?</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Is not his grace protector to the king?</span><br/>
<span id='70'>RICHARD</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>[Aside]  Plantagenet, I see, must hold his tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?'</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Else would I have a fling at Winchester.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>The special watchmen of our English weal,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>I would prevail, if prayers might prevail,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>To join your hearts in love and amity.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>O, what a scandal is it to our crown,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>That two such noble peers as ye should jar!</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Civil dissension is a viperous worm</span><br/>
<span id='83'>That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.</span><br/>
<p><em>A noise within, 'Down with the tawny-coats!'</em></p>
<span id='84'>What tumult's this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>An uproar, I dare warrant,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Begun through malice of the bishop's men.</span><br/>
<p><em>A noise again, 'Stones! stones!' Enter Mayor</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Mayor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Pity the city of London, pity us!</span><br/>
<span id='89'>The bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Forbidden late to carry any weapon,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And banding themselves in contrary parts</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Do pelt so fast at one another's pate</span><br/>
<span id='94'>That many have their giddy brains knock'd out:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Our windows are broke down in every street</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Serving-men, in skirmish, with bloody pates</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>We charge you, on allegiance to ourself,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>To hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Pray, uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>First Serving-man	Nay, if we be forbidden stones,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>We'll fall to it with our teeth.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Second Serving-man	Do what ye dare, we are as resolute.</span><br/>
<p><em>Skirmish again</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>You of my household, leave this peevish broil</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And set this unaccustom'd fight aside.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Third Serving-man	My lord, we know your grace to be a man</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Just and upright; and, for your royal birth,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Inferior to none but to his majesty:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And ere that we will suffer such a prince,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>So kind a father of the commonweal,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>We and our wives and children all will fight</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.</span><br/>
<span id='113'>First Serving-man	Ay, and the very parings of our nails</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Shall pitch a field when we are dead.</span><br/>
<p><em>Begin again</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Stay, stay, I say!</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And if you love me, as you say you do,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Let me persuade you to forbear awhile.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold</span><br/>
<span id='120'>My sighs and tears and will not once relent?</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Who should be pitiful, if you be not?</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Or who should study to prefer a peace.</span><br/>
<span id='123'>If holy churchmen take delight in broils?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Yield, my lord protector; yield, Winchester;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Except you mean with obstinate repulse</span><br/>
<span id='126'>To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.</span><br/>
<span id='127'>You see what mischief and what murder too</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Hath been enacted through your enmity;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood.</span><br/>
<span id='130'>BISHOP</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>He shall submit, or I will never yield.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Compassion on the king commands me stoop;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Should ever get that privilege of me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the duke</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Hath banish'd moody discontented fury,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>As by his smoothed brows it doth appear:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Why look you still so stern and tragical?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach</span><br/>
<span id='141'>That malice was a great and grievous sin;</span><br/>
<span id='142'>And will not you maintain the thing you teach,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>But prove a chief offender in the same?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Sweet king! the bishop hath a kindly gird.</span><br/>
<span id='145'>For shame, my lord of Winchester, relent!</span><br/>
<span id='146'>What, shall a child instruct you what to do?</span><br/>
<span id='147'>BISHOP</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee;</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.</span><br/>

<blockquote>
<span id='167'>Well urged, my Lord of Warwick: or sweet prince,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>And if your grace mark every circumstance,</span><br/>

<span id='170'>Especially for those occasions</span><br/>
<span id='171'>At Eltham Place I told your majesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>

<span id='172'>And those occasions, uncle, were of force:</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is</span><br/>

<span id='181'>That doth belong unto the house of York,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>From whence you spring by lineal descent.</span><br/>
<span id='183'>RICHARD</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>PLANTAGENET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>Thy humble servant vows obedience</span><br/>
<span id='185'>And humble service till the point of death.</span><br/>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>

<span id='186'>Stoop then and set your knee against my foot;</span><br/>
<span id='187'>And, in reguerdon of that duty done,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>I gird thee with the valiant sword of York:</span><br/>

<span id='197'>Now will it best avail your majesty</span><br/>

<span id='199'>The presence of a king engenders love</span><br/>

<span id='201'>As it disanimates his enemies.</span><br/>

<span id='speech50'><strong>KING HENRY VI</strong></span>

<span id='215'>Was in the mouth of every sucking babe;</span><br/>
<span id='216'>That Henry born at Monmouth should win all</span><br/>
<span id='217'>And Henry born at Windsor lose all:</span><br/>

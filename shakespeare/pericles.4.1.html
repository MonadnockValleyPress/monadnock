<h1>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Tarsus. An open place near the sea-shore.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DIONYZA and LEONINE</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DIONYZA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do't:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Inflame too nicely; nor let pity, which</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Even women have cast off, melt thee, but be</span><br/>
<span id='8'>A soldier to thy purpose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>LEONINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>I will do't; but yet she is a goodly creature.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DIONYZA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>The fitter, then, the gods should have her. Here</span><br/>
<span id='11'>she comes weeping for her only mistress' death.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Thou art resolved?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LEONINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>I am resolved.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MARINA, with a basket of flowers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>No, I will rob Tellus of her weed,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>To strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The purple violets, and marigolds,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>While summer-days do last. Ay me! poor maid,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Born in a tempest, when my mother died,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>This world to me is like a lasting storm,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Whirring me from my friends.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DIONYZA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>How now, Marina! why do you keep alone?</span><br/>
<span id='23'>How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Consume your blood with sorrowing: you have</span><br/>
<span id='25'>A nurse of me. Lord, how your favour's changed</span><br/>
<span id='26'>With this unprofitable woe!</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>No, I pray you;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>I'll not bereave you of your servant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DIONYZA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Come, come;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>I love the king your father, and yourself,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>With more than foreign heart. We every day</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Expect him here: when he shall come and find</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken</span><br/>
<span id='40'>No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve</span><br/>
<span id='42'>That excellent complexion, which did steal</span><br/>
<span id='43'>The eyes of young and old. Care not for me</span><br/>
<span id='44'>I can go home alone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Well, I will go;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>But yet I have no desire to it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DIONYZA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Come, come, I know 'tis good for you.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Remember what I have said.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>LEONINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>I warrant you, madam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DIONYZA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>I'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Pray, walk softly, do not heat your blood:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>What! I must have a care of you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>My thanks, sweet madam.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit DIONYZA</em></p>
<span id='55'>Is this wind westerly that blows?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LEONINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>South-west.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>When I was born, the wind was north.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LEONINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Was't so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>My father, as nurse said, did never fear,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>But cried 'Good seaman!' to the sailors, galling</span><br/>
<span id='61'>His kingly hands, haling ropes;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea</span><br/>
<span id='63'>That almost burst the deck.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LEONINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>When was this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>When I was born:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Never was waves nor wind more violent;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>And from the ladder-tackle washes off</span><br/>
<span id='68'>A canvas-climber. 'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And with a dropping industry they skip</span><br/>
<span id='70'>From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and</span><br/>
<span id='71'>The master calls, and trebles their confusion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LEONINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Come, say your prayers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>What mean you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LEONINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>If you require a little space for prayer,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>I grant it: pray; but be not tedious,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>For the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn</span><br/>
<span id='77'>To do my work with haste.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Why will you kill me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LEONINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>To satisfy my lady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Why would she have me kill'd?</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Now, as I can remember, by my troth,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>I never did her hurt in all my life:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To any living creature: believe me, la,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:</span><br/>
<span id='86'>I trod upon a worm against my will,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>But I wept for it. How have I offended,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Wherein my death might yield her any profit,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Or my life imply her any danger?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LEONINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>My commission</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Is not to reason of the deed, but do it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>MARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>You will not do't for all the world, I hope.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>You are well favour'd, and your looks foreshow</span><br/>
<span id='94'>You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Good sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Your lady seeks my life; come you between,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And save poor me, the weaker.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LEONINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>I am sworn,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And will dispatch.</span><br/>
<p><em>He seizes her</em></p>
<p><em>Enter Pirates</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>First Pirate</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Hold, villain!</span><br/>
<p><em>LEONINE runs away</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Second Pirate</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>A prize! a prize!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Third Pirate</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Half-part, mates, half-part.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Come, let's have her aboard suddenly.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Pirates with MARINA</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter LEONINE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>LEONINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And they have seized Marina. Let her go:</span><br/>
<span id='107'>There's no hope she will return. I'll swear she's dead,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Not carry her aboard. If she remain,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

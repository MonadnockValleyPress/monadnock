<h1>Measure for Measure</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene II</H3>
<h4>A room in the prison.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Provost and POMPEY</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a</span><br/>
<span id='3'>married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never</span><br/>
<span id='4'>cut off a woman's head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a</span><br/>
<span id='6'>direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio</span><br/>
<span id='7'>and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common</span><br/>
<span id='8'>executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if</span><br/>
<span id='9'>you will take it on you to assist him, it shall</span><br/>
<span id='10'>redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have</span><br/>
<span id='11'>your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance</span><br/>
<span id='12'>with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a</span><br/>
<span id='13'>notorious bawd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I</span><br/>
<span id='16'>would be glad to receive some instruction from my</span><br/>
<span id='17'>fellow partner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ABHORSON</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ABHORSON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Do you call, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in</span><br/>
<span id='21'>your execution. If you think it meet, compound with</span><br/>
<span id='22'>him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if</span><br/>
<span id='23'>not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He</span><br/>
<span id='24'>cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ABHORSON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn</span><br/>
<span id='27'>the scale.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Pray, sir, by your good favour,&mdash;for surely, sir, a</span><br/>
<span id='29'>good favour you have, but that you have a hanging</span><br/>
<span id='30'>look,&mdash;do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ABHORSON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Ay, sir; a mystery</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and</span><br/>
<span id='33'>your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I</span><br/>
<span id='36'>should be hanged, I cannot imagine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>ABHORSON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Sir, it is a mystery.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Proof?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ABHORSON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be</span><br/>
<span id='40'>too little for your thief, your true man thinks it</span><br/>
<span id='41'>big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your</span><br/>
<span id='42'>thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's</span><br/>
<span id='43'>apparel fits your thief.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Provost</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Are you agreed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is</span><br/>
<span id='46'>a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth</span><br/>
<span id='47'>oftener ask forgiveness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe</span><br/>
<span id='49'>to-morrow four o'clock.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ABHORSON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>POMPEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have</span><br/>
<span id='52'>occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find</span><br/>
<span id='53'>me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you</span><br/>
<span id='54'>a good turn.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt POMPEY and ABHORSON</em></p>
<span id='56'>The one has my pity; not a jot the other,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Being a murderer, though he were my brother.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CLAUDIO</em></p>
<span id='58'>Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour</span><br/>
<span id='62'>When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>He will not wake.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>                  Who can do good on him?</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Well, go, prepare yourself.</span><br/>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<span id='66'>But, hark, what noise?</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Heaven give your spirits comfort!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit CLAUDIO</em></p>
<span id='68'>By and by.</span><br/>
<span id='69'>I hope it is some pardon or reprieve</span><br/>
<span id='70'>For the most gentle Claudio.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before</em></p>
<span id='71'>Welcome father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>The best and wholesomest spirts of the night</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>None, since the curfew rung.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Not Isabel?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>          No.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>                  They will, then, ere't be long.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>What comfort is for Claudio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>There's some in hope.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>It is a bitter deputy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:</span><br/>
<span id='83'>He doth with holy abstinence subdue</span><br/>
<span id='84'>That in himself which he spurs on his power</span><br/>
<span id='85'>To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>But this being so, he's just.</span><br/>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<span id='88'>Now are they come.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Provost</em></p>
<span id='89'>This is a gentle provost: seldom when</span><br/>
<span id='90'>The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.</span><br/>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<span id='91'>How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste</span><br/>
<span id='92'>That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Provost</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>There he must stay until the officer</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>But he must die to-morrow?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>None, sir, none.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>As near the dawning, provost, as it is,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>You shall hear more ere morning.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Happily</span><br/>
<span id='101'>You something know; yet I believe there comes</span><br/>
<span id='102'>No countermand; no such example have we:</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Besides, upon the very siege of justice</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Lord Angelo hath to the public ear</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Profess'd the contrary.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
<span id='106'>This is his lordship's man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>And here comes Claudio's pardon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>Messenger</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>[Giving a paper]</span><br/>
<span id='109'>My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this</span><br/>
<span id='110'>further charge, that you swerve not from the</span><br/>
<span id='111'>smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or</span><br/>
<span id='112'>other circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>it is almost day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>I shall obey him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>[Aside]  This is his pardon, purchased by such sin</span><br/>
<span id='116'>For which the pardoner himself is in.</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Hence hath offence his quick celerity,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>When it is born in high authority:</span><br/>
<span id='119'>When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>That for the fault's love is the offender friended.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Now, sir, what news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss</span><br/>
<span id='123'>in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted</span><br/>
<span id='124'>putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Pray you, let's hear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>[Reads]</span><br/>
<span id='127'>'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Claudio be executed by four of the clock; and in the</span><br/>
<span id='129'>afternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>let me have Claudio's head sent me by five. Let</span><br/>
<span id='131'>this be duly performed; with a thought that more</span><br/>
<span id='132'>depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail</span><br/>
<span id='133'>not to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'</span><br/>
<span id='134'>What say you to this, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the</span><br/>
<span id='136'>afternoon?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one</span><br/>
<span id='138'>that is a prisoner nine years old.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>How came it that the absent duke had not either</span><br/>
<span id='140'>delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I</span><br/>
<span id='141'>have heard it was ever his manner to do so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>It is now apparent?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Most manifest, and not denied by himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how</span><br/>
<span id='148'>seems he to be touched?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but</span><br/>
<span id='150'>as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless</span><br/>
<span id='151'>of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of</span><br/>
<span id='152'>mortality, and desperately mortal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>He wants advice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty</span><br/>
<span id='155'>of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he</span><br/>
<span id='156'>would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days</span><br/>
<span id='157'>entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if</span><br/>
<span id='158'>to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming</span><br/>
<span id='159'>warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>More of him anon. There is written in your brow,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not</span><br/>
<span id='162'>truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the</span><br/>
<span id='163'>boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is</span><br/>
<span id='165'>no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath</span><br/>
<span id='166'>sentenced him. To make you understand this in a</span><br/>
<span id='167'>manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;</span><br/>
<span id='168'>for the which you are to do me both a present and a</span><br/>
<span id='169'>dangerous courtesy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>Pray, sir, in what?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>In the delaying death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>and an express command, under penalty, to deliver</span><br/>
<span id='174'>his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case</span><br/>
<span id='175'>as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my</span><br/>
<span id='177'>instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine</span><br/>
<span id='178'>be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was</span><br/>
<span id='182'>the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his</span><br/>
<span id='183'>death: you know the course is common. If any thing</span><br/>
<span id='184'>fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good</span><br/>
<span id='185'>fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead</span><br/>
<span id='186'>against it with my life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>To him, and to his substitutes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>You will think you have made no offence, if the duke</span><br/>
<span id='191'>avouch the justice of your dealing?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>But what likelihood is in that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see</span><br/>
<span id='194'>you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor</span><br/>
<span id='195'>persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go</span><br/>
<span id='196'>further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the</span><br/>
<span id='198'>duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the</span><br/>
<span id='199'>signet is not strange to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>Provost</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>I know them both.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>DUKE VINCENTIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>The contents of this is the return of the duke: you</span><br/>
<span id='202'>shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you</span><br/>
<span id='203'>shall find, within these two days he will be here.</span><br/>
<span id='204'>This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this</span><br/>
<span id='205'>very day receives letters of strange tenor;</span><br/>
<span id='206'>perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering</span><br/>
<span id='207'>into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what</span><br/>
<span id='208'>is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the</span><br/>
<span id='209'>shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these</span><br/>
<span id='210'>things should be: all difficulties are but easy</span><br/>
<span id='211'>when they are known. Call your executioner, and off</span><br/>
<span id='212'>with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present</span><br/>
<span id='213'>shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you</span><br/>
<span id='214'>are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Come away; it is almost clear dawn.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Coriolanus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene III</H3>
<h4>The same. The Forum.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter seven or eight Citizens</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>First Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>We may, sir, if we will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a</span><br/>
<span id='4'>power that we have no power to do; for if he show us</span><br/>
<span id='5'>his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our</span><br/>
<span id='6'>tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if</span><br/>
<span id='7'>he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him</span><br/>
<span id='8'>our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is</span><br/>
<span id='9'>monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>were to make a monster of the multitude: of the</span><br/>
<span id='11'>which we being members, should bring ourselves to be</span><br/>
<span id='12'>monstrous members.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>And to make us no better thought of, a little help</span><br/>
<span id='14'>will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he</span><br/>
<span id='15'>himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>We have been called so of many; not that our heads</span><br/>
<span id='17'>are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and</span><br/>
<span id='19'>truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of</span><br/>
<span id='20'>one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>and their consent of one direct way should be at</span><br/>
<span id='22'>once to all the points o' the compass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would</span><br/>
<span id='24'>fly?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's</span><br/>
<span id='26'>will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but</span><br/>
<span id='27'>if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Why that way?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts</span><br/>
<span id='30'>melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return</span><br/>
<span id='31'>for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Are you all resolved to give your voices? But</span><br/>
<span id='34'>that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I</span><br/>
<span id='35'>say, if he would incline to the people, there was</span><br/>
<span id='36'>never a worthier man.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility, with MENENIUS</em></p>
<span id='37'>Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his</span><br/>
<span id='38'>behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to</span><br/>
<span id='39'>come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and</span><br/>
<span id='40'>by threes. He's to make his requests by</span><br/>
<span id='41'>particulars; wherein every one of us has a single</span><br/>
<span id='42'>honour, in giving him our own voices with our own</span><br/>
<span id='43'>tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how</span><br/>
<span id='44'>you shall go by him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>All</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Content, content.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Citizens</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>O sir, you are not right: have you not known</span><br/>
<span id='47'>The worthiest men have done't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>What must I say?</span><br/>
<span id='49'>'I Pray, sir'&mdash;Plague upon't! I cannot bring</span><br/>
<span id='50'>My tongue to such a pace:&mdash;'Look, sir, my wounds!</span><br/>
<span id='51'>I got them in my country's service, when</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran</span><br/>
<span id='53'>From the noise of our own drums.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>O me, the gods!</span><br/>
<span id='55'>You must not speak of that: you must desire them</span><br/>
<span id='56'>To think upon you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>                  Think upon me! hang 'em!</span><br/>
<span id='58'>I would they would forget me, like the virtues</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Which our divines lose by 'em.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>You'll mar all:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>In wholesome manner.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Bid them wash their faces</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And keep their teeth clean.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter two of the Citizens</em></p>
<span id='65'>So, here comes a brace.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter a third Citizen</em></p>
<span id='66'>You know the cause, air, of my standing here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Mine own desert.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Your own desert!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Ay, but not mine own desire.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>How not your own desire?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the</span><br/>
<span id='73'>poor with begging.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to</span><br/>
<span id='75'>gain by you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>First Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>The price is to ask it kindly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to</span><br/>
<span id='79'>show you, which shall be yours in private. Your</span><br/>
<span id='80'>good voice, sir; what say you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>You shall ha' it, worthy sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices</span><br/>
<span id='83'>begged. I have your alms: adieu.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>But this is something odd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>An 'twere to give again,&mdash;but 'tis no matter.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt the three Citizens</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter two other Citizens</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your</span><br/>
<span id='87'>voices that I may be consul, I have here the</span><br/>
<span id='88'>customary gown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>Fourth Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>You have deserved nobly of your country, and you</span><br/>
<span id='90'>have not deserved nobly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Your enigma?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>Fourth Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have</span><br/>
<span id='93'>been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved</span><br/>
<span id='94'>the common people.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>You should account me the more virtuous that I have</span><br/>
<span id='96'>not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my</span><br/>
<span id='97'>sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer</span><br/>
<span id='98'>estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account</span><br/>
<span id='99'>gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is</span><br/>
<span id='100'>rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise</span><br/>
<span id='101'>the insinuating nod and be off to them most</span><br/>
<span id='102'>counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the</span><br/>
<span id='103'>bewitchment of some popular man and give it</span><br/>
<span id='104'>bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>I may be consul.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>Fifth Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give</span><br/>
<span id='107'>you our voices heartily.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>Fourth Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>You have received many wounds for your country.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I</span><br/>
<span id='110'>will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Both Citizens</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Most sweet voices!</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Better it is to die, better to starve,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:</span><br/>
<span id='118'>What custom wills, in all things should we do't,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>The dust on antique time would lie unswept,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>And mountainous error be too highly heapt</span><br/>
<span id='121'>For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Let the high office and the honour go</span><br/>
<span id='123'>To one that would do thus. I am half through;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter three Citizens more</em></p>
<span id='125'>Here come more voices.</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Your voices: for your voices I have fought;</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six</span><br/>
<span id='129'>I have seen and heard of; for your voices have</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Done many things, some less, some more your voices:</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Indeed I would be consul.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Sixth Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest</span><br/>
<span id='133'>man's voice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Seventh Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>and make him good friend to the people!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>All Citizens</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Worthy voices!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter MENENIUS, with BRUTUS and SICINIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Endue you with the people's voice: remains</span><br/>
<span id='140'>That, in the official marks invested, you</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Anon do meet the senate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Is this done?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>The custom of request you have discharged:</span><br/>
<span id='144'>The people do admit you, and are summon'd</span><br/>
<span id='145'>To meet anon, upon your approbation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>Where? at the senate-house?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>There, Coriolanus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>May I change these garments?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>You may, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>CORIOLANUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Repair to the senate-house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>I'll keep you company. Will you along?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>We stay here for the people.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Fare you well.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS</em></p>
<span id='155'>He has it now, and by his looks methink</span><br/>
<span id='156'>'Tis warm at 's heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.</span><br/>
<span id='158'>will you dismiss the people?</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Citizens</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>How now, my masters! have you chose this man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>First Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>He has our voices, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Certainly</span><br/>
<span id='165'>He flouted us downright.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>First Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says</span><br/>
<span id='168'>He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us</span><br/>
<span id='169'>His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>Why, so he did, I am sure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>Citizens</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>No, no; no man saw 'em.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>He said he had wounds, which he could show</span><br/>
<span id='173'>in private;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>But by your voices, will not so permit me;</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Your most sweet voices: now you have left</span><br/>
<span id='180'>your voices,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>Why either were you ignorant to see't,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness</span><br/>
<span id='184'>To yield your voices?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>Could you not have told him</span><br/>
<span id='186'>As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>But was a petty servant to the state,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>He was your enemy, ever spake against</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Your liberties and the charters that you bear</span><br/>
<span id='190'>I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving</span><br/>
<span id='191'>A place of potency and sway o' the state,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>If he should still malignantly remain</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might</span><br/>
<span id='194'>Be curses to yourselves? You should have said</span><br/>
<span id='195'>That as his worthy deeds did claim no less</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Would think upon you for your voices and</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Translate his malice towards you into love,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Standing your friendly lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='200'>Thus to have said,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit</span><br/>
<span id='202'>And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Either his gracious promise, which you might,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>As cause had call'd you up, have held him to</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Which easily endures not article</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler</span><br/>
<span id='209'>And pass'd him unelected.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>Did you perceive</span><br/>
<span id='211'>He did solicit you in free contempt</span><br/>
<span id='212'>When he did need your loves, and do you think</span><br/>
<span id='213'>That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies</span><br/>
<span id='215'>No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry</span><br/>
<span id='216'>Against the rectorship of judgment?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>Have you</span><br/>
<span id='218'>Ere now denied the asker? and now again</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow</span><br/>
<span id='220'>Your sued-for tongues?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>Third Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>Second Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='222'>And will deny him:</span><br/>
<span id='223'>I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>First Citizen</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='224'>I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='225'>Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,</span><br/>
<span id='226'>They have chose a consul that will from them take</span><br/>
<span id='227'>Their liberties; make them of no more voice</span><br/>
<span id='228'>Than dogs that are as often beat for barking</span><br/>
<span id='229'>As therefore kept to do so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='230'>Let them assemble,</span><br/>
<span id='231'>And on a safer judgment all revoke</span><br/>
<span id='232'>Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,</span><br/>
<span id='233'>And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not</span><br/>
<span id='234'>With what contempt he wore the humble weed,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,</span><br/>
<span id='236'>Thinking upon his services, took from you</span><br/>
<span id='237'>The apprehension of his present portance,</span><br/>
<span id='238'>Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion</span><br/>
<span id='239'>After the inveterate hate he bears you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='240'>Lay</span><br/>
<span id='241'>A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,</span><br/>
<span id='242'>No impediment between, but that you must</span><br/>
<span id='243'>Cast your election on him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='244'>Say, you chose him</span><br/>

<span id='246'>By your own true affections, and that your minds,</span><br/>
<span id='247'>Preoccupied with what you rather must do</span><br/>
<span id='248'>Than what you should, made you against the grain</span><br/>
<span id='249'>To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.</span><br/>

<span id='250'>Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.</span><br/>
<span id='251'>How youngly he began to serve his country,</span><br/>
<span id='252'>How long continued, and what stock he springs of,</span><br/>
<span id='253'>The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came</span><br/>
<span id='254'>That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,</span><br/>
<span id='255'>Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;</span><br/>
<span id='256'>Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,</span><br/>
<span id='257'>That our beat water brought by conduits hither;</span><br/>
<span id='258'>And  [Censorinus,]  nobly named so,</span><br/>
<span id='259'>Twice being  [by the people chosen]  censor,</span><br/>
<span id='260'>Was his great ancestor.</span><br/>

<span id='261'>One thus descended,</span><br/>
<span id='262'>That hath beside well in his person wrought</span><br/>
<span id='263'>To be set high in place, we did commend</span><br/>
<span id='264'>To your remembrances: but you have found,</span><br/>
<span id='265'>Scaling his present bearing with his past,</span><br/>
<span id='266'>That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke</span><br/>
<span id='267'>Your sudden approbation.</span><br/>

<span id='speech83'><strong>BRUTUS</strong></a>

<span id='268'>Say, you ne'er had done't&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='269'>Harp on that still&mdash;but by our putting on;</span><br/>
<span id='270'>And presently, when you have drawn your number,</span><br/>

<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Wilds in Gloucestershire.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND, with Forces</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Believe me, noble lord,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:</span><br/>
<span id='4'>These high wild hills and rough uneven ways</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Making the hard way sweet and delectable.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>But I bethink me what a weary way</span><br/>
<span id='9'>From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found</span><br/>
<span id='10'>In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The tediousness and process of my travel:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have</span><br/>
<span id='14'>The present benefit which I possess;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And hope to joy is little less in joy</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done</span><br/>
<span id='18'>By sight of what I have, your noble company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Of much less value is my company</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Than your good words. But who comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HENRY PERCY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>It is my son, young Harry Percy,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Harry, how fares your uncle?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HENRY PERCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Why, is he not with the queen?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>HENRY PERCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Broken his staff of office and dispersed</span><br/>
<span id='28'>The household of the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>What was his reason?</span><br/>
<span id='30'>He was not so resolved when last we spake together.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>HENRY PERCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover</span><br/>
<span id='35'>What power the Duke of York had levied there;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HENRY PERCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>No, my good lord, for that is not forgot</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>I never in my life did look on him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>HENRY PERCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>My gracious lord, I tender you my service,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Which elder days shall ripen and confirm</span><br/>
<span id='45'>To more approved service and desert.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I count myself in nothing else so happy</span><br/>
<span id='48'>As in a soul remembering my good friends;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>It shall be still thy true love's recompense:</span><br/>
<span id='51'>My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Keeps good old York there with his men of war?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HENRY PERCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>None else of name and noble estimate.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LORD ROSS and LORD WILLOUGHBY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues</span><br/>
<span id='61'>A banish'd traitor: all my treasury</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Shall be your love and labour's recompense.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LORD ROSS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LORD WILLOUGHBY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>And far surmounts our labour to attain it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LORD BERKELEY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LORD BERKELEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>My lord, my answer is&mdash;to Lancaster;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And I am come to seek that name in England;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And I must find that title in your tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Before I make reply to aught you say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LORD BERKELEY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning</span><br/>
<span id='76'>To raze one title of your honour out:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>From the most gracious regent of this land,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on</span><br/>
<span id='80'>To take advantage of the absent time</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And fright our native peace with self-born arms.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DUKE OF YORK attended</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>I shall not need transport my words by you;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!</span><br/>
<p><em>Kneels</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Whose duty is deceiveable and false.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>My gracious uncle&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Tut, tut!</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace'</span><br/>
<span id='90'>In an ungracious mouth is but profane.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?</span><br/>
<span id='93'>But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march</span><br/>
<span id='94'>So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Frighting her pale-faced villages with war</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And ostentation of despised arms?</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And in my loyal bosom lies his power.</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Were I but now the lord of such hot youth</span><br/>
<span id='101'>As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>From forth the ranks of many thousand French,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And minister correction to thy fault!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>On what condition stands it and wherein?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Even in condition of the worst degree,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>In gross rebellion and detested treason:</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Before the expiration of thy time,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>In braving arms against thy sovereign.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>But as I come, I come for Lancaster.</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:</span><br/>
<span id='118'>You are my father, for methinks in you</span><br/>
<span id='119'>I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd</span><br/>
<span id='121'>A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away</span><br/>
<span id='123'>To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?</span><br/>
<span id='124'>If that my cousin king be King of England,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.</span><br/>
<span id='126'>You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.</span><br/>
<span id='130'>I am denied to sue my livery here,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And yet my letters-patents give me leave:</span><br/>
<span id='132'>My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And these and all are all amiss employ'd.</span><br/>
<span id='134'>What would you have me do? I am a subject,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And therefore, personally I lay my claim</span><br/>
<span id='137'>To my inheritance of free descent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>The noble duke hath been too much abused.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>LORD ROSS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>It stands your grace upon to do him right.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>LORD WILLOUGHBY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Base men by his endowments are made great.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>My lords of England, let me tell you this:</span><br/>
<span id='142'>I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs</span><br/>
<span id='143'>And laboured all I could to do him right;</span><br/>
<span id='144'>But in this kind to come, in braving arms,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Be his own carver and cut out his way,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>To find out right with wrong, it may not be;</span><br/>
<span id='147'>And you that do abet him in this kind</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>The noble duke hath sworn his coming is</span><br/>
<span id='150'>But for his own; and for the right of that</span><br/>
<span id='151'>We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:</span><br/>
<span id='154'>I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Because my power is weak and all ill left:</span><br/>
<span id='156'>But if I could, by Him that gave me life,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>I would attach you all and make you stoop</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>But since I cannot, be it known to you</span><br/>
<span id='160'>I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Unless you please to enter in the castle</span><br/>
<span id='162'>And there repose you for this night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>An offer, uncle, that we will accept:</span><br/>
<span id='164'>But we must win your grace to go with us</span><br/>
<span id='165'>To Bristol castle, which they say is held</span><br/>
<span id='166'>By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>The caterpillars of the commonwealth,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;</span><br/>
<span id='170'>For I am loath to break our country's laws.</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Things past redress are now with me past care.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

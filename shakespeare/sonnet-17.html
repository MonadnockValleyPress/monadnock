<h3>XVII</h3>
<p>
Who will believe my verse in time to come,<br/>
If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?<br/>
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb<br/>
Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts. <br/>
If I could write the beauty of your eyes,<br/>
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,<br/>
The age to come would say 'This poet lies;<br/>
Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'<br/>
So should my papers, yellow'd with their age,<br/>
Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,<br/>
And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage<br/>
And stretched metre of an antique song:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But were some child of yours alive that time,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should live twice,&#151;in it, and in my rhyme.<br/>

<em>Enter EDMUND, with a letter</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law</span><br/>
<span id='2'>My services are bound. Wherefore should I</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Stand in the plague of custom, and permit</span><br/>
<span id='4'>The curiosity of nations to deprive me,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?</span><br/>
<span id='7'>When my dimensions are as well compact,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>My mind as generous, and my shape as true,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us</span><br/>
<span id='10'>With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take</span><br/>
<span id='12'>More composition and fierce quality</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund</span><br/>
<span id='18'>As to the legitimate: fine word,&mdash;legitimate!</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And my invention thrive, Edmund the base</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Now, gods, stand up for bastards!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter GLOUCESTER</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And the king gone to-night! subscribed his power!</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Confined to exhibition! All this done</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Upon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>So please your lordship, none.</span><br/>
<p><em>Putting up the letter</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>I know no news, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>What paper were you reading?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Nothing, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of</span><br/>
<span id='33'>it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath</span><br/>
<span id='34'>not such need to hide itself. Let's see: come,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter</span><br/>
<span id='37'>from my brother, that I have not all o'er-read;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>and for so much as I have perused, I find it not</span><br/>
<span id='39'>fit for your o'er-looking.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Give me the letter, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The</span><br/>
<span id='42'>contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Let's see, let's see.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote</span><br/>
<span id='45'>this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>[Reads]  'This policy and reverence of age makes</span><br/>
<span id='47'>the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps</span><br/>
<span id='48'>our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish</span><br/>
<span id='49'>them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage</span><br/>
<span id='50'>in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, not</span><br/>
<span id='51'>as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to</span><br/>
<span id='52'>me, that of this I may speak more. If our father</span><br/>
<span id='53'>would sleep till I waked him, you should half his</span><br/>
<span id='54'>revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your</span><br/>
<span id='55'>brother,	EDGAR.'</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Hum&mdash;conspiracy!&mdash;'Sleep till I waked him,&mdash;you</span><br/>
<span id='57'>should enjoy half his revenue,'&mdash;My son Edgar!</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain</span><br/>
<span id='59'>to breed it in?&mdash;When came this to you? who</span><br/>
<span id='60'>brought it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>It was not brought me, my lord; there's the</span><br/>
<span id='62'>cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the</span><br/>
<span id='63'>casement of my closet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>You know the character to be your brother's?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear</span><br/>
<span id='66'>it were his; but, in respect of that, I would</span><br/>
<span id='67'>fain think it were not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>It is his.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is</span><br/>
<span id='70'>not in the contents.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft</span><br/>
<span id='73'>maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>and fathers declining, the father should be as</span><br/>
<span id='75'>ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>O villain, villain! His very opinion in the</span><br/>
<span id='77'>letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>seek him; I'll apprehend him: abominable villain!</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Where is he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please</span><br/>
<span id='82'>you to suspend your indignation against my</span><br/>
<span id='83'>brother till you can derive from him better</span><br/>
<span id='84'>testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain</span><br/>
<span id='85'>course; where, if you violently proceed against</span><br/>
<span id='86'>him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great</span><br/>
<span id='87'>gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the</span><br/>
<span id='88'>heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life</span><br/>
<span id='89'>for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my</span><br/>
<span id='90'>affection to your honour, and to no further</span><br/>
<span id='91'>pretence of danger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Think you so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>If your honour judge it meet, I will place you</span><br/>
<span id='94'>where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an</span><br/>
<span id='95'>auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and</span><br/>
<span id='96'>that without any further delay than this very evening.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>He cannot be such a monster&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Nor is not, sure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>To his father, that so tenderly and entirely</span><br/>
<span id='100'>loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him</span><br/>
<span id='101'>out: wind me into him, I pray you: frame the</span><br/>
<span id='102'>business after your own wisdom. I would unstate</span><br/>
<span id='103'>myself, to be in a due resolution.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>I will seek him, sir, presently: convey the</span><br/>
<span id='105'>business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend</span><br/>
<span id='107'>no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can</span><br/>
<span id='108'>reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself</span><br/>
<span id='109'>scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>friendship falls off, brothers divide: in</span><br/>
<span id='111'>cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in</span><br/>
<span id='112'>palaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt son</span><br/>
<span id='113'>and father. This villain of mine comes under the</span><br/>
<span id='114'>prediction; there's son against father: the king</span><br/>
<span id='115'>falls from bias of nature; there's father against</span><br/>
<span id='116'>child. We have seen the best of our time:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all</span><br/>
<span id='118'>ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our</span><br/>
<span id='119'>graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall</span><br/>
<span id='120'>lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the</span><br/>
<span id='121'>noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his</span><br/>
<span id='122'>offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>when we are sick in fortune,&mdash;often the surfeit</span><br/>
<span id='125'>of our own behavior,&mdash;we make guilty of our</span><br/>
<span id='126'>disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as</span><br/>
<span id='127'>if we were villains by necessity; fools by</span><br/>
<span id='128'>heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and</span><br/>
<span id='129'>treachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of</span><br/>
<span id='131'>planetary influence; and all that we are evil in,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion</span><br/>
<span id='133'>of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish</span><br/>
<span id='134'>disposition to the charge of a star! My</span><br/>
<span id='135'>father compounded with my mother under the</span><br/>
<span id='136'>dragon's tail; and my nativity was under Ursa</span><br/>
<span id='137'>major; so that it follows, I am rough and</span><br/>
<span id='138'>lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>had the maidenliest star in the firmament</span><br/>
<span id='140'>twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter EDGAR</em></p>
<span id='141'>And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old</span><br/>
<span id='142'>comedy: my cue is villanous melancholy, with a</span><br/>
<span id='143'>sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses do</span><br/>
<span id='144'>portend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>How now, brother Edmund! what serious</span><br/>
<span id='146'>contemplation are you in?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read</span><br/>
<span id='148'>this other day, what should follow these eclipses.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>

<span id='149'>Do you busy yourself about that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed</span><br/>
<span id='151'>unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child</span><br/>
<span id='152'>and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of</span><br/>
<span id='153'>ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and</span><br/>
<span id='154'>maledictions against king and nobles; needless</span><br/>
<span id='155'>diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation</span><br/>
<span id='156'>of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>How long have you been a sectary astronomical?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>

<span id='158'>Come, come; when saw you my father last?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Why, the night gone by.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Spake you with him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>Ay, two hours together.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Parted you in good terms? Found you no</span><br/>
<span id='163'>displeasure in him by word or countenance?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>None at all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended</span><br/>
<span id='166'>him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence</span><br/>
<span id='167'>till some little time hath qualified the heat of</span><br/>
<span id='168'>his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth</span><br/>
<span id='169'>in him, that with the mischief of your person it</span><br/>
<span id='170'>would scarcely allay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Some villain hath done me wrong.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>That's my fear. I pray you, have a continent</span><br/>
<span id='173'>forbearance till the speed of his rage goes</span><br/>
<span id='174'>slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my</span><br/>
<span id='175'>lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to</span><br/>
<span id='176'>hear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there's my key:</span><br/>
<span id='177'>if you do stir abroad, go armed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>Armed, brother!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>EDMUND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed: I</span><br/>
<span id='180'>am no honest man if there be any good meaning</span><br/>
<span id='181'>towards you: I have told you what I have seen</span><br/>
<span id='182'>and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image</span><br/>
<span id='183'>and horror of it: pray you, away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>

<span id='184'>Shall I hear from you anon?</span><br/>

<p><em>Exit EDGAR</em></p>
<span id='186'>A credulous father! and a brother noble,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Whose nature is so far from doing harms,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>That he suspects none: on whose foolish honesty</span><br/>
<span id='189'>My practises ride easy! I see the business.</span><br/>

<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, DOUGLAS, and VERNON</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>We'll fight with him to-night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>It may not be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>EARL OF DOUGLAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>You give him then the advantage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>VERNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Not a whit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Why say you so? looks he not for supply?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>VERNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>So do we.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>        His is certain, ours is doubtful.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Good cousin, be advised; stir not tonight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>VERNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Do not, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>EARL OF DOUGLAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>                  You do not counsel well:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>You speak it out of fear and cold heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>VERNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And I dare well maintain it with my life,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>If well-respected honour bid me on,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>I hold as little counsel with weak fear</span><br/>
<span id='16'>As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Which of us fears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>EARL OF DOUGLAS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>                  Yea, or to-night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>VERNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Content.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>To-night, say I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>VERNON</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Come, come it may not be. I wonder much,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Being men of such great leading as you are,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>That you foresee not what impediments</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Drag back our expedition: certain horse</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And now their pride and mettle is asleep,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>That not a horse is half the half of himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>So are the horses of the enemy</span><br/>
<span id='32'>In general, journey-bated and brought low:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>The better part of ours are full of rest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>EARL OF WORCESTER</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>The number of the king exceedeth ours:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>For God's sake, cousin, stay till all come in.</span><br/>
<p><em>The trumpet sounds a parley</em></p>
<p><em>Enter SIR WALTER BLUNT</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SIR WALTER BLUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>I come with gracious offers from the king,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God</span><br/>
<span id='39'>You were of our determination!</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Some of us love you well; and even those some</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Envy your great deservings and good name,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Because you are not of our quality,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>But stand against us like an enemy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SIR WALTER BLUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>And God defend but still I should stand so,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>So long as out of limit and true rule</span><br/>
<span id='46'>You stand against anointed majesty.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>But to my charge. The king hath sent to know</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The nature of your griefs, and whereupon</span><br/>
<span id='49'>You conjure from the breast of civil peace</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Audacious cruelty. If that the king</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Have any way your good deserts forgot,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Which he confesseth to be manifold,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed</span><br/>
<span id='55'>You shall have your desires with interest</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And pardon absolute for yourself and these</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Herein misled by your suggestion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>The king is kind; and well we know the king</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>My father and my uncle and myself</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Did give him that same royalty he wears;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And when he was not six and twenty strong,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>My father gave him welcome to the shore;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And when he heard him swear and vow to God</span><br/>
<span id='67'>He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>To sue his livery and beg his peace,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>My father, in kind heart and pity moved,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Now when the lords and barons of the realm</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>The more and less came in with cap and knee;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Even at the heels in golden multitudes.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>He presently, as greatness knows itself,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Steps me a little higher than his vow</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Made to my father, while his blood was poor,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Some certain edicts and some strait decrees</span><br/>
<span id='86'>That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>This seeming brow of justice, did he win</span><br/>
<span id='90'>The hearts of all that he did angle for;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Proceeded further; cut me off the heads</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Of all the favourites that the absent king</span><br/>
<span id='93'>In deputation left behind him here,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>When he was personal in the Irish war.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SIR WALTER BLUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Tut, I came not to hear this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Then to the point.</span><br/>
<span id='97'>In short time after, he deposed the king;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Soon after that, deprived him of his life;</span><br/>
<span id='99'>And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Who is, if every owner were well placed,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>There without ransom to lie forfeited;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Disgraced me in my happy victories,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Sought to entrap me by intelligence;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Rated mine uncle from the council-board;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And in conclusion drove us to seek out</span><br/>
<span id='110'>This head of safety; and withal to pry</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Into his title, the which we find</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Too indirect for long continuance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>SIR WALTER BLUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Shall I return this answer to the king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Some surety for a safe return again,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And in the morning early shall my uncle</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>SIR WALTER BLUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>I would you would accept of grace and love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HOTSPUR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>And may be so we shall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>SIR WALTER BLUNT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Pray God you do.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

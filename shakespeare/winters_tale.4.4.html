<h1>Winter's Tale</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>The Shepherd's cottage.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>FLORIZEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>These your unusual weeds to each part of you</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Is as a meeting of the petty gods,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And you the queen on't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PERDITA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Sir, my gracious lord,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured</span><br/>
<span id='10'>With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts</span><br/>
<span id='12'>In every mess have folly and the feeders</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Digest it with a custom, I should blush</span><br/>
<span id='14'>To see you so attired, sworn, I think,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>To show myself a glass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>FLORIZEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>I bless the time</span><br/>
<span id='17'>When my good falcon made her flight across</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Thy father's ground.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PERDITA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Now Jove afford you cause!</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To me the difference forges dread; your greatness</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble</span><br/>
<span id='22'>To think your father, by some accident,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!</span><br/>
<span id='24'>How would he look, to see his work so noble</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold</span><br/>
<span id='27'>The sternness of his presence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>FLORIZEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Apprehend</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Humbling their deities to love, have taken</span><br/>
<span id='31'>The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune</span><br/>
<span id='33'>A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>As I seem now. Their transformations</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Burn hotter than my faith.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PERDITA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>O, but, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>One of these two must be necessities,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Which then will speak, that you must</span><br/>
<span id='45'>change this purpose,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Or I my life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>FLORIZEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>                  Thou dearest Perdita,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not</span><br/>
<span id='49'>The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Or not my father's. For I cannot be</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Mine own, nor any thing to any, if</span><br/>
<span id='52'>I be not thine. To this I am most constant,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing</span><br/>
<span id='55'>That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Lift up your countenance, as it were the day</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Of celebration of that nuptial which</span><br/>
<span id='58'>We two have sworn shall come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PERDITA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>O lady Fortune,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Stand you auspicious!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>FLORIZEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>See, your guests approach:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And let's be red with mirth.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Shepherd, Clown, MOPSA, DORCAS, and others, with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon</span><br/>
<span id='65'>This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire</span><br/>
<span id='70'>With labour and the thing she took to quench it,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>She would to each one sip. You are retired,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>As if you were a feasted one and not</span><br/>
<span id='73'>The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid</span><br/>
<span id='74'>These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is</span><br/>
<span id='75'>A way to make us better friends, more known.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Come, quench your blushes and present yourself</span><br/>
<span id='77'>That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>As your good flock shall prosper.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PERDITA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>[To POLIXENES]                  Sir, welcome:</span><br/>
<span id='81'>It is my father's will I should take on me</span><br/>
<span id='82'>The hostess-ship o' the day.</span><br/>
<p><em>To CAMILLO</em></p>
<span id='83'>You're welcome, sir.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Seeming and savour all the winter long:</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Grace and remembrance be to you both,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And welcome to our shearing!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Shepherdess,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>A fair one are you&mdash;well you fit our ages</span><br/>
<span id='91'>With flowers of winter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PERDITA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Sir, the year growing ancient,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Of trembling winter, the fairest</span><br/>
<span id='95'>flowers o' the season</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not</span><br/>
<span id='99'>To get slips of them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Wherefore, gentle maiden,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Do you neglect them?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PERDITA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>For I have heard it said</span><br/>
<span id='103'>There is an art which in their piedness shares</span><br/>
<span id='104'>With great creating nature.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Say there be;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Yet nature is made better by no mean</span><br/>
<span id='107'>But nature makes that mean: so, over that art</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Which you say adds to nature, is an art</span><br/>
<span id='109'>That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry</span><br/>
<span id='110'>A gentler scion to the wildest stock,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And make conceive a bark of baser kind</span><br/>
<span id='112'>By bud of nobler race: this is an art</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Which does mend nature, change it rather, but</span><br/>
<span id='114'>The art itself is nature.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PERDITA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>So it is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And do not call them bastards.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PERDITA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>I'll not put</span><br/>
<span id='119'>The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;</span><br/>
<span id='120'>No more than were I painted I would wish</span><br/>
<span id='121'>This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And with him rises weeping: these are flowers</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Of middle summer, and I think they are given</span><br/>
<span id='127'>To men of middle age. You're very welcome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>CAMILLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And only live by gazing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PERDITA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Out, alas!</span><br/>
<span id='131'>You'd be so lean, that blasts of January</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Would blow you through and through.</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Now, my fair'st friend,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>That wear upon your virgin branches yet</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall</span><br/>
<span id='139'>From Dis's waggon! daffodils,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>That come before the swallow dares, and take</span><br/>
<span id='141'>The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses</span><br/>
<span id='144'>That die unmarried, ere they can behold</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Bight Phoebus in his strength&mdash;a malady</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and</span><br/>
<span id='147'>The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>To strew him o'er and o'er!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>FLORIZEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>What, like a corse?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PERDITA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Methinks I play as I have seen them do</span><br/>
<span id='156'>In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Does change my disposition.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>FLORIZEL</strong></span>

<span id='158'>What you do</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you</span><br/>
<span id='164'>A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do</span><br/>
<span id='165'>Nothing but that; move still, still so,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And own no other function: each your doing,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>So singular in each particular,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>That all your acts are queens.</span><br/>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PERDITA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>O Doricles,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Your praises are too large: but that your youth,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>You woo'd me the false way.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>FLORIZEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>I think you have</span><br/>
<span id='177'>As little skill to fear as I have purpose</span><br/>
<span id='178'>To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>That never mean to part.</span><br/>

<span id='speech28'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems</span><br/>
<span id='184'>But smacks of something greater than herself,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Too noble for this place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CAMILLO</strong></span>

<span id='186'>He tells her something</span><br/>
<span id='187'>That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is</span><br/>
<span id='188'>The queen of curds and cream.</span><br/>

<span id='196'>Which dances with your daughter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>They call him Doricles; and boasts himself</span><br/>
<span id='198'>To have a worthy feeding: but I have it</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Upon his own report and I believe it;</span><br/>
<span id='200'>He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:</span><br/>
<span id='201'>I think so too; for never gazed the moon</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Upon the water as he'll stand and read</span><br/>
<span id='203'>As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain,</span><br/>

</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Shepherd</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='207'>So she does any thing; though I report it,</span><br/>

<span id='213'>pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings</span><br/>
<span id='214'>several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he</span><br/>
<span id='215'>utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's</span><br/>
<span id='216'>ears grew to his tunes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>He could never come better; he shall come in. I</span><br/>

<span id='speech40'><strong>Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='221'>He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no</span><br/>

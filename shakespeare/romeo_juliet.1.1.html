<h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I.</h3>
<h4>Verona. A public place.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GREGORY</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>No, for then we should be colliers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GREGORY</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>I strike quickly, being moved.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GREGORY</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>GREGORY</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will</span><br/>
<span id='11'>take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>GREGORY</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes</span><br/>
<span id='13'>to the wall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids</span><br/>
<span id='17'>to the wall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GREGORY</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I</span><br/>
<span id='20'>have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the</span><br/>
<span id='21'>maids, and cut off their heads.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>GREGORY</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>The heads of the maids?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>take it in what sense thou wilt.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GREGORY</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>They must take it in sense that feel it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and</span><br/>
<span id='27'>'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GREGORY</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou</span><br/>
<span id='29'>hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes</span><br/>
<span id='30'>two of the house of the Montagues.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>GREGORY</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>How! turn thy back and run?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Fear me not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>GREGORY</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>No, marry; I fear thee!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>GREGORY</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as</span><br/>
<span id='37'>they list.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ABRAHAM</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>I do bite my thumb, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>ABRAHAM</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>[Aside to GREGORY]  Is the law of our side, if I say</span><br/>
<span id='44'>ay?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>GREGORY</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>No.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I</span><br/>
<span id='47'>bite my thumb, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>GREGORY</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Do you quarrel, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>ABRAHAM</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Quarrel sir! no, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>ABRAHAM</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>No better.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Well, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>GREGORY</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Yes, better, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>ABRAHAM</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>You lie.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>SAMPSON</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.</span><br/>
<p><em>They fight</em></p>
<p><em>Enter BENVOLIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Part, fools!</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Put up your swords; you know not what you do.</span><br/>
<p><em>Beats down their swords</em></p>
<p><em>Enter TYBALT</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>TYBALT</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Or manage it to part these men with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>TYBALT</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Have at thee, coward!</span><br/>
<p><em>They fight</em></p>
<p><em>Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>First Citizen</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And flourishes his blade in spite of me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>LADY MONTAGUE</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PRINCE, with Attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>PRINCE</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>That quench the fire of your pernicious rage</span><br/>
<span id='78'>With purple fountains issuing from your veins,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And hear the sentence of your moved prince.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>And made Verona's ancient citizens</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>To wield old partisans, in hands as old,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:</span><br/>
<span id='89'>If ever you disturb our streets again,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>For this time, all the rest depart away:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>You Capulet; shall go along with me:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And, Montague, come you this afternoon,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>To know our further pleasure in this case,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Here were the servants of your adversary,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>I drew to part them: in the instant came</span><br/>
<span id='102'>The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>He swung about his head and cut the winds,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:</span><br/>
<span id='106'>While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Came more and more and fought on part and part,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Till the prince came, who parted either part.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>LADY MONTAGUE</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Where, underneath the grove of sycamore</span><br/>
<span id='115'>That westward rooteth from the city's side,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>So early walking did I see your son:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Towards him I made, but he was ware of me</span><br/>
<span id='118'>And stole into the covert of the wood:</span><br/>
<span id='119'>I, measuring his affections by my own,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>That most are busied when they're most alone,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Pursued my humour not pursuing his,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Many a morning hath he there been seen,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;</span><br/>
<span id='126'>But all so soon as the all-cheering sun</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Should in the furthest east begin to draw</span><br/>
<span id='128'>The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Away from the light steals home my heavy son,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>And private in his chamber pens himself,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out</span><br/>
<span id='132'>And makes himself an artificial night:</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Black and portentous must this humour prove,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>I neither know it nor can learn of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Have you importuned him by any means?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Both by myself and many other friends:</span><br/>
<span id='139'>But he, his own affections' counsellor,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Is to himself--I will not say how true--</span><br/>
<span id='141'>But to himself so secret and so close,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>So far from sounding and discovery,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>As is the bud bit with an envious worm,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.</span><br/>
<span id='147'>We would as willingly give cure as know.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ROMEO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;</span><br/>
<span id='149'>I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>MONTAGUE</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Good-morrow, cousin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Is the day so young?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>But new struck nine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>Ay me! sad hours seem long.</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Was that my father that went hence so fast?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>Not having that, which, having, makes them short.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>In love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>Out--</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>Of love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Out of her favour, where I am in love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!</span><br/>
<span id='171'>O any thing, of nothing first create!</span><br/>
<span id='172'>O heavy lightness! serious vanity!</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>sick health!</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!</span><br/>
<span id='177'>This love feel I, that feel no love in this.</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Dost thou not laugh?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>No, coz, I rather weep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Good heart, at what?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>At thy good heart's oppression.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>Why, such is love's transgression.</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest</span><br/>
<span id='185'>With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:</span><br/>
<span id='190'>What is it else? a madness most discreet,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>A choking gall and a preserving sweet.</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Farewell, my coz.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>                  Soft! I will go along;</span><br/>
<span id='194'>An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;</span><br/>
<span id='196'>This is not Romeo, he's some other where.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>What, shall I groan and tell thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>Groan! why, no.</span><br/>
<span id='200'>But sadly tell me who.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!</span><br/>
<span id='203'>In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='207'>Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit</span><br/>
<span id='208'>With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;</span><br/>
<span id='209'>And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,</span><br/>
<span id='210'>From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.</span><br/>
<span id='211'>She will not stay the siege of loving terms,</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:</span><br/>
<span id='214'>O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>That when she dies with beauty dies her store.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech89'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech90'><strong>ROMEO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='217'>She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,</span><br/>
<span id='218'>For beauty starved with her severity</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Cuts beauty off from all posterity.</span><br/>
<span id='220'>She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,</span><br/>
<span id='221'>To merit bliss by making me despair:</span><br/>
<span id='222'>She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow</span><br/>
<span id='223'>Do I live dead that live to tell it now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech91'><strong>BENVOLIO</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='224'>Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<span id='228'>'Tis the way</span><br/>
<span id='229'>To call hers exquisite, in question more:</span><br/>
<span id='230'>These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;</span><br/>
<span id='232'>He that is strucken blind cannot forget</span><br/>
<span id='233'>The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:</span><br/>
<span id='234'>Show me a mistress that is passing fair,</span><br/>
<span id='235'>What doth her beauty serve, but as a note</span><br/>
<span id='236'>Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?</span><br/>
<span id='237'>Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.</span><br/>

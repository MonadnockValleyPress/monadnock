<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene VI</h3>
<h4>Camp before Florence.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter BERTRAM and the two French Lords</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his</span><br/>
<span id='2'>way.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no</span><br/>
<span id='4'>more in your respect.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>On my life, my lord, a bubble.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Do you think I am so far deceived in him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>without any malice, but to speak of him as my</span><br/>
<span id='9'>kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and</span><br/>
<span id='10'>endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner</span><br/>
<span id='11'>of no one good quality worthy your lordship's</span><br/>
<span id='12'>entertainment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in</span><br/>
<span id='14'>his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some</span><br/>
<span id='15'>great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>I would I knew in what particular action to try him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>None better than to let him fetch off his drum,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly</span><br/>
<span id='20'>surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he</span><br/>
<span id='21'>knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink</span><br/>
<span id='22'>him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he</span><br/>
<span id='23'>is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when</span><br/>
<span id='24'>we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship</span><br/>
<span id='25'>present at his examination: if he do not, for the</span><br/>
<span id='26'>promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of</span><br/>
<span id='27'>base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the</span><br/>
<span id='28'>intelligence in his power against you, and that with</span><br/>
<span id='29'>the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never</span><br/>
<span id='30'>trust my judgment in any thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>he says he has a stratagem for't: when your</span><br/>
<span id='33'>lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to</span><br/>
<span id='34'>what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be</span><br/>
<span id='35'>melted, if you give him not John Drum's</span><br/>
<span id='36'>entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Here he comes.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PAROLLES</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>[Aside to BERTRAM]  O, for the love of laughter,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch</span><br/>
<span id='40'>off his drum in any hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your</span><br/>
<span id='42'>disposition.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!</span><br/>
<span id='45'>There was excellent command,&mdash;to charge in with our</span><br/>
<span id='46'>horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>That was not to be blamed in the command of the</span><br/>
<span id='48'>service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar</span><br/>
<span id='49'>himself could not have prevented, if he had been</span><br/>
<span id='50'>there to command.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some</span><br/>
<span id='52'>dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is</span><br/>
<span id='53'>not to be recovered.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>It might have been recovered.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>It might; but it is not now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>It is to be recovered: but that the merit of</span><br/>
<span id='57'>service is seldom attributed to the true and exact</span><br/>
<span id='58'>performer, I would have that drum or another, or</span><br/>
<span id='59'>'hic jacet.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you</span><br/>
<span id='61'>think your mystery in stratagem can bring this</span><br/>
<span id='62'>instrument of honour again into his native quarter,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will</span><br/>
<span id='64'>grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you</span><br/>
<span id='65'>speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>and extend to you what further becomes his</span><br/>
<span id='67'>greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your</span><br/>
<span id='68'>worthiness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>But you must not now slumber in it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>I'll about it this evening: and I will presently</span><br/>
<span id='72'>pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my</span><br/>
<span id='73'>certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>and by midnight look to hear further from me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>I know not what the success will be, my lord; but</span><br/>
<span id='77'>the attempt I vow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>I know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of</span><br/>
<span id='79'>thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PAROLLES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>I love not many words.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a</span><br/>
<span id='82'>strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems</span><br/>
<span id='83'>to undertake this business, which he knows is not to</span><br/>
<span id='84'>be done; damns himself to do and dares better be</span><br/>
<span id='85'>damned than to do't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it</span><br/>
<span id='87'>is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and</span><br/>
<span id='88'>for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but</span><br/>
<span id='89'>when you find him out, you have him ever after.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of</span><br/>
<span id='91'>this that so seriously he does address himself unto?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>None in the world; but return with an invention and</span><br/>
<span id='93'>clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we</span><br/>
<span id='94'>have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall</span><br/>
<span id='95'>to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case</span><br/>
<span id='97'>him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a</span><br/>
<span id='99'>sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this</span><br/>
<span id='100'>very night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Your brother he shall go along with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>Second Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Now will I lead you to the house, and show you</span><br/>
<span id='105'>The lass I spoke of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>But you say she's honest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>BERTRAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Tokens and letters which she did re-send;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Will you go see her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>First Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>With all my heart, my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

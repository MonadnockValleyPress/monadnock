<h1>Richard II</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Westminster Hall.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter, as to the Parliament, HENRY BOLINGBROKE,  DUKE OF AUMERLE, NORTHUMBERLAND, HENRY PERCY, LORD  FITZWATER, DUKE OF SURREY, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE,  the Abbot Of Westminster, and another Lord, Herald, Officers, and BAGOT</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Call forth Bagot.</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd</span><br/>
<span id='5'>The bloody office of his timeless end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BAGOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BAGOT</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>That reacheth from the restful English court</span><br/>
<span id='13'>As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Amongst much other talk, that very time,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>I heard you say that you had rather refuse</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The offer of an hundred thousand crowns</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Than Bolingbroke's return to England;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Adding withal how blest this land would be</span><br/>
<span id='19'>In this your cousin's death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Princes and noble lords,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>What answer shall I make to this base man?</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>On equal terms to give him chastisement?</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd</span><br/>
<span id='25'>With the attainder of his slanderous lips.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>There is my gage, the manual seal of death,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And will maintain what thou hast said is false</span><br/>
<span id='29'>In thy heart-blood, though being all too base</span><br/>
<span id='30'>To stain the temper of my knightly sword.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Excepting one, I would he were the best</span><br/>
<span id='33'>In all this presence that hath moved me so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LORD FITZWATER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>If that thy valour stand on sympathy,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it</span><br/>
<span id='38'>That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Where it was forged, with my rapier's point.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LORD FITZWATER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>HENRY PERCY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true</span><br/>
<span id='46'>In this appeal as thou art all unjust;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>To prove it on thee to the extremest point</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>An if I do not, may my hands rot off</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And never brandish more revengeful steel</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Over the glittering helmet of my foe!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Lord</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And spur thee on with full as many lies</span><br/>
<span id='55'>As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear</span><br/>
<span id='56'>From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>I have a thousand spirits in one breast,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>To answer twenty thousand such as you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DUKE OF SURREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well</span><br/>
<span id='62'>The very time Aumerle and you did talk.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>LORD FITZWATER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>'Tis very true: you were in presence then;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And you can witness with me this is true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DUKE OF SURREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LORD FITZWATER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Surrey, thou liest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DUKE OF SURREY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Dishonourable boy!</span><br/>
<span id='68'>That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>That it shall render vengeance and revenge</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie</span><br/>
<span id='71'>In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LORD FITZWATER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!</span><br/>
<span id='75'>If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>To tie thee to my strong correction.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>As I intend to thrive in this new world,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say</span><br/>
<span id='83'>That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men</span><br/>
<span id='84'>To execute the noble duke at Calais.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Some honest Christian trust me with a gage</span><br/>
<span id='86'>That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>These differences shall all rest under gage</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And, though mine enemy, restored again</span><br/>
<span id='91'>To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BISHOP OF CARLISLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought</span><br/>
<span id='95'>For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And toil'd with works of war, retired himself</span><br/>
<span id='99'>To Italy; and there at Venice gave</span><br/>
<span id='100'>His body to that pleasant country's earth,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Under whose colours he had fought so long.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BISHOP OF CARLISLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>As surely as I live, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Your differences shall all rest under gage</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Till we assign you to your days of trial.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DUKE OF YORK, attended</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee</span><br/>
<span id='110'>From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields</span><br/>
<span id='112'>To the possession of thy royal hand:</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Ascend his throne, descending now from him;</span><br/>
<span id='114'>And long live Henry, fourth of that name!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>BISHOP OF CARLISLE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Marry. God forbid!</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Worst in this royal presence may I speak,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Would God that any in this noble presence</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Were enough noble to be upright judge</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.</span><br/>
<span id='123'>What subject can give sentence on his king?</span><br/>
<span id='124'>And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Although apparent guilt be seen in them;</span><br/>
<span id='127'>And shall the figure of God's majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>His captain, steward, deputy-elect,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Anointed, crowned, planted many years,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Be judged by subject and inferior breath,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>That in a Christian climate souls refined</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!</span><br/>
<span id='134'>I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:</span><br/>
<span id='136'>My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>And if you crown him, let me prophesy:</span><br/>
<span id='139'>The blood of English shall manure the ground,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>And future ages groan for this foul act;</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd</span><br/>
<span id='146'>The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.</span><br/>
<span id='147'>O, if you raise this house against this house,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>It will the woefullest division prove</span><br/>
<span id='149'>That ever fell upon this cursed earth.</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!</span><br/>

<span id='speech31'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></span>

<span id='152'>Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Of capital treason we arrest you here.</span><br/>
<span id='154'>My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge</span><br/>
<span id='155'>To keep him safely till his day of trial.</span><br/>
<span id='156'>May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.</span><br/>

<span id='157'>Fetch hither Richard, that in common view</span><br/>
<span id='158'>He may surrender; so we shall proceed</span><br/>

<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>Lords, you that here are under our arrest,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Procure your sureties for your days of answer.</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Little are we beholding to your love,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>And little look'd for at your helping hands.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter DUKE OF YORK, with KING RICHARD II, and Officers bearing the regalia</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>Alack, why am I sent for to a king,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Before I have shook off the regal thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd</span><br/>
<span id='168'>To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me</span><br/>
<span id='170'>To this submission. Yet I well remember</span><br/>
<span id='171'>The favours of these men: were they not mine?</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?</span><br/>
<span id='173'>So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Found truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none.</span><br/>
<span id='175'>God save the king! Will no man say amen?</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.</span><br/>
<span id='177'>God save the king! although I be not he;</span><br/>
<span id='178'>And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.</span><br/>
<span id='179'>To do what service am I sent for hither?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>To do that office of thine own good will</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Which tired majesty did make thee offer,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>The resignation of thy state and crown</span><br/>
<span id='183'>To Henry Bolingbroke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;</span><br/>
<span id='185'>Here cousin:</span><br/>
<span id='186'>On this side my hand, and on that side yours.</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Now is this golden crown like a deep well</span><br/>
<span id='188'>That owes two buckets, filling one another,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>The emptier ever dancing in the air,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>The other down, unseen and full of water:</span><br/>
<span id='191'>That bucket down and full of tears am I,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='193'>I thought you had been willing to resign.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='194'>My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:</span><br/>
<span id='195'>You may my glories and my state depose,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>But not my griefs; still am I king of those.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>Part of your cares you give me with your crown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.</span><br/>
<span id='199'>My care is loss of care, by old care done;</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Your care is gain of care, by new care won:</span><br/>
<span id='201'>The cares I give I have, though given away;</span><br/>
<span id='202'>They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='203'>Are you contented to resign the crown?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='204'>Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.</span><br/>
<span id='206'>Now mark me, how I will undo myself;</span><br/>
<span id='207'>I give this heavy weight from off my head</span><br/>
<span id='208'>And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;</span><br/>
<span id='210'>With mine own tears I wash away my balm,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>With mine own hands I give away my crown,</span><br/>
<span id='212'>With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>With mine own breath release all duty's rites:</span><br/>
<span id='214'>All pomp and majesty I do forswear;</span><br/>
<span id='215'>My manors, rents, revenues I forego;</span><br/>
<span id='216'>My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:</span><br/>
<span id='217'>God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!</span><br/>
<span id='218'>God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,</span><br/>
<span id='220'>And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!</span><br/>
<span id='221'>Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,</span><br/>
<span id='222'>And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!</span><br/>
<span id='223'>God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,</span><br/>
<span id='224'>And send him many years of sunshine days!</span><br/>
<span id='225'>What more remains?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='226'>                  No more, but that you read</span><br/>

<span id='251'>Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,</span><br/>

<span id='276'>The commons will not then be satisfied.</span><br/>

<span id='speech55'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='277'>They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,</span><br/>
<span id='278'>When I do see the very book indeed</span><br/>
<span id='279'>Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Attendant, with a glass</em></p>
<span id='280'>Give me the glass, and therein will I read.</span><br/>
<span id='281'>No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck</span><br/>
<span id='282'>So many blows upon this face of mine,</span><br/>
<span id='283'>And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,</span><br/>
<span id='284'>Like to my followers in prosperity,</span><br/>
<span id='285'>Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face</span><br/>
<span id='286'>That every day under his household roof</span><br/>
<span id='287'>Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face</span><br/>
<span id='288'>That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?</span><br/>
<span id='289'>Was this the face that faced so many follies,</span><br/>
<span id='290'>And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?</span><br/>
<span id='291'>A brittle glory shineth in this face:</span><br/>
<span id='292'>As brittle as the glory is the face;</span><br/>
<p><em>Dashes the glass against the ground</em></p>
<span id='293'>For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers.</span><br/>
<span id='294'>Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,</span><br/>
<span id='295'>How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.</span><br/>

<span id='speech57'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='298'>Say that again.</span><br/>
<span id='299'>The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:</span><br/>
<span id='300'>'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;</span><br/>
<span id='301'>And these external manners of laments</span><br/>
<span id='302'>Are merely shadows to the unseen grief</span><br/>
<span id='303'>That swells with silence in the tortured soul;</span><br/>
<span id='304'>There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,</span><br/>
<span id='305'>For thy great bounty, that not only givest</span><br/>
<span id='306'>Me cause to wail but teachest me the way</span><br/>
<span id='307'>How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,</span><br/>
<span id='308'>And then be gone and trouble you no more.</span><br/>
<span id='309'>Shall I obtain it?</span><br/>

<span id='speech59'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='311'>'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:</span><br/>
<span id='312'>For when I was a king, my flatterers</span><br/>
<span id='313'>Were then but subjects; being now a subject,</span><br/>
<span id='314'>I have a king here to my flatterer.</span><br/>
<span id='315'>Being so great, I have no need to beg.</span><br/>

<span id='speech63'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>

<span id='322'>Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.</span><br/>

<span id='speech67'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>

<span id='323'>O, good! convey? conveyers are you all,</span><br/>
<span id='324'>That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt KING RICHARD II, some Lords, and a Guard</em></p>

<span id='325'>On Wednesday next we solemnly set down</span><br/>
<span id='326'>Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all except the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the Abbot of Westminster, and DUKE OF AUMERLE</em></p>

<span id='speech70'><strong>BISHOP OF CARLISLE</strong></span>

<span id='328'>The woe's to come; the children yet unborn</span><br/>

<span id='333'>Before I freely speak my mind herein,</span><br/>
<span id='334'>You shall not only take the sacrament</span><br/>
<span id='335'>To bury mine intents, but also to effect</span><br/>
<span id='336'>Whatever I shall happen to devise.</span><br/>
<span id='337'>I see your brows are full of discontent,</span><br/>
<span id='338'>Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:</span><br/>
<span id='339'>Come home with me to supper; and I'll lay</span><br/>
<span id='340'>A plot shall show us all a merry day.</span><br/>

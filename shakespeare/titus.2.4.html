<h1>Titus Andronicus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Another part of the forest.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON with LAVINIA, ravished; her hands cut off, and her tongue cut out</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>See, how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And so let's leave her to her silent walks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CHIRON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>An 'twere my case, I should go hang myself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DEMETRIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON</em></p>
<p><em>Enter MARCUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>MARCUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Who is this? my niece, that flies away so fast!</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Cousin, a word; where is your husband?</span><br/>
<span id='13'>If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!</span><br/>
<span id='14'>If I do wake, some planet strike me down,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>That I may slumber in eternal sleep!</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And might not gain so great a happiness</span><br/>
<span id='21'>As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Coming and going with thy honey breath.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?</span><br/>
<span id='34'>O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>That could have better sew'd than Philomel.</span><br/>
<span id='44'>O, had the monster seen those lily hands</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>He would not then have touch'd them for his life!</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Which that sweet tongue hath made,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep</span><br/>
<span id='51'>As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>For such a sight will blind a father's eye:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee</span><br/>
<span id='57'>O, could our mourning ease thy misery!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

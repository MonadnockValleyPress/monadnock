<h1>Henry VI, Part 3</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Another part of the field.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Alarum. Enter YORK</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>The army of the queen hath got the field:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>And all my followers to the eager foe</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>But this I know, they have demean'd themselves</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Like men born to renown by life or death.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Three times did Richard make a lane to me.</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!'</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And full as oft came Edward to my side,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>With purple falchion, painted to the hilt</span><br/>
<span id='13'>In blood of those that had encounter'd him:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And when the hardiest warriors did retire,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!'</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!</span><br/>
<span id='17'>A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'</span><br/>
<span id='18'>With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!</span><br/>
<span id='19'>We bodged again; as I have seen a swan</span><br/>
<span id='20'>With bootless labour swim against the tide</span><br/>
<span id='21'>And spend her strength with over-matching waves.</span><br/>
<p><em>A short alarum within</em></p>
<span id='22'>Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And I am faint and cannot fly their fury:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And were I strong, I would not shun their fury:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The sands are number'd that make up my life;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Here must I stay, and here my life must end.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter QUEEN MARGARET, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND, PRINCE EDWARD, and Soldiers</em></p>
<span id='27'>Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>I am your butt, and I abide your shot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>With downright payment, show'd unto my father.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And made an evening at the noontide prick.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth</span><br/>
<span id='36'>A bird that will revenge upon you all:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>So cowards fight when they can fly no further;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And in thy thought o'er-run my former time;</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And, if though canst for blushing, view this face,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>I will not bandy with thee word for word,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes</span><br/>
<span id='52'>I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much</span><br/>
<span id='55'>To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>When he might spurn him with his foot away?</span><br/>
<span id='59'>It is war's prize to take all vantages;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>And ten to one is no impeach of valour.</span><br/>
<p><em>They lay hands on YORK, who struggles</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>So doth the cony struggle in the net.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;</span><br/>
<span id='64'>So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>What would your grace have done unto him now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>What! was it you that would be England's king?</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And made a preachment of your high descent?</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Where are your mess of sons to back you now?</span><br/>
<span id='74'>The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood</span><br/>
<span id='80'>That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Made issue from the bosom of the boy;</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And if thine eyes can water for his death,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>I should lament thy miserable state.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.</span><br/>
<span id='87'>What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails</span><br/>
<span id='88'>That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.</span><br/>
<p><em>Putting a paper crown on his head</em></p>
<span id='96'>Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>And this is he was his adopted heir.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>But how is it that great Plantagenet</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?</span><br/>
<span id='101'>As I bethink me, you should not be king</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And rob his temples of the diadem,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Now in his life, against your holy oath?</span><br/>
<span id='106'>O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>That is my office, for my father's sake.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!</span><br/>
<span id='113'>How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex</span><br/>
<span id='114'>To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!</span><br/>
<span id='116'>But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Made impudent with use of evil deeds,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.</span><br/>
<span id='119'>To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?</span><br/>
<span id='125'>It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Unless the adage must be verified,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>That beggars mounted run their horse to death.</span><br/>
<span id='128'>'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;</span><br/>
<span id='129'>But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:</span><br/>
<span id='132'>'Tis government that makes them seem divine;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>The want thereof makes thee abominable:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Thou art as opposite to every good</span><br/>
<span id='135'>As the Antipodes are unto us,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Or as the south to the septentrion.</span><br/>
<span id='137'>O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!</span><br/>
<span id='138'>How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:</span><br/>
<span id='145'>For raging wind blows up incessant showers,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>And when the rage allays, the rain begins.</span><br/>
<span id='147'>These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:</span><br/>
<span id='148'>And every drop cries vengeance for his death,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Frenchwoman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so</span><br/>
<span id='152'>That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>That face of his the hungry cannibals</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood:</span><br/>
<span id='155'>But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.</span><br/>
<span id='157'>See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:</span><br/>
<span id='158'>This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And I with tears do wash the blood away.</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:</span><br/>
<span id='161'>And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'</span><br/>
<span id='165'>There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And in thy need such comfort come to thee</span><br/>
<span id='167'>As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world:</span><br/>
<span id='169'>My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>I should not for my life but weep with him.</span><br/>
<span id='172'>To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Think but upon the wrong he did us all,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='176'>Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.</span><br/>
<p><em>Stabbing him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.</span><br/>
<p><em>Stabbing him</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='178'>Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!</span><br/>
<span id='179'>My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>Dies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>QUEEN MARGARET</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Off with his head, and set it on York gates;</span><br/>
<span id='181'>So York may overlook the town of York.</span><br/>
<p><em>Flourish. Exeunt</em></p>

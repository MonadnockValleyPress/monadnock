<h1>King Lear</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene VI</h3>
<h4>Fields near Dover.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GLOUCESTER, and EDGAR dressed like a peasant</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>When shall we come to the top of that same hill?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Methinks the ground is even.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Horrible steep.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Hark, do you hear the sea?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>No, truly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect</span><br/>
<span id='8'>By your eyes' anguish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>So may it be, indeed:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st</span><br/>
<span id='11'>In better phrase and matter than thou didst.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed</span><br/>
<span id='13'>But in my garments.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Methinks you're better spoken.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!</span><br/>
<span id='17'>The crows and choughs that wing the midway air</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Topple down headlong.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Set me where you stand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Give me your hand: you are now within a foot</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Would I not leap upright.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Let go my hand.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Now fare you well, good sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>With all my heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Why I do trifle thus with his despair</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Is done to cure it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>[Kneeling]  O you mighty gods!</span><br/>
<span id='43'>This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Shake patiently my great affliction off:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>If I could bear it longer, and not fall</span><br/>
<span id='46'>To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>My snuff and loathed part of nature should</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Now, fellow, fare thee well.</span><br/>
<p><em>He falls forward</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Gone, sir: farewell.</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And yet I know not how conceit may rob</span><br/>
<span id='52'>The treasury of life, when life itself</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>What are you, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>                  Away, and let me die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>So many fathom down precipitating,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Ten masts at each make not the altitude</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>But have I fall'n, or no?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Alack, I have no eyes.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And frustrate his proud will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Give me your arm:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Too well, too well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>This is above all strangeness.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Which parted from you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>A poor unfortunate beggar.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>As I stood here below, methought his eyes</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Affliction till it do cry out itself</span><br/>
<span id='90'>'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>I took it for a man; often 'twould say</span><br/>
<span id='92'>'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers</em></p>
<span id='94'>The safer sense will ne'er accommodate</span><br/>
<span id='95'>His master thus.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the</span><br/>
<span id='97'>king himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>O thou side-piercing sight!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Nature's above art in that respect. There's your</span><br/>
<span id='100'>press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a</span><br/>
<span id='101'>crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted</span><br/>
<span id='103'>cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove</span><br/>
<span id='104'>it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well</span><br/>
<span id='105'>flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Give the word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Sweet marjoram.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Pass.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>I know that voice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered</span><br/>
<span id='111'>me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my</span><br/>
<span id='112'>beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'</span><br/>
<span id='113'>and 'no' to every thing that I said!&mdash;'Ay' and 'no'</span><br/>
<span id='114'>too was no good divinity. When the rain came to</span><br/>
<span id='115'>wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when</span><br/>
<span id='116'>the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I</span><br/>
<span id='117'>found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are</span><br/>
<span id='118'>not men o' their words: they told me I was every</span><br/>
<span id='119'>thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>The trick of that voice I do well remember:</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Is 't not the king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Ay, every inch a king:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.</span><br/>
<span id='124'>I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:</span><br/>
<span id='126'>The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Does lecher in my sight.</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Was kinder to his father than my daughters</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Got 'tween the lawful sheets.</span><br/>
<span id='131'>To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Behold yond simpering dame,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Whose face between her forks presages snow;</span><br/>
<span id='134'>That minces virtue, and does shake the head</span><br/>
<span id='135'>To hear of pleasure's name;</span><br/>
<span id='136'>The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't</span><br/>
<span id='137'>With a more riotous appetite.</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Down from the waist they are Centaurs,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Though women all above:</span><br/>
<span id='140'>But to the girdle do the gods inherit,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Beneath is all the fiends';</span><br/>
<span id='142'>There's hell, there's darkness, there's the</span><br/>
<span id='143'>sulphurous pit,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:</span><br/>
<span id='147'>there's money for thee.</span><br/>

<span id='speech40'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>O, let me kiss that hand!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?</span><br/>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>

<span id='156'>Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>EDGAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>I would not take this from report; it is,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>And my heart breaks at it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>

<span id='159'>Read.</span><br/>

<span id='speech47'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>

<span id='160'>What, with the case of eyes?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your</span><br/>
<span id='162'>head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in</span><br/>
<span id='163'>a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how</span><br/>
<span id='164'>this world goes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>I see it feelingly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes</span><br/>
<span id='167'>with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond</span><br/>
<span id='168'>justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in</span><br/>
<span id='169'>thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which</span><br/>
<span id='170'>is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen</span><br/>
<span id='171'>a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='172'>Ay, sir.</span><br/>

<span id='speech52'><strong>KING LEAR</strong></span>

<span id='173'>And the creature run from the cur? There thou</span><br/>

<span id='176'>Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind</span><br/>
<span id='179'>For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,</span><br/>

<span id='184'>None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:</span><br/>

<span id='186'>To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;</span><br/>

<h4>Scene I. A room in the castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>And can you, by no drift of circumstance,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Get from him why he puts on this confusion,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Grating so harshly all his days of quiet</span><br/>
<span id='4'>With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>He does confess he feels himself distracted;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>But from what cause he will by no means speak.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>When we would bring him on to some confession</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Of his true state.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>                  Did he receive you well?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Most like a gentleman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>GUILDENSTERN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>But with much forcing of his disposition.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Niggard of question; but, of our demands,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Most free in his reply.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Did you assay him?</span><br/>
<span id='17'>To any pastime?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>Madam, it so fell out, that certain players</span><br/>
<span id='19'>We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And there did seem in him a kind of joy</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To hear of it: they are about the court,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And, as I think, they have already order</span><br/>
<span id='23'>This night to play before him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>'Tis most true:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties</span><br/>
<span id='26'>To hear and see the matter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>With all my heart; and it doth much content me</span><br/>
<span id='28'>To hear him so inclined.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And drive his purpose on to these delights.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ROSENCRANTZ</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>We shall, my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>                  Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>That he, as 'twere by accident, may here</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Affront Ophelia:</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Her father and myself, lawful espials,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>We may of their encounter frankly judge,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And gather by him, as he is behaved,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>If 't be the affliction of his love or no</span><br/>
<span id='41'>That thus he suffers for.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>QUEEN GERTRUDE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>I shall obey you.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish</span><br/>
<span id='44'>That your good beauties be the happy cause</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Will bring him to his wonted way again,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>To both your honours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Madam, I wish it may.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>We will bestow ourselves.</span><br/>
<p><em>To OPHELIA</em></p>
<span id='51'>Read on this book;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>That show of such an exercise may colour</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>'Tis too much proved&mdash;that with devotion's visage</span><br/>
<span id='55'>And pious action we do sugar o'er</span><br/>
<span id='56'>The devil himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>[Aside]          O, 'tis too true!</span><br/>
<span id='58'>How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!</span><br/>
<span id='59'>The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Than is my deed to my most painted word:</span><br/>
<span id='62'>O heavy burthen!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS</em></p>
<p><em>Enter HAMLET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>To be, or not to be, that is the question,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer</span><br/>
<span id='66'>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>No more; and by a sleep to say we end</span><br/>
<span id='70'>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks</span><br/>
<span id='71'>That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;</span><br/>
<span id='73'>To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come</span><br/>
<span id='75'>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Must give us pause: there's the respect</span><br/>
<span id='77'>That makes calamity of so long life;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>The insolence of office and the spurns</span><br/>
<span id='82'>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>When he himself might his quietus make</span><br/>
<span id='84'>With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>But that the dread of something after death,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>The undiscover'd country from whose bourn</span><br/>
<span id='88'>No traveller returns, puzzles the will</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Than fly to others that we know not of?</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And thus the native hue of resolution</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And enterprises of great pith and moment</span><br/>
<span id='95'>With this regard their currents turn awry,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And lose the name of action.&mdash;Soft you now!</span><br/>
<span id='97'>The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Be all my sins remember'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Good my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>How does your honour for this many a day?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>I humbly thank you; well, well, well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>My lord, I have remembrances of yours,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>That I have longed long to re-deliver;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>I pray you, now receive them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>No, not I;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>I never gave you aught.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed</span><br/>
<span id='109'>As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Take these again; for to the noble mind</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.</span><br/>
<span id='112'>There, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Ha, ha! are you honest?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>My lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Are you fair?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>What means your lordship?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should</span><br/>
<span id='118'>admit no discourse to your beauty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than</span><br/>
<span id='120'>with honesty?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner</span><br/>
<span id='122'>transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the</span><br/>
<span id='123'>force of honesty can translate beauty into his</span><br/>
<span id='124'>likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the</span><br/>
<span id='125'>time gives it proof. I did love you once.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot</span><br/>
<span id='128'>so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of</span><br/>
<span id='129'>it: I loved you not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>I was the more deceived.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a</span><br/>
<span id='132'>breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>but yet I could accuse me of such things that it</span><br/>
<span id='134'>were better my mother had not borne me: I am very</span><br/>
<span id='135'>proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at</span><br/>
<span id='136'>my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>imagination to give them shape, or time to act them</span><br/>
<span id='138'>in. What should such fellows as I do crawling</span><br/>
<span id='139'>between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Where's your father?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>At home, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the</span><br/>
<span id='144'>fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>O, help him, you sweet heavens!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for</span><br/>
<span id='147'>thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as</span><br/>
<span id='148'>snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a</span><br/>
<span id='149'>nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs</span><br/>
<span id='150'>marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough</span><br/>
<span id='151'>what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>and quickly too. Farewell.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>O heavenly powers, restore him!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HAMLET</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God</span><br/>
<span id='155'>has given you one face, and you make yourselves</span><br/>
<span id='156'>another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and</span><br/>
<span id='157'>nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness</span><br/>
<span id='158'>your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath</span><br/>
<span id='159'>made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:</span><br/>
<span id='160'>those that are married already, all but one, shall</span><br/>
<span id='161'>live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a</span><br/>
<span id='162'>nunnery, go.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>OPHELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!</span><br/>
<span id='164'>The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;</span><br/>
<span id='165'>The expectancy and rose of the fair state,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>The glass of fashion and the mould of form,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!</span><br/>
<span id='168'>And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>That suck'd the honey of his music vows,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;</span><br/>
<span id='172'>That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>KING CLAUDIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='175'>Love! his affections do not that way tend;</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;</span><br/>
<span id='179'>And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Will be some danger: which for to prevent,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>I have in quick determination</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>For the demand of our neglected tribute</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Haply the seas and countries different</span><br/>
<span id='185'>With variable objects shall expel</span><br/>
<span id='186'>This something-settled matter in his heart,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus</span><br/>
<span id='188'>From fashion of himself. What think you on't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LORD POLONIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>It shall do well: but yet do I believe</span><br/>

<span id='192'>You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;</span><br/>

<h1>Richard II</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>London. A street leading to the Tower.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter QUEEN and Ladies</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>This way the king will come; this is the way</span><br/>
<span id='2'>To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>To whose flint bosom my condemned lord</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Have any resting for her true king's queen.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter KING RICHARD II and Guard</em></p>
<span id='7'>But soft, but see, or rather do not see,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>That you in pity may dissolve to dew,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>When triumph is become an alehouse guest?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>To think our former state a happy dream;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>From which awaked, the truth of what we are</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>To grim Necessity, and he and I</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And cloister thee in some religious house:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Which our profane hours here have stricken down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>What, is my Richard both in shape and mind</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?</span><br/>
<span id='29'>The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage</span><br/>
<span id='31'>To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And fawn on rage with base humility,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Which art a lion and a king of beasts?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>I had been still a happy king of men.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire</span><br/>
<span id='41'>With good old folks and let them tell thee tales</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Of woeful ages long ago betid;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Tell thou the lamentable tale of me</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And send the hearers weeping to their beds:</span><br/>
<span id='46'>For why, the senseless brands will sympathize</span><br/>
<span id='47'>The heavy accent of thy moving tongue</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And in compassion weep the fire out;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>For the deposing of a rightful king.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter NORTHUMBERLAND and others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;</span><br/>
<span id='54'>With all swift speed you must away to France.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal</span><br/>
<span id='56'>The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>The time shall not be many hours of age</span><br/>
<span id='58'>More than it is ere foul sin gathering head</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Though he divide the realm and give thee half,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>It is too little, helping him to all;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way</span><br/>
<span id='63'>To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Being ne'er so little urged, another way</span><br/>
<span id='65'>To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>The love of wicked men converts to fear;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both</span><br/>
<span id='68'>To worthy danger and deserved death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>My guilt be on my head, and there an end.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate</span><br/>
<span id='72'>A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And then betwixt me and my married wife.</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>She came adorned hither like sweet May,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>And must we be divided? must we part?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Banish us both and send the king with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>That were some love but little policy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Then whither he goes, thither let me go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>So two, together weeping, make one woe.</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>So longest way shall have the longest moans.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And piece the way out with a heavy heart.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>QUEEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part</span><br/>
<span id='98'>To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>So, now I have mine own again, be gone,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>That I might strive to kill it with a groan.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>We make woe wanton with this fond delay:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Antony and Cleopatra</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Alexandria. Octavius Caesar's camp.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MECAENAS, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, and others, his council of war</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks</span><br/>
<span id='3'>The pauses that he makes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DOLABELLA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Caesar, I shall.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
<p><em>Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Appear thus to us?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DERCETAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>                  I am call'd Dercetas;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>He was my master; and I wore my life</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To spend upon his haters. If thou please</span><br/>
<span id='12'>To take me to thee, as I was to him</span><br/>
<span id='13'>I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>I yield thee up my life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>What is't thou say'st?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DERCETAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>The breaking of so great a thing should make</span><br/>
<span id='18'>A greater crack: the round world</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Should have shook lions into civil streets,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Is not a single doom; in the name lay</span><br/>
<span id='22'>A moiety of the world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DERCETAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>He is dead, Caesar:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Not by a public minister of justice,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Which writ his honour in the acts it did,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Splitted the heart. This is his sword;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd</span><br/>
<span id='30'>With his most noble blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Look you sad, friends?</span><br/>
<span id='32'>The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings</span><br/>
<span id='33'>To wash the eyes of kings.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>AGRIPPA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>And strange it is,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>That nature must compel us to lament</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Our most persisted deeds.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MECAENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>His taints and honours</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Waged equal with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>AGRIPPA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>A rarer spirit never</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MECAENAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>When such a spacious mirror's set before him,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>He needs must see himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>O Antony!</span><br/>
<span id='45'>I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Have shown to thee such a declining day,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Or look on thine; we could not stall together</span><br/>
<span id='49'>In the whole world: but yet let me lament,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>That thou, my brother, my competitor</span><br/>
<span id='52'>In top of all design, my mate in empire,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Friend and companion in the front of war,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>The arm of mine own body, and the heart</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Where mine his thoughts did kindle,&mdash;that our stars,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Unreconciliable, should divide</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>But I will tell you at some meeter season:</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter an Egyptian</em></p>
<span id='59'>The business of this man looks out of him;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Egyptian</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Confined in all she has, her monument,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Of thy intents desires instruction,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>That she preparedly may frame herself</span><br/>
<span id='65'>To the way she's forced to.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Bid her have good heart:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>How honourable and how kindly we</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live</span><br/>
<span id='70'>To be ungentle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Egyptian</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>So the gods preserve thee!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts</span><br/>
<span id='74'>The quality of her passion shall require,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke</span><br/>
<span id='76'>She do defeat us; for her life in Rome</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Would be eternal in our triumph: go,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And with your speediest bring us what she says,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>And how you find of her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PROCULEIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Caesar, I shall.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Gallus, go you along.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit GALLUS</em></p>
<span id='82'>Where's Dolabella,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>To second Proculeius?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>All</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Dolabella!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Let him alone, for I remember now</span><br/>
<span id='86'>How he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready.</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Go with me to my tent; where you shall see</span><br/>
<span id='88'>How hardly I was drawn into this war;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>How calm and gentle I proceeded still</span><br/>
<span id='90'>In all my writings: go with me, and see</span><br/>
<span id='91'>What I can show in this.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

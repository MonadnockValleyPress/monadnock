<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Rousillon. The Count's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter COUNTESS and Steward</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Alas! and would you take the letter of her?</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Might you not know she would do as she has done,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>By sending me a letter? Read it again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Steward</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>[Reads]</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Ambitious love hath so in me offended,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>With sainted vow my faults to have amended.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Write, write, that from the bloody course of war</span><br/>
<span id='10'>My dearest master, your dear son, may hie:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far</span><br/>
<span id='12'>His name with zealous fervor sanctify:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>His taken labours bid him me forgive;</span><br/>
<span id='14'>I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth</span><br/>
<span id='15'>From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth:</span><br/>
<span id='17'>He is too good and fair for death and me:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Whom I myself embrace, to set him free.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>I could have well diverted her intents,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Which thus she hath prevented.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Steward</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Pardon me, madam:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>If I had given you this at over-night,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>She might have been o'erta'en; and yet she writes,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Pursuit would be but vain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>What angel shall</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>To this unworthy husband of his wife;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Let every word weigh heavy of her worth</span><br/>
<span id='35'>That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Dispatch the most convenient messenger:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>When haply he shall hear that she is gone,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>He will return; and hope I may that she,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Led hither by pure love: which of them both</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense</span><br/>
<span id='43'>To make distinction: provide this messenger:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>All's Well That Ends Well</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Rousillon. The Count's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter COUNTESS and Clown</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of</span><br/>
<span id='2'>your breeding.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I</span><br/>
<span id='4'>know my business is but to the court.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>To the court! why, what place make you special,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he</span><br/>
<span id='8'>may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make</span><br/>
<span id='9'>a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed</span><br/>
<span id='11'>such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the</span><br/>
<span id='12'>court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all</span><br/>
<span id='13'>men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all</span><br/>
<span id='15'>questions.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn</span><br/>
<span id='18'>buttock, or any buttock.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Will your answer serve fit to all questions?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib's</span><br/>
<span id='22'>rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his</span><br/>
<span id='24'>hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen</span><br/>
<span id='25'>to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the</span><br/>
<span id='26'>friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all</span><br/>
<span id='28'>questions?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>From below your duke to beneath your constable, it</span><br/>
<span id='30'>will fit any question.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>It must be an answer of most monstrous size that</span><br/>
<span id='32'>must fit all demands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned</span><br/>
<span id='34'>should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that</span><br/>
<span id='35'>belongs to't. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall</span><br/>
<span id='36'>do you no harm to learn.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in</span><br/>
<span id='38'>question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I</span><br/>
<span id='39'>pray you, sir, are you a courtier?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>more, a hundred of them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>O Lord, sir! spare not me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and</span><br/>
<span id='49'>'spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very</span><br/>
<span id='50'>sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well</span><br/>
<span id='51'>to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>sir!' I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>I play the noble housewife with the time</span><br/>
<span id='55'>To entertain't so merrily with a fool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>O Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>An end, sir; to your business. Give Helen this,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>And urge her to a present answer back:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>This is not much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Not much commendation to them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Not much employment for you: you understand me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Clown</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>COUNTESS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Haste you again.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt severally</em></p>

<h1>The Comedy of Errors</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>A street before a Priory.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Second Merchant and ANGELO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;</span><br/>
<span id='2'>But, I protest, he had the chain of me,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Second Merchant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>How is the man esteemed here in the city?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Of very reverend reputation, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Of credit infinite, highly beloved,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Second to none that lives here in the city:</span><br/>
<span id='8'>His word might bear my wealth at any time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Second Merchant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Which he forswore most monstrously to have.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Signior Antipholus, I wonder much</span><br/>
<span id='14'>That you would put me to this shame and trouble;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And, not without some scandal to yourself,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>With circumstance and oaths so to deny</span><br/>
<span id='17'>This chain which now you wear so openly:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>You have done wrong to this my honest friend,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Who, but for staying on our controversy,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>This chain you had of me; can you deny it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>I think I had; I never did deny it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Second Merchant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Second Merchant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>These ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest</span><br/>
<span id='28'>To walk where any honest man resort.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Second Merchant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.</span><br/>
<p><em>They draw</em></p>
<p><em>Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Some get within him, take his sword away:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Run, master, run; for God's sake, take a house!</span><br/>
<span id='37'>This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse to the Priory</em></p>
<p><em>Enter the Lady Abbess, AEMILIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>AEMELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Let us come in, that we may bind him fast</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And bear him home for his recovery.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>I knew he was not in his perfect wits.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Second Merchant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>I am sorry now that I did draw on him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>AEMELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>How long hath this possession held the man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And much different from the man he was;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>But till this afternoon his passion</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>AEMELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?</span><br/>
<span id='52'>A sin prevailing much in youthful men,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Which of these sorrows is he subject to?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>To none of these, except it be the last;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>AEMELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>You should for that have reprehended him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Why, so I did.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>AEMELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>                  Ay, but not rough enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>As roughly as my modesty would let me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>AEMELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Haply, in private.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>And in assemblies too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>AEMELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Ay, but not enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>It was the copy of our conference:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>In bed he slept not for my urging it;</span><br/>
<span id='66'>At board he fed not for my urging it;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Alone, it was the subject of my theme;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>In company I often glanced it;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>AEMELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>And thereof came it that the man was mad.</span><br/>
<span id='71'>The venom clamours of a jealous woman</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>And therefore comes it that his head is light.</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Unquiet meals make ill digestions;</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And what's a fever but a fit of madness?</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue</span><br/>
<span id='81'>But moody and dull melancholy,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And at her heels a huge infectious troop</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?</span><br/>
<span id='85'>In food, in sport and life-preserving rest</span><br/>
<span id='86'>To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:</span><br/>
<span id='87'>The consequence is then thy jealous fits</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>She never reprehended him but mildly,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>She did betray me to my own reproof.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Good people enter and lay hold on him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>AEMELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>No, not a creature enters in my house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Then let your servants bring my husband forth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>AEMELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>And it shall privilege him from your hands</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Till I have brought him to his wits again,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Or lose my labour in assaying it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>I will attend my husband, be his nurse,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Diet his sickness, for it is my office,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>And will have no attorney but myself;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And therefore let me have him home with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>AEMELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Be patient; for I will not let him stir</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Till I have used the approved means I have,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>To make of him a formal man again:</span><br/>
<span id='108'>It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>A charitable duty of my order.</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Therefore depart and leave him here with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>I will not hence and leave my husband here:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And ill it doth beseem your holiness</span><br/>
<span id='113'>To separate the husband and the wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>AEMELIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Complain unto the duke of this indignity.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And never rise until my tears and prayers</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Have won his grace to come in person hither</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And take perforce my husband from the abbess.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Second Merchant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>By this, I think, the dial points at five:</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Comes this way to the melancholy vale,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>The place of death and sorry execution,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Behind the ditches of the abbey here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Upon what cause?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Second Merchant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Who put unluckily into this bay</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Against the laws and statutes of this town,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Beheaded publicly for his offence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>See where they come: we will behold his death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter DUKE SOLINUS, attended; AEGEON bareheaded; with the Headsman and other Officers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>DUKE SOLINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Yet once again proclaim it publicly,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>If any friend will pay the sum for him,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>He shall not die; so much we tender him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>DUKE SOLINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:</span><br/>
<span id='137'>It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Whom I made lord of me and all I had,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>At your important letters,&mdash;this ill day</span><br/>
<span id='141'>A most outrageous fit of madness took him;</span><br/>
<span id='142'>That desperately he hurried through the street,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>With him his bondman, all as mad as he&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Doing displeasure to the citizens</span><br/>
<span id='145'>By rushing in their houses, bearing thence</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Once did I get him bound and sent him home,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>That here and there his fury had committed.</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>He broke from those that had the guard of him;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>And with his mad attendant and himself,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Met us again and madly bent on us,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>We came again to bind them. Then they fled</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:</span><br/>
<span id='158'>And here the abbess shuts the gates on us</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And will not suffer us to fetch him out,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>DUKE SOLINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>Long since thy husband served me in my wars,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>And I to thee engaged a prince's word,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>When thou didst make him master of thy bed,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>To do him all the grace and good I could.</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate</span><br/>
<span id='168'>And bid the lady abbess come to me.</span><br/>
<span id='169'>I will determine this before I stir.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Servant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!</span><br/>
<span id='171'>My master and his man are both broke loose,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;</span><br/>
<span id='174'>And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:</span><br/>
<span id='176'>My master preaches patience to him and the while</span><br/>
<span id='177'>His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>And sure, unless you send some present help,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Between them they will kill the conjurer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>And that is false thou dost report to us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;</span><br/>
<span id='183'>I have not breathed almost since I did see it.</span><br/>
<span id='184'>He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>To scorch your face and to disfigure you.</span><br/>
<p><em>Cry within</em></p>
<span id='186'>Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>DUKE SOLINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>That he is borne about invisible:</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Even now we housed him in the abbey here;</span><br/>
<span id='191'>And now he's there, past thought of human reason.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice!</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Even for the service that long since I did thee,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>When I bestrid thee in the wars and took</span><br/>
<span id='195'>Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood</span><br/>
<span id='196'>That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>AEGEON</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='197'>Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!</span><br/>
<span id='200'>She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,</span><br/>
<span id='201'>That hath abused and dishonour'd me</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Even in the strength and height of injury!</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Beyond imagination is the wrong</span><br/>
<span id='204'>That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>DUKE SOLINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='205'>Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='206'>This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>While she with harlots feasted in my house.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>DUKE SOLINUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='208'>A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>ADRIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='209'>No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister</span><br/>
<span id='210'>To-day did dine together. So befall my soul</span><br/>
<span id='211'>As this is false he burdens me withal!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>LUCIANA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='212'>Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,</span><br/>
<span id='213'>But she tells to your highness simple truth!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>ANGELO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:</span><br/>
<span id='215'>In this the madman justly chargeth them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>My liege, I am advised what I say,</span><br/>
<span id='217'>Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,</span><br/>
<span id='218'>Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.</span><br/>
<span id='220'>This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:</span><br/>
<span id='221'>That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,</span><br/>
<span id='222'>Could witness it, for he was with me then;</span><br/>
<span id='223'>Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,</span><br/>
<span id='224'>Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,</span><br/>
<span id='225'>Where Balthazar and I did dine together.</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,</span><br/>
<span id='227'>I went to seek him: in the street I met him</span><br/>
<span id='228'>And in his company that gentleman.</span><br/>
<span id='229'>There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down</span><br/>
<span id='230'>That I this day of him received the chain,</span><br/>
<span id='231'>Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which</span><br/>
<span id='232'>He did arrest me with an officer.</span><br/>
<span id='233'>I did obey, and sent my peasant home</span><br/>
<span id='234'>For certain ducats: he with none return'd</span><br/>
<span id='235'>Then fairly I bespoke the officer</span><br/>
<span id='236'>To go in person with me to my house.</span><br/>
<span id='237'>By the way we met</span><br/>
<span id='237'>My wife, her sister, and a rabble more</span><br/>
<span id='238'>Of vile confederates. Along with them</span><br/>
<span id='239'>They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,</span><br/>
<span id='240'>A mere anatomy, a mountebank,</span><br/>
<span id='241'>A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,</span><br/>
<span id='242'>A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,</span><br/>
<span id='243'>A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,</span><br/>
<span id='244'>Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,</span><br/>
<span id='245'>And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,</span><br/>
<span id='246'>And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,</span><br/>
<span id='247'>Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together</span><br/>
<span id='248'>They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence</span><br/>
<span id='249'>And in a dark and dankish vault at home</span><br/>
<span id='250'>There left me and my man, both bound together;</span><br/>
<span id='251'>Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,</span><br/>
<span id='252'>I gain'd my freedom, and immediately</span><br/>
<span id='253'>Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech</span><br/>
<span id='254'>To give me ample satisfaction</span><br/>

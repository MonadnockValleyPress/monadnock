<h1>Henry VIII</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>A Hall in York Place.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Hautboys. A small table under a state for CARDINAL  WOLSEY, a longer table for the guests. Then enter  ANNE and divers other Ladies and Gentlemen as  guests, at one door; at another door, enter GUILDFORD</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GUILDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Ladies, a general welcome from his grace</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Salutes ye all; this night he dedicates</span><br/>
<span id='3'>To fair content and you: none here, he hopes,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>In all this noble bevy, has brought with her</span><br/>
<span id='5'>One care abroad; he would have all as merry</span><br/>
<span id='6'>As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Can make good people. O, my lord, you're tardy:</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Chamberlain, SANDS, and LOVELL</em></p>
<span id='8'>The very thought of this fair company</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Clapp'd wings to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>You are young, Sir Harry Guildford.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SANDS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Sir Thomas Lovell, had the cardinal</span><br/>
<span id='12'>But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Should find a running banquet ere they rested,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>I think would better please 'em: by my life,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>They are a sweet society of fair ones.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>O, that your lordship were but now confessor</span><br/>
<span id='17'>To one or two of these!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SANDS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>I would I were;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>They should find easy penance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Faith, how easy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SANDS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>As easy as a down-bed would afford it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Sweet ladies, will it please you sit? Sir Harry,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Place you that side; I'll take the charge of this:</span><br/>
<span id='24'>His grace is entering. Nay, you must not freeze;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Two women placed together makes cold weather:</span><br/>
<span id='26'>My Lord Sands, you are one will keep 'em waking;</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Pray, sit between these ladies.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SANDS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>By my faith,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And thank your lordship. By your leave, sweet ladies:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>I had it from my father.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Was he mad, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SANDS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>But he would bite none; just as I do now,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>He would kiss you twenty with a breath.</span><br/>
<p><em>Kisses her</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Well said, my lord.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>So, now you're fairly seated. Gentlemen,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>The penance lies on you, if these fair ladies</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Pass away frowning.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SANDS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>For my little cure,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Let me alone.</span><br/>
<p><em>Hautboys. Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, and takes his state</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>You're welcome, my fair guests: that noble lady,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Or gentleman, that is not freely merry,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Is not my friend: this, to confirm my welcome;</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And to you all, good health.</span><br/>
<p><em>Drinks</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SANDS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Your grace is noble:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And save me so much talking.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>My Lord Sands,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>I am beholding to you: cheer your neighbours.</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Ladies, you are not merry: gentlemen,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Whose fault is this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SANDS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>The red wine first must rise</span><br/>
<span id='54'>In their fair cheeks, my lord; then we shall have 'em</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Talk us to silence.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>You are a merry gamester,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>My Lord Sands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SANDS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>                  Yes, if I make my play.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Here's to your ladyship: and pledge it, madam,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>For 'tis to such a thing,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ANNE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>You cannot show me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SANDS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I told your grace they would talk anon.</span><br/>
<p><em>Drum and trumpet, chambers discharged</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>What's that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Look out there, some of ye.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Servant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>What warlike voice,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And to what end is this? Nay, ladies, fear not;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>By all the laws of war you're privileged.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter Servant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>How now! what is't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>A noble troop of strangers;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>For so they seem: they've left their barge and landed;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>And hither make, as great ambassadors</span><br/>
<span id='72'>From foreign princes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Good lord chamberlain,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Go, give 'em welcome; you can speak the French tongue;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>And, pray, receive 'em nobly, and conduct 'em</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Into our presence, where this heaven of beauty</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Shall shine at full upon them. Some attend him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Chamberlain, attended. All rise, and tables removed</em></p>
<span id='78'>You have now a broken banquet; but we'll mend it.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>A good digestion to you all: and once more</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I shower a welcome on ye; welcome all.</span><br/>
<p><em>Hautboys. Enter KING HENRY VIII and others, as  masquers, habited like shepherds, ushered by the  Chamberlain. They pass directly before CARDINAL WOLSEY, and gracefully salute him</em></p>
<span id='81'>A noble company! what are their pleasures?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Because they speak no English, thus they pray'd</span><br/>
<span id='83'>To tell your grace, that, having heard by fame</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Of this so noble and so fair assembly</span><br/>
<span id='85'>This night to meet here, they could do no less</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Out of the great respect they bear to beauty,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>But leave their flocks; and, under your fair conduct,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat</span><br/>
<span id='89'>An hour of revels with 'em.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Say, lord chamberlain,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>They have done my poor house grace; for which I pay 'em</span><br/>
<span id='92'>A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.</span><br/>
<p><em>They choose Ladies for the dance. KING HENRY VIII chooses ANNE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>The fairest hand I ever touch'd! O beauty,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Till now I never knew thee!</span><br/>
<p><em>Music. Dance</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>My lord!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Your grace?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Pray, tell 'em thus much from me:</span><br/>
<span id='98'>There should be one amongst 'em, by his person,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>More worthy this place than myself; to whom,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>If I but knew him, with my love and duty</span><br/>
<span id='101'>I would surrender it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>I will, my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Whispers the Masquers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>What say they?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>                  Such a one, they all confess,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>There is indeed; which they would have your grace</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Find out, and he will take it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Let me see, then.</span><br/>
<span id='108'>By all your good leaves, gentlemen; here I'll make</span><br/>
<span id='109'>My royal choice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>                  Ye have found him, cardinal:</span><br/>
<p><em>Unmasking</em></p>
<span id='111'>You hold a fair assembly; you do well, lord:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>You are a churchman, or, I'll tell you, cardinal,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>I should judge now unhappily.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>I am glad</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Your grace is grown so pleasant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>My lord chamberlain,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Prithee, come hither: what fair lady's that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>An't please your grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's daughter&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>The Viscount Rochford,&mdash;one of her highness' women.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>By heaven, she is a dainty one. Sweetheart,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>I were unmannerly, to take you out,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen!</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Let it go round.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready</span><br/>
<span id='125'>I' the privy chamber?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>Yes, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Your grace,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>I fear, with dancing is a little heated.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>I fear, too much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CARDINAL WOLSEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>                  There's fresher air, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>In the next chamber.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>KING HENRY VIII</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>Lead in your ladies, every one: sweet partner,</span><br/>
<span id='133'>I must not yet forsake you: let's be merry:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Good my lord cardinal, I have half a dozen healths</span><br/>
<span id='135'>To drink to these fair ladies, and a measure</span><br/>
<span id='136'>To lead 'em once again; and then let's dream</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Who's best in favour. Let the music knock it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt with trumpets</em></p>

<h1>Troilus and Cressida</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</H3>
<h4>Troy. A room in Priam's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter PRIAM, HECTOR, TROILUS, PARIS, and HELENUS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PRIAM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:</span><br/>
<span id='3'>'Deliver Helen, and all damage else&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed</span><br/>
<span id='6'>In hot digestion of this cormorant war&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>HECTOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I</span><br/>
<span id='9'>As far as toucheth my particular,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Yet, dread Priam,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>There is no lady of more softer bowels,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches</span><br/>
<span id='17'>To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Since the first sword was drawn about this question,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>If we have lost so many tenths of ours,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Had it our name, the value of one ten,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>What merit's in that reason which denies</span><br/>
<span id='25'>The yielding of her up?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Fie, fie, my brother!</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Weigh you the worth and honour of a king</span><br/>
<span id='28'>So great as our dread father in a scale</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Of common ounces? will you with counters sum</span><br/>
<span id='30'>The past proportion of his infinite?</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And buckle in a waist most fathomless</span><br/>
<span id='32'>With spans and inches so diminutive</span><br/>
<span id='33'>As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HELENUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>You are so empty of them. Should not our father</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Because your speech hath none that tells him so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>You fur your gloves with reason. Here are</span><br/>
<span id='40'>your reasons:</span><br/>
<span id='41'>You know an enemy intends you harm;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>You know a sword employ'd is perilous,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And reason flies the object of all harm:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds</span><br/>
<span id='45'>A Grecian and his sword, if he do set</span><br/>
<span id='46'>The very wings of reason to his heels</span><br/>
<span id='47'>And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat</span><br/>
<span id='51'>their thoughts</span><br/>
<span id='52'>With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Make livers pale and lustihood deject.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>HECTOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost</span><br/>
<span id='55'>The holding.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>                  What is aught, but as 'tis valued?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HECTOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>But value dwells not in particular will;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>It holds his estimate and dignity</span><br/>
<span id='59'>As well wherein 'tis precious of itself</span><br/>
<span id='60'>As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry</span><br/>
<span id='61'>To make the service greater than the god</span><br/>
<span id='62'>And the will dotes that is attributive</span><br/>
<span id='63'>To what infectiously itself affects,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Without some image of the affected merit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>I take to-day a wife, and my election</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Is led on in the conduct of my will;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Although my will distaste what it elected,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>The wife I chose? there can be no evasion</span><br/>
<span id='72'>To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands</span><br/>
<span id='75'>We do not throw in unrespective sieve,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Because we now are full. It was thought meet</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.</span><br/>
<span id='88'>If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='89'>As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='90'>If you'll confess he brought home noble prize&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And cried 'Inestimable!'&mdash;why do you now</span><br/>
<span id='93'>The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And do a deed that fortune never did,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Beggar the estimation which you prized</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!</span><br/>
<span id='98'>But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>That in their country did them that disgrace,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>We fear to warrant in our native place!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CASSANDRA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>[Within]  Cry, Trojans, cry!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PRIAM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>What noise? what shriek is this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CASSANDRA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>[Within]  Cry, Trojans!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HECTOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>It is Cassandra.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter CASSANDRA, raving</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CASSANDRA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Cry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And I will fill them with prophetic tears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HECTOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Peace, sister, peace!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CASSANDRA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes</span><br/>
<span id='112'>A moiety of that mass of moan to come.</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>HECTOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Of divination in our sister work</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Some touches of remorse? or is your blood</span><br/>
<span id='121'>So madly hot that no discourse of reason,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Can qualify the same?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>Why, brother Hector,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>We may not think the justness of each act</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Such and no other than event doth form it,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Nor once deject the courage of our minds,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Which hath our several honours all engaged</span><br/>
<span id='131'>To make it gracious. For my private part,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Such things as might offend the weakest spleen</span><br/>
<span id='135'>To fight for and maintain!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>PARIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Else might the world convince of levity</span><br/>
<span id='137'>As well my undertakings as your counsels:</span><br/>
<span id='138'>But I attest the gods, your full consent</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Gave wings to my propension and cut off</span><br/>
<span id='140'>All fears attending on so dire a project.</span><br/>
<span id='141'>For what, alas, can these my single arms?</span><br/>
<span id='142'>What Propugnation is in one man's valour,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>To stand the push and enmity of those</span><br/>
<span id='144'>This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,</span><br/>
<span id='145'>Were I alone to pass the difficulties</span><br/>
<span id='146'>And had as ample power as I have will,</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Nor faint in the pursuit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PRIAM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Paris, you speak</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Like one besotted on your sweet delights:</span><br/>
<span id='151'>You have the honey still, but these the gall;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>So to be valiant is no praise at all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PARIS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Sir, I propose not merely to myself</span><br/>
<span id='154'>The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;</span><br/>
<span id='155'>But I would have the soil of her fair rape</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.</span><br/>
<span id='157'>What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Now to deliver her possession up</span><br/>
<span id='160'>On terms of base compulsion! Can it be</span><br/>
<span id='161'>That so degenerate a strain as this</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?</span><br/>
<span id='163'>There's not the meanest spirit on our party</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Without a heart to dare or sword to draw</span><br/>
<span id='165'>When Helen is defended, nor none so noble</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Where Helen is the subject; then, I say,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>The world's large spaces cannot parallel.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HECTOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>And on the cause and question now in hand</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Have glozed, but superficially: not much</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Unfit to hear moral philosophy:</span><br/>
<span id='175'>The reasons you allege do more conduce</span><br/>
<span id='176'>To the hot passion of distemper'd blood</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Than to make up a free determination</span><br/>
<span id='178'>'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Of any true decision. Nature craves</span><br/>
<span id='181'>All dues be render'd to their owners: now,</span><br/>
<span id='182'>What nearer debt in all humanity</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Than wife is to the husband? If this law</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Of nature be corrupted through affection,</span><br/>
<span id='185'>And that great minds, of partial indulgence</span><br/>
<span id='186'>To their benumbed wills, resist the same,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>There is a law in each well-order'd nation</span><br/>
<span id='188'>To curb those raging appetites that are</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Most disobedient and refractory.</span><br/>
<span id='190'>If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>As it is known she is, these moral laws</span><br/>
<span id='192'>Of nature and of nations speak aloud</span><br/>
<span id='193'>To have her back return'd: thus to persist</span><br/>
<span id='194'>In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,</span><br/>
<span id='195'>But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,</span><br/>
<span id='197'>My spritely brethren, I propend to you</span><br/>
<span id='198'>In resolution to keep Helen still,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Upon our joint and several dignities.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>TROILUS</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>Why, there you touch'd the life of our design:</span><br/>
<span id='202'>Were it not glory that we more affected</span><br/>
<span id='203'>Than the performance of our heaving spleens,</span><br/>
<span id='204'>I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>She is a theme of honour and renown,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,</span><br/>
<span id='208'>Whose present courage may beat down our foes,</span><br/>
<span id='209'>And fame in time to come canonize us;</span><br/>
<span id='210'>For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose</span><br/>
<span id='211'>So rich advantage of a promised glory</span><br/>
<span id='212'>As smiles upon the forehead of this action</span><br/>
<span id='213'>For the wide world's revenue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>HECTOR</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>I am yours,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>You valiant offspring of great Priamus.</span><br/>
<span id='216'>I have a roisting challenge sent amongst</span><br/>
<span id='217'>The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks</span><br/>
<span id='218'>Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:</span><br/>
<span id='219'>I was advertised their great general slept,</span><br/>
<span id='220'>Whilst emulation in the army crept:</span><br/>
<span id='221'>This, I presume, will wake him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

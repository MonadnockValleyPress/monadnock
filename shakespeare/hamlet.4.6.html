<h4>Scene VI. Another room in the castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter HORATIO and a Servant</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>What are they that would speak with me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Let them come in.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Servant</em></p>
<span id='4'>I do not know from what part of the world</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter Sailors</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>First Sailor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>God bless you, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Let him bless thee too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>First Sailor</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for</span><br/>
<span id='9'>you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was</span><br/>
<span id='10'>bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am</span><br/>
<span id='11'>let to know it is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>HORATIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>[Reads]  'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked</span><br/>
<span id='13'>this, give these fellows some means to the king:</span><br/>
<span id='14'>they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old</span><br/>
<span id='15'>at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us</span><br/>
<span id='16'>chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on</span><br/>
<span id='17'>a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded</span><br/>
<span id='18'>them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with</span><br/>
<span id='20'>me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they</span><br/>
<span id='21'>did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king</span><br/>
<span id='22'>have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me</span><br/>
<span id='23'>with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I</span><br/>
<span id='24'>have words to speak in thine ear will make thee</span><br/>
<span id='25'>dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of</span><br/>
<span id='26'>the matter. These good fellows will bring thee</span><br/>
<span id='27'>where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their</span><br/>
<span id='28'>course for England: of them I have much to tell</span><br/>
<span id='29'>thee. Farewell.</span><br/>
<span id='30'>'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Come, I will make you way for these your letters;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And do't the speedier, that you may direct me</span><br/>
<span id='33'>To him from whom you brought them.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

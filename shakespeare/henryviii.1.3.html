<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</h3>
<h4>An ante-chamber in the palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter Chamberlain and SANDS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Is't possible the spells of France should juggle</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Men into such strange mysteries?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SANDS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>New customs,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Though they be never so ridiculous,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Nay, let 'em be unmanly, yet are follow'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>As far as I see, all the good our English</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Have got by the late voyage is but merely</span><br/>
<span id='8'>A fit or two o' the face; but they are shrewd ones;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>For when they hold 'em, you would swear directly</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Their very noses had been counsellors</span><br/>
<span id='11'>To Pepin or Clotharius, they keep state so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SANDS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>They have all new legs, and lame ones: one would take it,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>That never saw 'em pace before, the spavin</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Or springhalt reign'd among 'em.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Death! my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Their clothes are after such a pagan cut too,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>That, sure, they've worn out Christendom.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter LOVELL</em></p>
<span id='18'>How now!</span><br/>
<span id='19'>What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Faith, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>I hear of none, but the new proclamation</span><br/>
<span id='22'>That's clapp'd upon the court-gate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>What is't for?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>The reformation of our travell'd gallants,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>I'm glad 'tis there: now I would pray our monsieurs</span><br/>
<span id='27'>To think an English courtier may be wise,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And never see the Louvre.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>They must either,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>For so run the conditions, leave those remnants</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Of fool and feather that they got in France,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>With all their honourable point of ignorance</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Pertaining thereunto, as fights and fireworks,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Abusing better men than they can be,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Out of a foreign wisdom, renouncing clean</span><br/>
<span id='36'>The faith they have in tennis, and tall stockings,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Short blister'd breeches, and those types of travel,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And understand again like honest men;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Or pack to their old playfellows: there, I take it,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>They may, 'cum privilegio,' wear away</span><br/>
<span id='41'>The lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SANDS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>'Tis time to give 'em physic, their diseases</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Are grown so catching.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>What a loss our ladies</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Will have of these trim vanities!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Ay, marry,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>There will be woe indeed, lords: the sly whoresons</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SANDS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>The devil fiddle 'em! I am glad they are going,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>For, sure, there's no converting of 'em: now</span><br/>
<span id='52'>An honest country lord, as I am, beaten</span><br/>
<span id='53'>A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong</span><br/>
<span id='54'>And have an hour of hearing; and, by'r lady,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Held current music too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Well said, Lord Sands;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Your colt's tooth is not cast yet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>SANDS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>No, my lord;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Nor shall not, while I have a stump.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Sir Thomas,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Whither were you a-going?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>To the cardinal's:</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Your lordship is a guest too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>O, 'tis true:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>This night he makes a supper, and a great one,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>To many lords and ladies; there will be</span><br/>
<span id='67'>The beauty of this kingdom, I'll assure you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LOVELL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>His dews fall every where.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>No doubt he's noble;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>He had a black mouth that said other of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SANDS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>He may, my lord; has wherewithal: in him</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Men of his way should be most liberal;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>They are set here for examples.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Chamberlain</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>True, they are so:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>But few now give so great ones. My barge stays;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Your lordship shall along. Come, good Sir Thomas,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>We shall be late else; which I would not be,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>For I was spoke to, with Sir Henry Guildford</span><br/>
<span id='82'>This night to be comptrollers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>SANDS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>I am your lordship's.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

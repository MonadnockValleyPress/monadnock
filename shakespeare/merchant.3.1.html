<h1>The Merchant of Venice</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Venice. A street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter SALANIO and SALARINO</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SALANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now, what news on the Rialto?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SALARINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath</span><br/>
<span id='3'>a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very</span><br/>
<span id='5'>dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many</span><br/>
<span id='6'>a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip</span><br/>
<span id='7'>report be an honest woman of her word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SALANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever</span><br/>
<span id='9'>knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she</span><br/>
<span id='10'>wept for the death of a third husband. But it is</span><br/>
<span id='11'>true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the</span><br/>
<span id='12'>plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the</span><br/>
<span id='13'>honest Antonio,&mdash;O that I had a title good enough</span><br/>
<span id='14'>to keep his name company!&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SALARINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Come, the full stop.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SALANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath</span><br/>
<span id='17'>lost a ship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SALARINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>I would it might prove the end of his losses.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SALANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my</span><br/>
<span id='20'>prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SHYLOCK</em></p>
<span id='21'>How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my</span><br/>
<span id='23'>daughter's flight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SALARINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor</span><br/>
<span id='25'>that made the wings she flew withal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SALANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was</span><br/>
<span id='27'>fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all</span><br/>
<span id='28'>to leave the dam.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>She is damned for it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SALANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>My own flesh and blood to rebel!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SALANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>SALARINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>There is more difference between thy flesh and hers</span><br/>
<span id='35'>than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods</span><br/>
<span id='36'>than there is between red wine and rhenish. But</span><br/>
<span id='37'>tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any</span><br/>
<span id='38'>loss at sea or no?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a</span><br/>
<span id='40'>prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon</span><br/>
<span id='42'>the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to</span><br/>
<span id='43'>call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was</span><br/>
<span id='44'>wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him</span><br/>
<span id='45'>look to his bond.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SALARINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take</span><br/>
<span id='47'>his flesh: what's that good for?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and</span><br/>
<span id='50'>hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my</span><br/>
<span id='52'>bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine</span><br/>
<span id='53'>enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath</span><br/>
<span id='54'>not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with</span><br/>
<span id='56'>the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject</span><br/>
<span id='57'>to the same diseases, healed by the same means,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as</span><br/>
<span id='59'>a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?</span><br/>
<span id='60'>if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison</span><br/>
<span id='61'>us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not</span><br/>
<span id='62'>revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will</span><br/>
<span id='63'>resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian</span><br/>
<span id='65'>wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you</span><br/>
<span id='67'>teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I</span><br/>
<span id='68'>will better the instruction.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Servant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Servant</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and</span><br/>
<span id='70'>desires to speak with you both.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SALARINO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>We have been up and down to seek him.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter TUBAL</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SALANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be</span><br/>
<span id='73'>matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt SALANIO, SALARINO, and Servant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou</span><br/>
<span id='75'>found my daughter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>TUBAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse</span><br/>
<span id='79'>never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it</span><br/>
<span id='80'>till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other</span><br/>
<span id='81'>precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter</span><br/>
<span id='82'>were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!</span><br/>
<span id='83'>would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in</span><br/>
<span id='84'>her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know</span><br/>
<span id='85'>not what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon</span><br/>
<span id='86'>loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to</span><br/>
<span id='87'>find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:</span><br/>
<span id='88'>nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my</span><br/>
<span id='89'>shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears</span><br/>
<span id='90'>but of my shedding.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>TUBAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I</span><br/>
<span id='92'>heard in Genoa,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>TUBAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>TUBAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!</span><br/>
<span id='98'>ha, ha! where? in Genoa?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>TUBAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one</span><br/>
<span id='100'>night fourscore ducats.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my</span><br/>
<span id='102'>gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!</span><br/>
<span id='103'>fourscore ducats!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>TUBAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my</span><br/>
<span id='105'>company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture</span><br/>
<span id='107'>him: I am glad of it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>TUBAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>One of them showed me a ring that he had of your</span><br/>
<span id='109'>daughter for a monkey.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my</span><br/>
<span id='111'>turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>TUBAL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>But Antonio is certainly undone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee</span><br/>
<span id='115'>me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I</span><br/>
<span id='116'>will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were</span><br/>
<span id='117'>he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I</span><br/>
<span id='118'>will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Henry V</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The English camp.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, ERPINGHAM, with all his host: SALISBURY and WESTMORELAND</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Where is the king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>The king himself is rode to view their battle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Of fighting men they have full three score thousand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>God be wi' you, princes all; I'll to my charge:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Then, joyfully, my noble Lord of Bedford,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>My dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And my kind kinsman, warriors all, adieu!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Farewell, good Salisbury; and good luck go with thee!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Farewell, kind lord; fight valiantly to-day:</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>For thou art framed of the firm truth of valour.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit SALISBURY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>He is full of valour as of kindness;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Princely in both.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the KING</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>                  O that we now had here</span><br/>
<span id='18'>But one ten thousand of those men in England</span><br/>
<span id='19'>That do no work to-day!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>What's he that wishes so?</span><br/>
<span id='21'>My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:</span><br/>
<span id='22'>If we are mark'd to die, we are enow</span><br/>
<span id='23'>To do our country loss; and if to live,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>The fewer men, the greater share of honour.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.</span><br/>
<span id='26'>By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>It yearns me not if men my garments wear;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Such outward things dwell not in my desires:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But if it be a sin to covet honour,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>I am the most offending soul alive.</span><br/>
<span id='32'>No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour</span><br/>
<span id='34'>As one man more, methinks, would share from me</span><br/>
<span id='35'>For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>That he which hath no stomach to this fight,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Let him depart; his passport shall be made</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And crowns for convoy put into his purse:</span><br/>
<span id='40'>We would not die in that man's company</span><br/>
<span id='41'>That fears his fellowship to die with us.</span><br/>
<span id='42'>This day is called the feast of Crispian:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And rouse him at the name of Crispian.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>He that shall live this day, and see old age,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>But he'll remember with advantages</span><br/>
<span id='53'>What feats he did that day: then shall our names.</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Familiar in his mouth as household words</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.</span><br/>
<span id='58'>This story shall the good man teach his son;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>From this day to the ending of the world,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>But we in it shall be remember'd;</span><br/>
<span id='62'>We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>For he to-day that sheds his blood with me</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>This day shall gentle his condition:</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And gentlemen in England now a-bed</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks</span><br/>
<span id='69'>That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter SALISBURY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>The French are bravely in their battles set,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And will with all expedience charge on us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>All things are ready, if our minds be so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Perish the man whose mind is backward now!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>WESTMORELAND</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>God's will! my liege, would you and I alone,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Without more help, could fight this royal battle!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Why, now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Which likes me better than to wish us one.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>You know your places: God be with you all!</span><br/>
<p><em>Tucket. Enter MONTJOY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MONTJOY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Once more I come to know of thee, King Harry,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Before thy most assured overthrow:</span><br/>
<span id='84'>For certainly thou art so near the gulf,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>The constable desires thee thou wilt mind</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Thy followers of repentance; that their souls</span><br/>
<span id='88'>May make a peaceful and a sweet retire</span><br/>
<span id='89'>From off these fields, where, wretches, their poor bodies</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Must lie and fester.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Who hath sent thee now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MONTJOY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>The Constable of France.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>I pray thee, bear my former answer back:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?</span><br/>
<span id='96'>The man that once did sell the lion's skin</span><br/>
<span id='97'>While the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>A many of our bodies shall no doubt</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Shall witness live in brass of this day's work:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>And those that leave their valiant bones in France,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>And draw their honours reeking up to heaven;</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Mark then abounding valour in our English,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>That being dead, like to the bullet's grazing,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Break out into a second course of mischief,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Killing in relapse of mortality.</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Let me speak proudly: tell the constable</span><br/>
<span id='112'>We are but warriors for the working-day;</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd</span><br/>
<span id='114'>With rainy marching in the painful field;</span><br/>
<span id='115'>There's not a piece of feather in our host&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Good argument, I hope, we will not fly&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>And time hath worn us into slovenry:</span><br/>
<span id='118'>But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night</span><br/>
<span id='120'>They'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck</span><br/>
<span id='121'>The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And turn them out of service. If they do this,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>As, if God please, they shall,&mdash;my ransom then</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald:</span><br/>
<span id='126'>They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Which if they have as I will leave 'em them,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Shall yield them little, tell the constable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MONTJOY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Thou never shalt hear herald any more.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>I fear thou'lt once more come again for ransom.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter YORK</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>My lord, most humbly on my knee I beg</span><br/>
<span id='133'>The leading of the vaward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Take it, brave York. Now, soldiers, march away:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

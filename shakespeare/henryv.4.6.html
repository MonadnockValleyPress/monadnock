<h1>Henry V</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene VI</h3>
<h4>Another part of the field.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Alarums. Enter KING HENRY and forces, EXETER, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Well have we done, thrice valiant countrymen:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>But all's not done; yet keep the French the field.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>The Duke of York commends him to your majesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Lives he, good uncle? thrice within this hour</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I saw him down; thrice up again and fighting;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>From helmet to the spur all blood he was.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep'd,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashes</span><br/>
<span id='14'>That bloodily did spawn upon his face;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And cries aloud 'Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!</span><br/>
<span id='16'>My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>As in this glorious and well-foughten field</span><br/>
<span id='19'>We kept together in our chivalry!'</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>And, with a feeble gripe, says 'Dear my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Commend my service to me sovereign.'</span><br/>
<span id='24'>So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck</span><br/>
<span id='25'>He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And so espoused to death, with blood he seal'd</span><br/>
<span id='27'>A testament of noble-ending love.</span><br/>
<span id='28'>The pretty and sweet manner of it forced</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>But I had not so much of man in me,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And all my mother came into mine eyes</span><br/>
<span id='32'>And gave me up to tears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>KING HENRY V</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>I blame you not;</span><br/>
<span id='34'>For, hearing this, I must perforce compound</span><br/>
<span id='35'>With mistful eyes, or they will issue too.</span><br/>
<p><em>Alarum</em></p>
<span id='36'>But, hark! what new alarum is this same?</span><br/>
<span id='37'>The French have reinforced their scatter'd men:</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Then every soldier kill his prisoners:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Give the word through.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

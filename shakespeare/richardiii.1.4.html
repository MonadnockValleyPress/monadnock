<h1>Richard III</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>London. The Tower.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BRAKENBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Why looks your grace so heavily today?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>O, I have pass'd a miserable night,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>That, as I am a Christian faithful man,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>I would not spend another such a night,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>So full of dismal terror was the time!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BRAKENBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Who from my cabin tempted me to walk</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>And cited up a thousand fearful times,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>During the wars of York and Lancaster</span><br/>
<span id='16'>That had befall'n us. As we paced along</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Into the tumbling billows of the main.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!</span><br/>
<span id='22'>What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!</span><br/>
<span id='23'>What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BRAKENBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Had you such leisure in the time of death</span><br/>
<span id='35'>To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Methought I had; and often did I strive</span><br/>
<span id='37'>To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth</span><br/>
<span id='39'>To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>But smother'd it within my panting bulk,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BRAKENBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Awaked you not with this sore agony?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;</span><br/>
<span id='44'>O, then began the tempest to my soul,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>With that grim ferryman which poets write of,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The first that there did greet my stranger soul,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by</span><br/>
<span id='53'>A shadow like an angel, with bright hair</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'</span><br/>
<span id='58'>With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Such hideous cries, that with the very noise</span><br/>
<span id='61'>I trembling waked, and for a season after</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Could not believe but that I was in hell,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Such terrible impression made the dream.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BRAKENBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>O Brakenbury, I have done those things,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Which now bear evidence against my soul,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!</span><br/>
<span id='69'>O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!</span><br/>
<span id='73'>I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BRAKENBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!</span><br/>
<p><em>CLARENCE sleeps</em></p>
<span id='76'>Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Princes have but their tides for their glories,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>An outward honour for an inward toil;</span><br/>
<span id='80'>And, for unfelt imagination,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>They often feel a world of restless cares:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>So that, betwixt their tides and low names,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>There's nothing differs but the outward fame.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter the two Murderers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Ho! who's here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BRAKENBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BRAKENBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Yea, are you so brief?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show</span><br/>
<span id='89'>him our commission; talk no more.</span><br/>
<p><em>BRAKENBURY reads it</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BRAKENBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>I am, in this, commanded to deliver</span><br/>
<span id='91'>The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>I will not reason what is meant hereby,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>I'll to the king; and signify to him</span><br/>
<span id='96'>That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='97'>Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit BRAKENBURY</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till</span><br/>
<span id='101'>the judgment-day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind</span><br/>
<span id='104'>of remorse in me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>What, art thou afraid?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be</span><br/>
<span id='107'>damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>I thought thou hadst been resolute.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>So I am, to let him live.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour</span><br/>
<span id='112'>will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one</span><br/>
<span id='113'>would tell twenty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>How dost thou feel thyself now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet</span><br/>
<span id='116'>within me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>Remember our reward, when the deed is done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>Where is thy conscience now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>thy conscience flies out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>How if it come to thee again?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it</span><br/>
<span id='126'>makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it</span><br/>
<span id='127'>accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;</span><br/>
<span id='128'>he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it</span><br/>
<span id='129'>detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that</span><br/>
<span id='130'>mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of</span><br/>
<span id='131'>obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold</span><br/>
<span id='132'>that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it</span><br/>
<span id='133'>is turned out of all towns and cities for a</span><br/>
<span id='134'>dangerous thing; and every man that means to live</span><br/>
<span id='135'>well endeavours to trust to himself and to live</span><br/>
<span id='136'>without it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me</span><br/>
<span id='138'>not to kill the duke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he</span><br/>
<span id='140'>would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>I warrant thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his</span><br/>
<span id='144'>reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy</span><br/>
<span id='146'>sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt</span><br/>
<span id='147'>in the next room.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>O excellent devise! make a sop of him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>No, first let's reason with him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>Second murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>In God's name, what art thou?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>A man, as you are.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>But not, as I am, royal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Nor you, as we are, loyal.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>Both</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>To, to, to&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>To murder me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>Both</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='164'>Ay, ay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='168'>Offended us you have not, but the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>I shall be reconciled to him again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='171'>Are you call'd forth from out a world of men</span><br/>
<span id='172'>To slay the innocent? What is my offence?</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Where are the evidence that do accuse me?</span><br/>
<span id='174'>What lawful quest have given their verdict up</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced</span><br/>
<span id='176'>The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Before I be convict by course of law,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>To threaten me with death is most unlawful.</span><br/>
<span id='179'>I charge you, as you hope to have redemption</span><br/>
<span id='180'>By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>That you depart and lay no hands on me</span><br/>
<span id='182'>The deed you undertake is damnable.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>What we will do, we do upon command.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>And he that hath commanded is the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='185'>Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Hath in the tables of his law commanded</span><br/>
<span id='187'>That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?</span><br/>
<span id='189'>Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,</span><br/>
<span id='190'>To hurl upon their heads that break his law.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>For false forswearing and for murder too:</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,</span><br/>
<span id='194'>To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>And, like a traitor to the name of God,</span><br/>
<span id='196'>Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='198'>Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='199'>How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='201'>Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?</span><br/>
<span id='202'>For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,</span><br/>
<span id='203'>He sends ye not to murder me for this</span><br/>
<span id='204'>For in this sin he is as deep as I.</span><br/>
<span id='205'>If God will be revenged for this deed.</span><br/>
<span id='206'>O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;</span><br/>
<span id='208'>He needs no indirect nor lawless course</span><br/>
<span id='209'>To cut off those that have offended him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='210'>Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,</span><br/>
<span id='211'>When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,</span><br/>
<span id='212'>That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='213'>My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='214'>Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,</span><br/>
<span id='215'>Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;</span><br/>
<span id='217'>I am his brother, and I love him well.</span><br/>
<span id='218'>If you be hired for meed, go back again,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,</span><br/>
<span id='220'>Who shall reward you better for my life</span><br/>
<span id='221'>Than Edward will for tidings of my death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='222'>You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='223'>O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:</span><br/>
<span id='224'>Go you to him from me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>Both</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='225'>Ay, so we will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='226'>Tell him, when that our princely father York</span><br/>
<span id='227'>Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,</span><br/>
<span id='228'>And charged us from his soul to love each other,</span><br/>
<span id='229'>He little thought of this divided friendship:</span><br/>
<span id='230'>Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='231'>Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='232'>O, do not slander him, for he is kind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='233'>Right,</span><br/>
<span id='234'>As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:</span><br/>
<span id='235'>'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='236'>It cannot be; for when I parted with him,</span><br/>
<span id='237'>He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,</span><br/>
<span id='238'>That he would labour my delivery.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>Second Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='239'>Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee</span><br/>
<span id='240'>From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='241'>Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>

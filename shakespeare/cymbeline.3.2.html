<h4>Britain. Another room in the palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter PISANIO, with a letter</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not</span><br/>
<span id='2'>What monster's her accuser? Leonatus,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>O master! what a strange infection</span><br/>
<span id='4'>Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'd</span><br/>
<span id='6'>On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:</span><br/>
<span id='7'>She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults</span><br/>
<span id='9'>As would take in some virtue. O my master!</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Thy mind to her is now as low as were</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Upon the love and truth and vows which I</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?</span><br/>
<span id='14'>If it be so to do good service, never</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>That I should seem to lack humanity</span><br/>
<span id='17'>so much as this fact comes to?</span><br/>
<p><em>Reading</em></p>
<span id='18'>'Do't: the letter</span><br/>
<span id='19'>that I have sent her, by her own command</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st</span><br/>
<span id='23'>So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.</span><br/>
<span id='24'>I am ignorant in what I am commanded.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter IMOGEN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>How now, Pisanio!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Madam, here is a letter from my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!</span><br/>
<span id='28'>O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer</span><br/>
<span id='29'>That knew the stars as I his characters;</span><br/>
<span id='30'>He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Let what is here contain'd relish of love,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Of my lord's health, of his content, yet not</span><br/>
<span id='33'>That we two are asunder; let that grieve him:</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>For it doth physic love: of his content,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be</span><br/>
<span id='37'>You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet</span><br/>
<span id='40'>You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!</span><br/>
<p><em>Reads</em></p>
<span id='41'>'Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take me</span><br/>
<span id='42'>in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me, as</span><br/>
<span id='43'>you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew me</span><br/>
<span id='44'>with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>at Milford-Haven: what your own love will out of</span><br/>
<span id='46'>this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all</span><br/>
<span id='47'>happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>increasing in love,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'</span><br/>
<span id='50'>O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?</span><br/>
<span id='51'>He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me</span><br/>
<span id='52'>How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs</span><br/>
<span id='53'>May plod it in a week, why may not I</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Let me bate,&mdash;but not like me&mdash;yet long'st,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>But in a fainter kind:&mdash;O, not like me;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>For mine's beyond beyond&mdash;say, and speak thick;</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>To the smothering of the sense&mdash;how far it is</span><br/>
<span id='61'>To this same blessed Milford: and by the way</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Tell me how Wales was made so happy as</span><br/>
<span id='63'>To inherit such a haven: but first of all,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>How we may steal from hence, and for the gap</span><br/>
<span id='65'>That we shall make in time, from our hence-going</span><br/>
<span id='66'>And our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?</span><br/>
<span id='68'>We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>How many score of miles may we well ride</span><br/>
<span id='70'>'Twixt hour and hour?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>One score 'twixt sun and sun,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Madam, 's enough for you:</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside</em></p>
<span id='73'>and too much too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Why, one that rode to's execution, man,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Could never go so slow: I have heard of</span><br/>
<span id='76'>riding wagers,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Where horses have been nimbler than the sands</span><br/>
<span id='78'>That run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery:</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say</span><br/>
<span id='80'>She'll home to her father: and provide me presently</span><br/>
<span id='81'>A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit</span><br/>
<span id='82'>A franklin's housewife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PISANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>Madam, you're best consider.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>IMOGEN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>I see before me, man: nor here, nor here,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Accessible is none but Milford way.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h3>LXXXIV</h3>
<p>
Who is it that says most, which can say more,<br/>
Than this rich praise,&#151;that you alone, are you?<br/>
In whose confine immured is the store<br/>
Which should example where your equal grew.<br/>
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell<br/>
That to his subject lends not some small glory;<br/>
But he that writes of you, if he can tell<br/>
That you are you, so dignifies his story,<br/>
Let him but copy what in you is writ,<br/>
Not making worse what nature made so clear,<br/>
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,<br/>
Making his style admired every where.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.<br/>

<h1>Henry VI, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene II</h3>
<h4>London. York's garden.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Our simple supper ended, give me leave</span><br/>
<span id='3'>In this close walk to satisfy myself,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>In craving your opinion of my title,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Which is infallible, to England's crown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>My lord, I long to hear it at full.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>The Nevils are thy subjects to command.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Then thus:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;</span><br/>
<span id='15'>The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>William of Windsor was the seventh and last.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Edward the Black Prince died before his father</span><br/>
<span id='19'>And left behind him Richard, his only son,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king;</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Father, the duke hath told the truth:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>Which now they hold by force and not by right;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>The issue of the next son should have reign'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>But William of Hatfield died without an heir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line</span><br/>
<span id='35'>I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Who kept him in captivity till he died.</span><br/>
<span id='43'>But to the rest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>       His eldest sister, Anne,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>My mother, being heir unto the crown</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Married Richard Earl of Cambridge; who was son</span><br/>
<span id='47'>To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir</span><br/>
<span id='49'>To Roger Earl of March, who was the son</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:</span><br/>
<span id='52'>So, if the issue of the elder son</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Succeed before the younger, I am king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>What plain proceeding is more plain than this?</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,</span><br/>
<span id='56'>The fourth son; York claims it from the third.</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee</span><br/>
<span id='59'>And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And in this private plot be we the first</span><br/>
<span id='62'>That shall salute our rightful sovereign</span><br/>
<span id='63'>With honour of his birthright to the crown.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BOTH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>We thank you, lords. But I am not your king</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd</span><br/>
<span id='67'>With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>But with advice and silent secrecy.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Do you as I do in these dangerous days:</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>At Buckingham and all the crew of them,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:</span><br/>
<span id='76'>'Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SALISBURY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>WARWICK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>YORK</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>And, Nevil, this I do assure myself:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick</span><br/>
<span id='83'>The greatest man in England but the king.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

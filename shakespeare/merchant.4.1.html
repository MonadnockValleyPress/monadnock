<h1>The Merchant of Venice</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Venice. A court of justice.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter the DUKE, the Magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO, GRATIANO, SALERIO, and others</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>What, is Antonio here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Ready, so please your grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer</span><br/>
<span id='4'>A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch</span><br/>
<span id='5'>uncapable of pity, void and empty</span><br/>
<span id='6'>From any dram of mercy.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>I have heard</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify</span><br/>
<span id='9'>His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate</span><br/>
<span id='10'>And that no lawful means can carry me</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose</span><br/>
<span id='12'>My patience to his fury, and am arm'd</span><br/>
<span id='13'>To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>The very tyranny and rage of his.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Go one, and call the Jew into the court.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SALERIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SHYLOCK</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Make room, and let him stand before our face.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice</span><br/>
<span id='20'>To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And where thou now exact'st the penalty,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Forgive a moiety of the principal;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,</span><br/>
<span id='29'>That have of late so huddled on his back,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Enow to press a royal merchant down</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And pluck commiseration of his state</span><br/>
<span id='32'>From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd</span><br/>
<span id='34'>To offices of tender courtesy.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn</span><br/>
<span id='38'>To have the due and forfeit of my bond:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>If you deny it, let the danger light</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Upon your charter and your city's freedom.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have</span><br/>
<span id='42'>A weight of carrion flesh than to receive</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?</span><br/>
<span id='45'>What if my house be troubled with a rat</span><br/>
<span id='46'>And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats</span><br/>
<span id='47'>To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Some men there are love not a gaping pig;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Cannot contain their urine: for affection,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:</span><br/>
<span id='54'>As there is no firm reason to be render'd,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Why he, a harmless necessary cat;</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Must yield to such inevitable shame</span><br/>
<span id='59'>As to offend, himself being offended;</span><br/>
<span id='60'>So can I give no reason, nor I will not,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing</span><br/>
<span id='62'>I bear Antonio, that I follow thus</span><br/>
<span id='63'>A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>To excuse the current of thy cruelty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>I am not bound to please thee with my answers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Do all men kill the things they do not love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>Hates any man the thing he would not kill?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Every offence is not a hate at first.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>I pray you, think you question with the Jew:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>You may as well go stand upon the beach</span><br/>
<span id='73'>And bid the main flood bate his usual height;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>You may as well use question with the wolf</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>You may as well forbid the mountain pines</span><br/>
<span id='77'>To wag their high tops and to make no noise,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;</span><br/>
<span id='79'>You may as well do anything most hard,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>As seek to soften that&mdash;than which what's harder?&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Make no more offers, use no farther means,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>But with all brief and plain conveniency</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>For thy three thousand ducats here is six.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>What judgment shall I dread, doing</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Were in six parts and every part a ducat,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>I would not draw them; I would have my bond.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?</span><br/>
<span id='91'>You have among you many a purchased slave,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>You use in abject and in slavish parts,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Because you bought them: shall I say to you,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Be made as soft as yours and let their palates</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Be season'd with such viands? You will answer</span><br/>
<span id='99'>'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>If you deny me, fie upon your law!</span><br/>
<span id='103'>There is no force in the decrees of Venice.</span><br/>
<span id='104'>I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>Upon my power I may dismiss this court,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Whom I have sent for to determine this,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Come here to-day.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SALERIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>                  My lord, here stays without</span><br/>
<span id='110'>A messenger with letters from the doctor,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>New come from Padua.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Bring us the letter; call the messenger.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!</span><br/>
<span id='114'>The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='116'>I am a tainted wether of the flock,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me</span><br/>
<span id='119'>You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Than to live still and write mine epitaph.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>Came you from Padua, from Bellario?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.</span><br/>
<p><em>Presenting a letter</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>GRATIANO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And for thy life let justice be accused.</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Thou almost makest me waver in my faith</span><br/>
<span id='133'>To hold opinion with Pythagoras,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>That souls of animals infuse themselves</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Infused itself in thee; for thy desires</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall</span><br/>
<span id='144'>To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>This letter from Bellario doth commend</span><br/>
<span id='146'>A young and learned doctor to our court.</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Where is he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>NERISSA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>                  He attendeth here hard by,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>With all my heart. Some three or four of you</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Go give him courteous conduct to this place.</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>Clerk</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>[Reads]</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of</span><br/>
<span id='155'>your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that</span><br/>
<span id='156'>your messenger came, in loving visitation was with</span><br/>
<span id='157'>me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I</span><br/>
<span id='158'>acquainted him with the cause in controversy between</span><br/>
<span id='159'>the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er</span><br/>
<span id='160'>many books together: he is furnished with my</span><br/>
<span id='161'>opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the</span><br/>
<span id='162'>greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes</span><br/>
<span id='163'>with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's</span><br/>
<span id='164'>request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of</span><br/>
<span id='165'>years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend</span><br/>
<span id='166'>estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so</span><br/>
<span id='167'>old a head. I leave him to your gracious</span><br/>
<span id='168'>acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his</span><br/>
<span id='169'>commendation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:</span><br/>
<span id='171'>And here, I take it, is the doctor come.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws</em></p>
<span id='172'>Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>I did, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='174'>                  You are welcome: take your place.</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Are you acquainted with the difference</span><br/>
<span id='176'>That holds this present question in the court?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>I am informed thoroughly of the cause.</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>DUKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='179'>Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Is your name Shylock?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='181'>Shylock is my name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;</span><br/>
<span id='183'>Yet in such rule that the Venetian law</span><br/>
<span id='184'>Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.</span><br/>
<span id='185'>You stand within his danger, do you not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='186'>Ay, so he says.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='187'>                  Do you confess the bond?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='188'>I do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>    Then must the Jew be merciful.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>On what compulsion must I? tell me that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='191'>The quality of mercy is not strain'd,</span><br/>
<span id='192'>It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven</span><br/>
<span id='193'>Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;</span><br/>
<span id='194'>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:</span><br/>
<span id='195'>'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes</span><br/>
<span id='196'>The throned monarch better than his crown;</span><br/>
<span id='197'>His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,</span><br/>
<span id='198'>The attribute to awe and majesty,</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;</span><br/>
<span id='200'>But mercy is above this sceptred sway;</span><br/>
<span id='201'>It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,</span><br/>
<span id='202'>It is an attribute to God himself;</span><br/>
<span id='203'>And earthly power doth then show likest God's</span><br/>
<span id='204'>When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,</span><br/>
<span id='205'>Though justice be thy plea, consider this,</span><br/>
<span id='206'>That, in the course of justice, none of us</span><br/>
<span id='207'>Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;</span><br/>
<span id='208'>And that same prayer doth teach us all to render</span><br/>
<span id='209'>The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much</span><br/>
<span id='210'>To mitigate the justice of thy plea;</span><br/>
<span id='211'>Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice</span><br/>
<span id='212'>Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='213'>My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,</span><br/>
<span id='214'>The penalty and forfeit of my bond.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='215'>Is he not able to discharge the money?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>BASSANIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='216'>Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;</span><br/>
<span id='217'>Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,</span><br/>
<span id='218'>I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,</span><br/>
<span id='219'>On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:</span><br/>
<span id='220'>If this will not suffice, it must appear</span><br/>
<span id='221'>That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,</span><br/>
<span id='222'>Wrest once the law to your authority:</span><br/>
<span id='223'>To do a great right, do a little wrong,</span><br/>
<span id='224'>And curb this cruel devil of his will.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='225'>It must not be; there is no power in Venice</span><br/>
<span id='226'>Can alter a decree established:</span><br/>
<span id='227'>'Twill be recorded for a precedent,</span><br/>
<span id='228'>And many an error by the same example</span><br/>
<span id='229'>Will rush into the state: it cannot be.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='230'>A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!</span><br/>
<span id='231'>O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='232'>I pray you, let me look upon the bond.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='233'>Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='234'>Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='235'>An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:</span><br/>
<span id='236'>Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?</span><br/>
<span id='237'>No, not for Venice.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='238'>Why, this bond is forfeit;</span><br/>
<span id='239'>And lawfully by this the Jew may claim</span><br/>
<span id='240'>A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off</span><br/>
<span id='241'>Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:</span><br/>
<span id='242'>Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='243'>When it is paid according to the tenor.</span><br/>
<span id='244'>It doth appear you are a worthy judge;</span><br/>
<span id='245'>You know the law, your exposition</span><br/>
<span id='246'>Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,</span><br/>
<span id='247'>Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,</span><br/>
<span id='248'>Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear</span><br/>
<span id='249'>There is no power in the tongue of man</span><br/>
<span id='250'>To alter me: I stay here on my bond.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='251'>Most heartily I do beseech the court</span><br/>
<span id='252'>To give the judgment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='253'>Why then, thus it is:</span><br/>
<span id='254'>You must prepare your bosom for his knife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='255'>O noble judge! O excellent young man!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='256'>For the intent and purpose of the law</span><br/>
<span id='257'>Hath full relation to the penalty,</span><br/>
<span id='258'>Which here appeareth due upon the bond.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='259'>'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!</span><br/>
<span id='260'>How much more elder art thou than thy looks!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>PORTIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='261'>Therefore lay bare your bosom.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>SHYLOCK</strong></a>

<h1>Taming of the Shrew</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene II</h3>
<h4>Padua. Before Baptista's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, TRANIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA, LUCENTIO, and others, attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>[To TRANIO]  Signior Lucentio, this is the</span><br/>
<span id='2'>'pointed day.</span><br/>
<span id='3'>That Katharina and Petruchio should be married,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.</span><br/>
<span id='5'>What will be said? what mockery will it be,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>To want the bridegroom when the priest attends</span><br/>
<span id='7'>To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!</span><br/>
<span id='8'>What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced</span><br/>
<span id='10'>To give my hand opposed against my heart</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.</span><br/>
<span id='13'>I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And, to be noted for a merry man,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Now must the world point at poor Katharina,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>If it would please him come and marry her!'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Whatever fortune stays him from his word:</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Would Katharina had never seen him though!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit weeping, followed by BIANCA and others</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>Go, girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>For such an injury would vex a very saint,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BIONDELLO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Master, master! news, old news, and such news as</span><br/>
<span id='32'>you never heard of!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Is it new and old too? how may that be?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Is he come?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Why, no, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>What then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>He is coming.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>When will he be here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>When he stands where I am and sees you there.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>But say, what to thine old news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old</span><br/>
<span id='43'>jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair</span><br/>
<span id='44'>of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the</span><br/>
<span id='46'>town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>with two broken points: his horse hipped with an</span><br/>
<span id='48'>old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose</span><br/>
<span id='50'>in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected</span><br/>
<span id='51'>with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with</span><br/>
<span id='52'>spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the</span><br/>
<span id='54'>bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;</span><br/>
<span id='55'>near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit</span><br/>
<span id='56'>and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being</span><br/>
<span id='57'>restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been</span><br/>
<span id='58'>often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth</span><br/>
<span id='59'>six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>which hath two letters for her name fairly set down</span><br/>
<span id='61'>in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Who comes with him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned</span><br/>
<span id='64'>like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a</span><br/>
<span id='65'>kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red</span><br/>
<span id='66'>and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty</span><br/>
<span id='67'>fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a</span><br/>
<span id='68'>very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian</span><br/>
<span id='69'>footboy or a gentleman's lackey.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Why, sir, he comes not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Didst thou not say he comes?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Who? that Petruchio came?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>Ay, that Petruchio came.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Why, that's all one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>   Nay, by Saint Jamy,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>I hold you a penny,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>A horse and a man</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Is more than one,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>And yet not many.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>You are welcome, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>And yet I come not well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>And yet you halt not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Not so well apparell'd</span><br/>
<span id='89'>As I wish you were.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Were it better, I should rush in thus.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?</span><br/>
<span id='92'>How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>And wherefore gaze this goodly company,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>As if they saw some wondrous monument,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Some comet or unusual prodigy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>First were we sad, fearing you would not come;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>An eye-sore to our solemn festival!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>And tells us, what occasion of import</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>And sent you hither so unlike yourself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Though in some part enforced to digress;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse</span><br/>
<span id='108'>As you shall well be satisfied withal.</span><br/>
<span id='109'>But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:</span><br/>
<span id='110'>The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>See not your bride in these unreverent robes:</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:</span><br/>
<span id='116'>To me she's married, not unto my clothes:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Could I repair what she will wear in me,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>As I can change these poor accoutrements,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>But what a fool am I to chat with you,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>When I should bid good morrow to my bride,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And seal the title with a lovely kiss!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>He hath some meaning in his mad attire:</span><br/>
<span id='124'>We will persuade him, be it possible,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>To put on better ere he go to church.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>I'll after him, and see the event of this.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and attendants</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>But to her love concerneth us to add</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>As I before unparted to your worship,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>I am to get a man,&mdash;whate'er he be,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;</span><br/>
<span id='133'>And make assurance here in Padua</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Of greater sums than I have promised.</span><br/>
<span id='135'>So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>And marry sweet Bianca with consent.</span><br/>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>

<span id='137'>Were it not that my fellow-school-master</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,</span><br/>

<span id='speech52'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!</span><br/>
<span id='157'>I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;</span><br/>
<span id='161'>And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff</span><br/>
<span id='163'>That down fell priest and book and book and priest:</span><br/>
<span id='164'>'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>What said the wench when he rose again?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>As if the vicar meant to cozen him.</span><br/>
<span id='168'>But after many ceremonies done,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if</span><br/>
<span id='170'>He had been aboard, carousing to his mates</span><br/>
<span id='171'>After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Having no other reason</span><br/>
<span id='174'>But that his beard grew thin and hungerly</span><br/>
<span id='175'>And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.</span><br/>
<span id='176'>This done, he took the bride about the neck</span><br/>
<span id='177'>And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack</span><br/>
<span id='178'>That at the parting all the church did echo:</span><br/>
<span id='179'>And I seeing this came thence for very shame;</span><br/>
<span id='180'>And after me, I know, the rout is coming.</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Such a mad marriage never was before:</span><br/>

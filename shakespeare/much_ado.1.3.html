<h1>Much Ado About Nothing</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene III</h3>
<h4>The same.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter DON JOHN and CONRADE</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out</span><br/>
<span id='2'>of measure sad?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;</span><br/>
<span id='4'>therefore the sadness is without limit.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>You should hear reason.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>If not a present remedy, at least a patient</span><br/>
<span id='8'>sufferance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral</span><br/>
<span id='11'>medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide</span><br/>
<span id='12'>what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile</span><br/>
<span id='13'>at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait</span><br/>
<span id='14'>for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and</span><br/>
<span id='15'>tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and</span><br/>
<span id='16'>claw no man in his humour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Yea, but you must not make the full show of this</span><br/>
<span id='18'>till you may do it without controlment. You have of</span><br/>
<span id='19'>late stood out against your brother, and he hath</span><br/>
<span id='20'>ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is</span><br/>
<span id='21'>impossible you should take true root but by the</span><br/>
<span id='22'>fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful</span><br/>
<span id='23'>that you frame the season for your own harvest.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in</span><br/>
<span id='25'>his grace, and it better fits my blood to be</span><br/>
<span id='26'>disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob</span><br/>
<span id='27'>love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to</span><br/>
<span id='28'>be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied</span><br/>
<span id='29'>but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with</span><br/>
<span id='30'>a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I</span><br/>
<span id='31'>have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my</span><br/>
<span id='32'>mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do</span><br/>
<span id='33'>my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and</span><br/>
<span id='34'>seek not to alter me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Can you make no use of your discontent?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>I make all use of it, for I use it only.</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Who comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BORACHIO</em></p>
<span id='38'>What news, Borachio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your</span><br/>
<span id='40'>brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I</span><br/>
<span id='41'>can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?</span><br/>
<span id='43'>What is he for a fool that betroths himself to</span><br/>
<span id='44'>unquietness?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Marry, it is your brother's right hand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Who? the most exquisite Claudio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Even he.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks</span><br/>
<span id='49'>he?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a</span><br/>
<span id='53'>musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand</span><br/>
<span id='54'>in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the</span><br/>
<span id='55'>arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the</span><br/>
<span id='56'>prince should woo Hero for himself, and having</span><br/>
<span id='57'>obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to</span><br/>
<span id='59'>my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the</span><br/>
<span id='60'>glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I</span><br/>
<span id='61'>bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CONRADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>To the death, my lord.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DON JOHN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the</span><br/>
<span id='64'>greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of</span><br/>
<span id='65'>my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BORACHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>We'll wait upon your lordship.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

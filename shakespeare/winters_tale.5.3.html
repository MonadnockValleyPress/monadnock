<h1>Winter's Tale</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene III</h3>
<h4>A chapel in Paulina's house.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA, CAMILLO, PAULINA, Lords, and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort</span><br/>
<span id='2'>That I have had of thee!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>What, sovereign sir,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>I did not well I meant well. All my services</span><br/>
<span id='5'>You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>With your crown'd brother and these your contracted</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>It is a surplus of your grace, which never</span><br/>
<span id='9'>My life may last to answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>O Paulina,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>We honour you with trouble: but we came</span><br/>
<span id='12'>To see the statue of our queen: your gallery</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Have we pass'd through, not without much content</span><br/>
<span id='14'>In many singularities; but we saw not</span><br/>
<span id='15'>That which my daughter came to look upon,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>The statue of her mother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>As she lived peerless,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>So her dead likeness, I do well believe,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Excels whatever yet you look'd upon</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare</span><br/>
<span id='22'>To see the life as lively mock'd as ever</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.</span><br/>
<p><em>PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue</em></p>
<span id='24'>I like your silence, it the more shows off</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Comes it not something near?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Her natural posture!</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she</span><br/>
<span id='30'>In thy not chiding, for she was as tender</span><br/>
<span id='31'>As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing</span><br/>
<span id='33'>So aged as this seems.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>O, not by much.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>So much the more our carver's excellence;</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her</span><br/>
<span id='37'>As she lived now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>                  As now she might have done,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>So much to my good comfort, as it is</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Even with such life of majesty, warm life,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!</span><br/>
<span id='43'>I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me</span><br/>
<span id='44'>For being more stone than it? O royal piece,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>There's magic in thy majesty, which has</span><br/>
<span id='46'>My evils conjured to remembrance and</span><br/>
<span id='47'>From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Standing like stone with thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PERDITA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>And give me leave,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>And do not say 'tis superstition, that</span><br/>
<span id='51'>I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Dear queen, that ended when I but began,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Give me that hand of yours to kiss.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>O, patience!</span><br/>
<span id='55'>The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's not dry.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>CAMILLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>So many summers dry; scarce any joy</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Did ever so long live; no sorrow</span><br/>
<span id='60'>But kill'd itself much sooner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Dear my brother,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>Let him that was the cause of this have power</span><br/>
<span id='63'>To take off so much grief from you as he</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Will piece up in himself.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Indeed, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>If I had thought the sight of my poor image</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Would thus have wrought you,&mdash;for the stone is mine&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='68'>I'ld not have show'd it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Do not draw the curtain.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy</span><br/>
<span id='71'>May think anon it moves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Let be, let be.</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='74'>What was he that did make it? See, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Did verily bear blood?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Masterly done:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>The very life seems warm upon her lip.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>The fixture of her eye has motion in't,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>As we are mock'd with art.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>I'll draw the curtain:</span><br/>
<span id='82'>My lord's almost so far transported that</span><br/>
<span id='83'>He'll think anon it lives.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>O sweet Paulina,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Make me to think so twenty years together!</span><br/>
<span id='86'>No settled senses of the world can match</span><br/>
<span id='87'>The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but</span><br/>
<span id='89'>I could afflict you farther.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Do, Paulina;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>For this affliction has a taste as sweet</span><br/>
<span id='92'>As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>For I will kiss her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>Good my lord, forbear:</span><br/>
<span id='97'>The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own</span><br/>
<span id='99'>With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>No, not these twenty years.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PERDITA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>So long could I</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Stand by, a looker on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Either forbear,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you</span><br/>
<span id='105'>For more amazement. If you can behold it,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>I'll make the statue move indeed, descend</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And take you by the hand; but then you'll think&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Which I protest against&mdash;I am assisted</span><br/>
<span id='109'>By wicked powers.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>                  What you can make her do,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>I am content to look on: what to speak,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy</span><br/>
<span id='113'>To make her speak as move.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>It is required</span><br/>
<span id='115'>You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>On: those that think it is unlawful business</span><br/>
<span id='117'>I am about, let them depart.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Proceed:</span><br/>
<span id='119'>No foot shall stir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Music, awake her; strike!</span><br/>
<p><em>Music</em></p>
<span id='121'>'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:</span><br/>
<p><em>HERMIONE comes down</em></p>
<span id='126'>Start not; her actions shall be holy as</span><br/>
<span id='127'>You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Until you see her die again; for then</span><br/>
<span id='129'>You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>When she was young you woo'd her; now in age</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Is she become the suitor?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>O, she's warm!</span><br/>
<span id='133'>If this be magic, let it be an art</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Lawful as eating.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>                  She embraces him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CAMILLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>She hangs about his neck:</span><br/>
<span id='137'>If she pertain to life let her speak too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>POLIXENES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Or how stolen from the dead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>That she is living,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Were it but told you, should be hooted at</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel</span><br/>
<span id='145'>And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Our Perdita is found.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>HERMIONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>You gods, look down</span><br/>
<span id='148'>And from your sacred vials pour your graces</span><br/>
<span id='149'>Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Knowing by Paulina that the oracle</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Myself to see the issue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>PAULINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>There's time enough for that;</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Lest they desire upon this push to trouble</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Your joys with like relation. Go together,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>You precious winners all; your exultation</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there</span><br/>
<span id='161'>My mate, that's never to be found again,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Lament till I am lost.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LEONTES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='163'>O, peace, Paulina!</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>As I by thine a wife: this is a match,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;</span><br/>
<span id='167'>But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many</span><br/>
<span id='169'>A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='170'>For him, I partly know his mind&mdash;to find thee</span><br/>
<span id='171'>An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Is richly noted and here justified</span><br/>
<span id='174'>By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.</span><br/>
<span id='175'>What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>That e'er I put between your holy looks</span><br/>
<span id='177'>My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Each one demand an answer to his part</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first</span><br/>
<span id='183'>We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Once more we sit in England's royal throne,<br/>
<span id='2'>Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.<br/>
<span id='3'>What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,<br/>
<span id='4'>Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!<br/>
<span id='5'>Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd<br/>
<span id='6'>For hardy and undoubted champions;<br/>
<span id='7'>Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,<br/>
<span id='8'>And two Northumberlands; two braver men<br/>
<span id='9'>Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;<br/>
<span id='10'>With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,<br/>
<span id='11'>That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion<br/>
<span id='12'>And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.<br/>
<span id='13'>Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat<br/>
<span id='14'>And made our footstool of security.<br/>
<span id='15'>Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.<br/>
<span id='16'>Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself<br/>
<span id='17'>Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,<br/>
<span id='18'>Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,<br/>
<span id='19'>That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;<br/>
<span id='20'>And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote><em>[Aside]</em>  I'll blast his harvest, if your head were laid;<br/>
<span id='22'>For yet I am not look'd on in the world.<br/>
<span id='23'>This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave;<br/>
<span id='24'>And heave it shall some weight, or break my back:<br/>
<span id='25'>Work thou the way,&mdash;and thou shalt execute.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;<br/>
<span id='27'>And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>The duty that I owe unto your majesty<br/>
<span id='29'>I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>QUEEN ELIZABETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,<br/>
<span id='32'>Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.<br/>
 <em>[Aside]</em>  To say the truth, so Judas kiss'd his master,<br/>
<span id='34'>And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Now am I seated as my soul delights,<br/>
Having <span id='36'>my country's peace and brothers' loves.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CLARENCE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>What will your grace have done with Margaret?<br/>
Reignier, her father, to the king of France<br/>
<span id='39'>Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,<br/>
<span id='40'>And hither have they sent it for her ransom.<br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>KING EDWARD IV</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Away with her, and waft her hence to France.<br/>
<span id='42'>And now what rests but that we spend the time<br/>
<span id='43'>With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,<br/>
<span id='44'>Such as befits the pleasure of the court?<br/>
<span id='45'>Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!<br/>
<span id='46'>For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.<br/>

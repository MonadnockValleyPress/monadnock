<h1>Henry VI, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene X</h3>
<h4>Kent. Iden's garden.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter CADE</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Fie on ambition! fie on myself, that have a sword,</span><br/>
<span id='2'>and yet am ready to famish! These five days have I</span><br/>
<span id='3'>hid me in these woods and durst not peep out, for</span><br/>
<span id='4'>all the country is laid for me; but now am I so</span><br/>
<span id='5'>hungry that if I might have a lease of my life for a</span><br/>
<span id='6'>thousand years I could stay no longer. Wherefore,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden, to</span><br/>
<span id='8'>see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another</span><br/>
<span id='9'>while, which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach</span><br/>
<span id='10'>this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'</span><br/>
<span id='11'>was born to do me good: for many a time, but for a</span><br/>
<span id='12'>sallet, my brainpan had been cleft with a brown</span><br/>
<span id='13'>bill; and many a time, when I have been dry and</span><br/>
<span id='14'>bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a</span><br/>
<span id='15'>quart pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'</span><br/>
<span id='16'>must serve me to feed on.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter IDEN</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>IDEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?</span><br/>
<span id='19'>This small inheritance my father left me</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.</span><br/>
<span id='21'>I seek not to wax great by others' waning,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Or gather wealth, I care not, with what envy:</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Sufficeth that I have maintains my state</span><br/>
<span id='24'>And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a</span><br/>
<span id='26'>stray, for entering his fee-simple without leave.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>Ah, villain, thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand</span><br/>
<span id='28'>crowns of the king carrying my head to him: but</span><br/>
<span id='29'>I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallow</span><br/>
<span id='30'>my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>IDEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,</span><br/>
<span id='32'>I know thee not; why, then, should I betray thee?</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Is't not enough to break into my garden,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Brave thee! ay, by the best blood that ever was</span><br/>
<span id='38'>broached, and beard thee too. Look on me well: I</span><br/>
<span id='39'>have eat no meat these five days; yet, come thou and</span><br/>
<span id='40'>thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as dead</span><br/>
<span id='41'>as a doornail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>IDEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man.</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>See if thou canst outface me with thy looks:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And if mine arm be heaved in the air,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>As for words, whose greatness answers words,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Let this my sword report what speech forbears.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I</span><br/>
<span id='56'>heard! Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out</span><br/>
<span id='57'>the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou</span><br/>
<span id='58'>sleep in thy sheath, I beseech God on my knees thou</span><br/>
<span id='59'>mayst be turned to hobnails.</span><br/>
<p><em>Here they fight. CADE falls</em></p>
<span id='60'>O, I am slain! famine and no other hath slain me:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me</span><br/>
<span id='62'>but the ten meals I have lost, and I'll defy them</span><br/>
<span id='63'>all. Wither, garden; and be henceforth a</span><br/>
<span id='64'>burying-place to all that do dwell in this house,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>IDEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Sword, I will hollow thee for this thy deed,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead:</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point;</span><br/>
<span id='70'>But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>To emblaze the honour that thy master got.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CADE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory. Tell</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Kent from me, she hath lost her best man, and exhort</span><br/>
<span id='74'>all the world to be cowards; for I, that never</span><br/>
<span id='75'>feared any, am vanquished by famine, not by valour.</span><br/>
<p><em>Dies</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>IDEN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare thee;</span><br/>
<span id='78'>And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell.</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>And there cut off thy most ungracious head;</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Which I will bear in triumph to the king,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

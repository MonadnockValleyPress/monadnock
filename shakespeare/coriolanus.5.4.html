<h1>Coriolanus</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>Rome. A public place.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond</span><br/>
<span id='2'>corner-stone?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Why, what of that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>If it be possible for you to displace it with your</span><br/>
<span id='5'>little finger, there is some hope the ladies of</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.</span><br/>
<span id='7'>But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are</span><br/>
<span id='8'>sentenced and stay upon execution.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Is't possible that so short a time can alter the</span><br/>
<span id='10'>condition of a man!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown</span><br/>
<span id='13'>from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a</span><br/>
<span id='14'>creeping thing.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>He loved his mother dearly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother</span><br/>
<span id='17'>now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness</span><br/>
<span id='18'>of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he</span><br/>
<span id='19'>moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before</span><br/>
<span id='20'>his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with</span><br/>
<span id='21'>his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a</span><br/>
<span id='22'>battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with</span><br/>
<span id='24'>his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity</span><br/>
<span id='25'>and a heaven to throne in.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his</span><br/>
<span id='28'>mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy</span><br/>
<span id='29'>in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that</span><br/>
<span id='30'>shall our poor city find: and all this is long of</span><br/>
<span id='31'>you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>The gods be good unto us!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto</span><br/>
<span id='34'>us. When we banished him, we respected not them;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And hale him up and down, all swearing, if</span><br/>
<span id='39'>The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>They'll give him death by inches.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a second Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>What's the news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>Second Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Friend,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Second Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>As certain as I know the sun is fire:</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!</span><br/>
<p><em>Trumpets; hautboys; drums beat; all together</em></p>
<span id='52'>The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Make the sun dance. Hark you!</span><br/>
<p><em>A shout within</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MENENIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>This is good news:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>A city full of tribunes, such as you,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>This morning for ten thousand of your throats</span><br/>
<span id='61'>I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!</span><br/>
<p><em>Music still, with shouts</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Accept my thankfulness.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Second Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>Sir, we have all</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Great cause to give great thanks.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>They are near the city?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>Second Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Almost at point to enter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SICINIUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>We will meet them,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And help the joy.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

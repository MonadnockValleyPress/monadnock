<h1>Love's Labours Lost</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene II</h3>
<h4>The same.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SIR NATHANIEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Very reverend sport, truly; and done in the testimony</span><br/>
<span id='2'>of a good conscience.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe</span><br/>
<span id='4'>as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in</span><br/>
<span id='5'>the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven;</span><br/>
<span id='6'>and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>the soil, the land, the earth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SIR NATHANIEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly</span><br/>
<span id='9'>varied, like a scholar at the least: but, sir, I</span><br/>
<span id='10'>assure ye, it was a buck of the first head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DULL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of</span><br/>
<span id='14'>insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of</span><br/>
<span id='15'>explication; facere, as it were, replication, or</span><br/>
<span id='16'>rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his</span><br/>
<span id='17'>inclination, after his undressed, unpolished,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to</span><br/>
<span id='20'>insert again my haud credo for a deer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DULL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>I said the deer was not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Twice-sod simplicity, his coctus!</span><br/>
<span id='23'>O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SIR NATHANIEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred</span><br/>
<span id='25'>in a book; he hath not eat paper, as it were; he</span><br/>
<span id='26'>hath not drunk ink: his intellect is not</span><br/>
<span id='27'>replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in</span><br/>
<span id='28'>the duller parts:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And such barren plants are set before us, that we</span><br/>
<span id='30'>thankful should be,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that</span><br/>
<span id='32'>do fructify in us more than he.</span><br/>
<span id='33'>For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>But omne bene, say I; being of an old father's mind,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>DULL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit</span><br/>
<span id='38'>What was a month old at Cain's birth, that's not five</span><br/>
<span id='39'>weeks old as yet?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>DULL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>What is Dictynna?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SIR NATHANIEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>And raught not to five weeks when he came to</span><br/>
<span id='45'>five-score.</span><br/>
<span id='46'>The allusion holds in the exchange.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>DULL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>'Tis true indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>God comfort thy capacity! I say, the allusion holds</span><br/>
<span id='49'>in the exchange.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>DULL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>And I say, the pollusion holds in the exchange; for</span><br/>
<span id='51'>the moon is never but a month old: and I say beside</span><br/>
<span id='52'>that, 'twas a pricket that the princess killed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph</span><br/>
<span id='54'>on the death of the deer? And, to humour the</span><br/>
<span id='55'>ignorant, call I the deer the princess killed a pricket.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SIR NATHANIEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge; so it shall</span><br/>
<span id='57'>please you to abrogate scurrility.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.</span><br/>
<span id='59'>The preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty</span><br/>
<span id='60'>pleasing pricket;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now made</span><br/>
<span id='62'>sore with shooting.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>The dogs did yell: put L to sore, then sorel jumps</span><br/>
<span id='64'>from thicket;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores</span><br/>
<span id='67'>one sorel.</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SIR NATHANIEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>A rare talent!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>DULL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>[Aside]  If a talent be a claw, look how he claws</span><br/>
<span id='71'>him with a talent.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a</span><br/>
<span id='73'>foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of</span><br/>
<span id='76'>memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and</span><br/>
<span id='77'>delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the</span><br/>
<span id='78'>gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am</span><br/>
<span id='79'>thankful for it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>SIR NATHANIEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Sir, I praise the Lord for you; and so may my</span><br/>
<span id='81'>parishioners; for their sons are well tutored by</span><br/>
<span id='82'>you, and their daughters profit very greatly under</span><br/>
<span id='83'>you: you are a good member of the commonwealth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Mehercle, if their sons be ingenuous, they shall</span><br/>
<span id='85'>want no instruction; if their daughters be capable,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>I will put it to them: but vir sapit qui pauca</span><br/>
<span id='87'>loquitur; a soul feminine saluteth us.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>JAQUENETTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>God give you good morrow, master Parson.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Master Parson, quasi pers-on. An if one should be</span><br/>
<span id='90'>pierced, which is the one?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>COSTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>Marry, master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Piercing a hogshead! a good lustre of conceit in a</span><br/>
<span id='93'>tuft of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enough</span><br/>
<span id='94'>for a swine: 'tis pretty; it is well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>JAQUENETTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Good master Parson, be so good as read me this</span><br/>
<span id='96'>letter: it was given me by Costard, and sent me</span><br/>
<span id='97'>from Don Armado: I beseech you, read it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>Fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Ruminat,&mdash;and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan! I</span><br/>
<span id='100'>may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice;</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Venetia, Venetia,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Chi non ti vede non ti pretia.</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! who understandeth thee</span><br/>
<span id='104'>not, loves thee not. Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? or rather,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>as Horace says in his&mdash;What, my soul, verses?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>SIR NATHANIEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>Ay, sir, and very learned.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>SIR NATHANIEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>[Reads]</span><br/>
<span id='110'>If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd!</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove:</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like</span><br/>
<span id='114'>osiers bow'd.</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Where all those pleasures live that art would</span><br/>
<span id='117'>comprehend:</span><br/>
<span id='118'>If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire:</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Which not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Celestial as thou art, O, pardon, love, this wrong,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>That sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>You find not the apostraphas, and so miss the</span><br/>
<span id='127'>accent: let me supervise the canzonet. Here are</span><br/>
<span id='128'>only numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret.</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Ovidius Naso was the man: and why, indeed, Naso,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of</span><br/>
<span id='132'>fancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is nothing:</span><br/>
<span id='133'>so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>was this directed to you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>JAQUENETTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strange</span><br/>
<span id='137'>queen's lords.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>I will overglance the superscript: 'To the</span><br/>
<span id='139'>snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Rosaline.' I will look again on the intellect of</span><br/>
<span id='141'>the letter, for the nomination of the party writing</span><br/>
<span id='142'>to the person written unto: 'Your ladyship's in all</span><br/>
<span id='143'>desired employment, BIRON.' Sir Nathaniel, this</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Biron is one of the votaries with the king; and here</span><br/>
<span id='145'>he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger</span><br/>
<span id='146'>queen's, which accidentally, or by the way of</span><br/>
<span id='147'>progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my</span><br/>
<span id='148'>sweet; deliver this paper into the royal hand of the</span><br/>
<span id='149'>king: it may concern much. Stay not thy</span><br/>
<span id='150'>compliment; I forgive thy duty; adieu.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>JAQUENETTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>COSTARD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='152'>Have with thee, my girl.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>SIR NATHANIEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very</span><br/>
<span id='154'>religiously; and, as a certain father saith,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='155'>Sir tell me not of the father; I do fear colourable</span><br/>
<span id='156'>colours. But to return to the verses: did they</span><br/>
<span id='157'>please you, Sir Nathaniel?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>SIR NATHANIEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>Marvellous well for the pen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>I do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupil</span><br/>
<span id='160'>of mine; where, if, before repast, it shall please</span><br/>
<span id='161'>you to gratify the table with a grace, I will, on my</span><br/>
<span id='162'>privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid</span><br/>
<span id='163'>child or pupil, undertake your ben venuto; where I</span><br/>
<span id='164'>will prove those verses to be very unlearned,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention: I</span><br/>
<span id='166'>beseech your society.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>SIR NATHANIEL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>And thank you too; for society, saith the text, is</span><br/>
<span id='168'>the happiness of life.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>HOLOFERNES</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='169'>And, certes, the text most infallibly concludes it.</span><br/>
<p><em>To DULL</em></p>
<span id='170'>Sir, I do invite you too; you shall not</span><br/>
<span id='171'>say me nay: pauca verba. Away! the gentles are at</span><br/>
<span id='172'>their game, and we will to our recreation.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

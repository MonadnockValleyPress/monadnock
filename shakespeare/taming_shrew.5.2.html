</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And time it is, when raging war is done,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>To smile at scapes and perils overblown.</span><br/>
<span id='4'>My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:</span><br/>
<span id='9'>My banquet is to close our stomachs up,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>For now we sit to chat as well as eat.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Padua affords nothing but what is kind.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>For both our sakes, I would that word were true.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Then never trust me, if I be afeard.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Roundly replied.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>                  Mistress, how mean you that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Thus I conceive by him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:</span><br/>
<span id='31'>And now you know my meaning,</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>A very mean meaning.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Right, I mean you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>And I am mean indeed, respecting you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>To her, Kate!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='36'>To her, widow!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>That's my office.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lad!</span><br/>
<p><em>Drinks to HORTENSIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Believe me, sir, they butt together well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Would say your head and butt were head and horn.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>VINCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Have at you for a bitter jest or two!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>And then pursue me as you draw your bow.</span><br/>
<span id='50'>You are welcome all.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt BIANCA, KATHARINA, and Widow</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Which runs himself and catches for his master.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>A good swift simile, but something currish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>TRANIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:</span><br/>
<span id='58'>'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;</span><br/>
<span id='63'>And, as the jest did glance away from me,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Let's each one send unto his wife;</span><br/>
<span id='69'>And he whose wife is most obedient</span><br/>
<span id='70'>To come at first when he doth send for her,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Shall win the wager which we will propose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Content. What is the wager?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Twenty crowns.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Twenty crowns!</span><br/>
<span id='75'>I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>But twenty times so much upon my wife.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>A hundred then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>                  Content.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>A match! 'tis done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Who shall begin?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>                  That will I.</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>I go.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter BIONDELLO</em></p>
<span id='86'>How now! what news?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>Sir, my mistress sends you word</span><br/>
<span id='88'>That she is busy and she cannot come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>How! she is busy and she cannot come!</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Is that an answer?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>GREMIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>                  Ay, and a kind one too:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>I hope better.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife</span><br/>
<span id='95'>To come to me forthwith.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit BIONDELLO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>O, ho! entreat her!</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Nay, then she must needs come.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>I am afraid, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter BIONDELLO</em></p>
<span id='100'>Now, where's my wife?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>BIONDELLO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>She says you have some goodly jest in hand:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>She will not come: she bids you come to her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Intolerable, not to be endured!</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Say, I command her to come to me.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit GRUMIO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>I know her answer.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>                  What?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>She will not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter KATARINA</em></p>

<blockquote>
<span id='112'>What is your will, sir, that you send for me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>They sit conferring by the parlor fire.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit KATHARINA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>HORTENSIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,</span><br/>
<span id='121'>And awful rule and right supremacy;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>BAPTISTA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!</span><br/>
<span id='124'>The wager thou hast won; and I will add</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Another dowry to another daughter,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>For she is changed, as she had never been.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Nay, I will win my wager better yet</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And show more sign of her obedience,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Her new-built virtue and obedience.</span><br/>
<span id='131'>See where she comes and brings your froward wives</span><br/>
<span id='132'>As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow</em></p>
<span id='133'>Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Till I be brought to such a silly pass!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>LUCENTIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>I would your duty were as foolish too:</span><br/>
<span id='139'>The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>BIANCA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>The more fool you, for laying on my duty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women</span><br/>
<span id='143'>What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Come on, I say; and first begin with her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>Widow</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>She shall not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>I say she shall: and first begin with her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>KATHARINA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:</span><br/>
<span id='151'>It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>And in no sense is meet or amiable.</span><br/>
<span id='154'>A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;</span><br/>
<span id='156'>And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>And for thy maintenance commits his body</span><br/>
<span id='161'>To painful labour both by sea and land,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;</span><br/>
<span id='164'>And craves no other tribute at thy hands</span><br/>
<span id='165'>But love, fair looks and true obedience;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Too little payment for so great a debt.</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Such duty as the subject owes the prince</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Even such a woman oweth to her husband;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,</span><br/>
<span id='170'>And not obedient to his honest will,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>What is she but a foul contending rebel</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And graceless traitor to her loving lord?</span><br/>
<span id='173'>I am ashamed that women are so simple</span><br/>
<span id='174'>To offer war where they should kneel for peace;</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>When they are bound to serve, love and obey.</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>But that our soft conditions and our hearts</span><br/>
<span id='180'>Should well agree with our external parts?</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Come, come, you froward and unable worms!</span><br/>
<span id='182'>My mind hath been as big as one of yours,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>My heart as great, my reason haply more,</span><br/>
<span id='184'>To bandy word for word and frown for frown;</span><br/>
<span id='185'>But now I see our lances are but straws,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,</span><br/>
<span id='187'>That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.</span><br/>
<span id='188'>Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,</span><br/>
<span id='189'>And place your hands below your husband's foot:</span><br/>
<span id='190'>In token of which duty, if he please,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>My hand is ready; may it do him ease.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>PETRUCHIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.</span><br/>

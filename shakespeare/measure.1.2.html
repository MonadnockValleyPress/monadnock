<h1>Measure for Measure</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene II</h3>
<h4>A Street.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>If the duke with the other dukes come not to</span><br/>
<span id='2'>composition with the King of Hungary, why then all</span><br/>
<span id='3'>the dukes fall upon the king.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Hungary's!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Amen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that</span><br/>
<span id='8'>went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped</span><br/>
<span id='9'>one out of the table.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>'Thou shalt not steal'?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Ay, that he razed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and</span><br/>
<span id='13'>all the rest from their functions: they put forth</span><br/>
<span id='14'>to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in</span><br/>
<span id='15'>the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition</span><br/>
<span id='16'>well that prays for peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>I never heard any soldier dislike it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where</span><br/>
<span id='19'>grace was said.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>No? a dozen times at least.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>What, in metre?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>In any proportion or in any language.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>I think, or in any religion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all</span><br/>
<span id='25'>controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a</span><br/>
<span id='26'>wicked villain, despite of all grace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>I grant; as there may between the lists and the</span><br/>
<span id='29'>velvet. Thou art the list.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt</span><br/>
<span id='31'>a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief</span><br/>
<span id='32'>be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou</span><br/>
<span id='33'>art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak</span><br/>
<span id='34'>feelingly now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful</span><br/>
<span id='36'>feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own</span><br/>
<span id='37'>confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I</span><br/>
<span id='38'>live, forget to drink after thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I</span><br/>
<span id='42'>have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>To what, I pray?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Judge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>To three thousand dolours a year.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>Ay, and more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>A French crown more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou</span><br/>
<span id='49'>art full of error; I am sound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as</span><br/>
<span id='51'>things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>impiety has made a feast of thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>MISTRESS OVERDONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried</span><br/>
<span id='55'>to prison was worth five thousand of you all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Who's that, I pray thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>MISTRESS OVERDONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>MISTRESS OVERDONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw</span><br/>
<span id='60'>him carried away; and, which is more, within these</span><br/>
<span id='61'>three days his head to be chopped off.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Art thou sure of this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>MISTRESS OVERDONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Julietta with child.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two</span><br/>
<span id='67'>hours since, and he was ever precise in</span><br/>
<span id='68'>promise-keeping.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>Second Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Besides, you know, it draws something near to the</span><br/>
<span id='70'>speech we had to such a purpose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>First Gentleman</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='72'>Away! let's go learn the truth of it.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>MISTRESS OVERDONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what</span><br/>
<span id='74'>with the gallows and what with poverty, I am</span><br/>
<span id='75'>custom-shrunk.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter POMPEY</em></p>
<span id='76'>How now! what's the news with you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='77'>Yonder man is carried to prison.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>MISTRESS OVERDONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='78'>Well; what has he done?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>A woman.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>MISTRESS OVERDONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>But what's his offence?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MISTRESS OVERDONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>What, is there a maid with child by him?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have</span><br/>
<span id='84'>not heard of the proclamation, have you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>MISTRESS OVERDONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>What proclamation, man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>MISTRESS OVERDONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>And what shall become of those in the city?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>but that a wise burgher put in for them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>MISTRESS OVERDONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be</span><br/>
<span id='91'>pulled down?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>To the ground, mistress.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>MISTRESS OVERDONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!</span><br/>
<span id='94'>What shall become of me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no</span><br/>
<span id='96'>clients: though you change your place, you need not</span><br/>
<span id='97'>change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that</span><br/>
<span id='99'>have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you</span><br/>
<span id='100'>will be considered.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>MISTRESS OVERDONE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>POMPEY</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to</span><br/>
<span id='103'>prison; and there's Madam Juliet.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
<p><em>Enter Provost, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and Officers</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Bear me to prison, where I am committed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>Provost</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>I do it not in evil disposition,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>But from Lord Angelo by special charge.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>Thus can the demigod Authority</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Make us pay down for our offence by weight</span><br/>
<span id='110'>The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;</span><br/>
<span id='111'>On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='113'>From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>As surfeit is the father of much fast,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>So every scope by the immoderate use</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would</span><br/>
<span id='120'>send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say</span><br/>
<span id='121'>the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom</span><br/>
<span id='122'>as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy</span><br/>
<span id='123'>offence, Claudio?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>What but to speak of would offend again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='125'>What, is't murder?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='126'>No.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='127'>Lechery?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>Call it so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>Provost</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>Away, sir! you must go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>A hundred, if they'll do you any good.</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Is lechery so look'd after?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract</span><br/>
<span id='134'>I got possession of Julietta's bed:</span><br/>
<span id='135'>You know the lady; she is fast my wife,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Save that we do the denunciation lack</span><br/>
<span id='137'>Of outward order: this we came not to,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Only for propagation of a dower</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Remaining in the coffer of her friends,</span><br/>
<span id='140'>From whom we thought it meet to hide our love</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Till time had made them for us. But it chances</span><br/>
<span id='142'>The stealth of our most mutual entertainment</span><br/>
<span id='143'>With character too gross is writ on Juliet.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>With child, perhaps?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>Unhappily, even so.</span><br/>
<span id='146'>And the new deputy now for the duke&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Or whether that the body public be</span><br/>
<span id='149'>A horse whereon the governor doth ride,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Who, newly in the seat, that it may know</span><br/>
<span id='151'>He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Whether the tyranny be in his place,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Or in his eminence that fills it up,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>I stagger in:&mdash;but this new governor</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Awakes me all the enrolled penalties</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall</span><br/>
<span id='157'>So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round</span><br/>
<span id='158'>And none of them been worn; and, for a name,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Now puts the drowsy and neglected act</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on</span><br/>
<span id='162'>thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to</span><br/>
<span id='164'>him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>I have done so, but he's not to be found.</span><br/>
<span id='166'>I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:</span><br/>
<span id='167'>This day my sister should the cloister enter</span><br/>
<span id='168'>And there receive her approbation:</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Acquaint her with the danger of my state:</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends</span><br/>
<span id='171'>To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:</span><br/>
<span id='172'>I have great hope in that; for in her youth</span><br/>
<span id='173'>There is a prone and speechless dialect,</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art</span><br/>
<span id='175'>When she will play with reason and discourse,</span><br/>
<span id='176'>And well she can persuade.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='177'>I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the</span><br/>
<span id='178'>like, which else would stand under grievous</span><br/>
<span id='179'>imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I</span><br/>
<span id='180'>would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a</span><br/>
<span id='181'>game of tick-tack. I'll to her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='182'>I thank you, good friend Lucio.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>LUCIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='183'>Within two hours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>CLAUDIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='184'>                  Come, officer, away!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

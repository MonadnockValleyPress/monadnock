<h1>The Tempest</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act V, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Before Prospero's cell.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Now does my project gather to a head:</span><br/>
<span id='2'>My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>ARIEL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>You said our work should cease.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>I did say so,</span><br/>
<span id='7'>When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,</span><br/>
<span id='8'>How fares the king and's followers?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ARIEL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>Confined together</span><br/>
<span id='10'>In the same fashion as you gave in charge,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;</span><br/>
<span id='13'>They cannot budge till your release. The king,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>His brother and yours, abide all three distracted</span><br/>
<span id='15'>And the remainder mourning over them,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'</span><br/>
<span id='18'>His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops</span><br/>
<span id='19'>From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em</span><br/>
<span id='20'>That if you now beheld them, your affections</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Would become tender.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Dost thou think so, spirit?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ARIEL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>Mine would, sir, were I human.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>And mine shall.</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Do I take part: the rarer action is</span><br/>
<span id='32'>In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,</span><br/>
<span id='33'>The sole drift of my purpose doth extend</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>And they shall be themselves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ARIEL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>I'll fetch them, sir.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='38'>Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And ye that on the sands with printless foot</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him</span><br/>
<span id='41'>When he comes back; you demi-puppets that</span><br/>
<span id='42'>By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice</span><br/>
<span id='45'>To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd</span><br/>
<span id='47'>The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak</span><br/>
<span id='51'>With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up</span><br/>
<span id='53'>The pine and cedar: graves at my command</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth</span><br/>
<span id='55'>By my so potent art. But this rough magic</span><br/>
<span id='56'>I here abjure, and, when I have required</span><br/>
<span id='57'>Some heavenly music, which even now I do,</span><br/>
<span id='58'>To work mine end upon their senses that</span><br/>
<span id='59'>This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>And deeper than did ever plummet sound</span><br/>
<span id='62'>I'll drown my book.</span><br/>
<p><em>Solemn music</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a  frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO;  SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,  attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO   they all  enter the circle which PROSPERO had made,  and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing, speaks:</em></p>
<span id='63'>A solemn air and the best comforter</span><br/>
<span id='64'>To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>For you are spell-stopp'd.</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>And as the morning steals upon the night,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>Melting the darkness, so their rising senses</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle</span><br/>
<span id='73'>Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>My true preserver, and a loyal sir</span><br/>
<span id='75'>To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces</span><br/>
<span id='76'>Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,</span><br/>
<span id='80'>You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Begins to swell, and the approaching tide</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Will shortly fill the reasonable shore</span><br/>
<span id='87'>That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them</span><br/>
<span id='88'>That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:</span><br/>
<span id='90'>I will discase me, and myself present</span><br/>
<span id='91'>As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Thou shalt ere long be free.</span><br/>
<p><em>ARIEL sings and helps to attire him</em></p>
<span id='93'>Where the bee sucks. there suck I:</span><br/>
<span id='94'>In a cowslip's bell I lie;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>There I couch when owls do cry.</span><br/>
<span id='96'>On the bat's back I do fly</span><br/>
<span id='97'>After summer merrily.</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Merrily, merrily shall I live now</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:</span><br/>
<span id='101'>But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.</span><br/>
<span id='102'>To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:</span><br/>
<span id='103'>There shalt thou find the mariners asleep</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Being awake, enforce them to this place,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And presently, I prithee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ARIEL</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>I drink the air before me, and return</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Or ere your pulse twice beat.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>GONZALO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Out of this fearful country!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Behold, sir king,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:</span><br/>
<span id='114'>For more assurance that a living prince</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>And to thee and thy company I bid</span><br/>
<span id='117'>A hearty welcome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>ALONSO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>                  Whether thou best he or no,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>The affliction of my mind amends, with which,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>An if this be at all, a most strange story.</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero</span><br/>
<span id='127'>Be living and be here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>First, noble friend,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Be measured or confined.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>GONZALO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='131'>Whether this be</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Or be not, I'll not swear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>You do yet taste</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!</span><br/>
<p><em>Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO</em></p>
<span id='136'>But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,</span><br/>
<span id='137'>I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you</span><br/>
<span id='138'>And justify you traitors: at this time</span><br/>
<span id='139'>I will tell no tales.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>[Aside]  The devil speaks in him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>No.</span><br/>
<span id='142'>For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require</span><br/>
<span id='145'>My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Thou must restore.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>ALONSO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>                  If thou be'st Prospero,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>Give us particulars of thy preservation;</span><br/>
<span id='149'>How thou hast met us here, who three hours since</span><br/>
<span id='150'>Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='151'>How sharp the point of this remembrance is!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='152'>My dear son Ferdinand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>I am woe for't, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>ALONSO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>Irreparable is the loss, and patience</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Says it is past her cure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='156'>I rather think</span><br/>
<span id='157'>You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace</span><br/>
<span id='158'>For the like loss I have her sovereign aid</span><br/>
<span id='159'>And rest myself content.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>ALONSO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='160'>You the like loss!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='161'>As great to me as late; and, supportable</span><br/>
<span id='162'>To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Than you may call to comfort you, for I</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Have lost my daughter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ALONSO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>A daughter?</span><br/>
<span id='166'>O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>The king and queen there! that they were, I wish</span><br/>
<span id='168'>Myself were mudded in that oozy bed</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>PROSPERO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>In this last tempest. I perceive these lords</span><br/>
<span id='171'>At this encounter do so much admire</span><br/>
<span id='172'>That they devour their reason and scarce think</span><br/>
<span id='173'>Their eyes do offices of truth, their words</span><br/>
<span id='174'>Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have</span><br/>
<span id='175'>Been justled from your senses, know for certain</span><br/>
<span id='176'>That I am Prospero and that very duke</span><br/>
<span id='177'>Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely</span><br/>
<span id='178'>Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,</span><br/>
<span id='179'>To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;</span><br/>
<span id='180'>For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Not a relation for a breakfast nor</span><br/>
<span id='182'>Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;</span><br/>
<span id='183'>This cell's my court: here have I few attendants</span><br/>
<span id='184'>And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.</span><br/>
<span id='185'>My dukedom since you have given me again,</span><br/>
<span id='186'>I will requite you with as good a thing;</span><br/>
<span id='187'>At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye</span><br/>
<span id='188'>As much as me my dukedom.</span><br/>
<p><em>Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess</em></p>

<span id='speech28'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>Sweet lord, you play me false.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>FERDINAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='190'>No, my dear'st love,</span><br/>
<span id='191'>I would not for the world.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>MIRANDA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='192'>Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,</span><br/>
<span id='193'>And I would call it, fair play.</span><br/>

<span id='214'>I chose her when I could not ask my father</span><br/>
<span id='215'>For his advice, nor thought I had one. She</span><br/>
<span id='216'>Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,</span><br/>
<span id='217'>Of whom so often I have heard renown,</span><br/>
<span id='218'>But never saw before; of whom I have</span><br/>

<span id='279'>Sir, my liege,</span><br/>
<span id='280'>Do not infest your mind with beating on</span><br/>
<span id='281'>The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure</span><br/>
<span id='282'>Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,</span><br/>
<span id='283'>Which to you shall seem probable, of every</span><br/>

<span id='speech55'><strong>STEPHANO</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='292'>Every man shift for all the rest, and</span><br/>
<span id='293'>let no man take care for himself; for all is</span><br/>

<span id='305'>Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,</span><br/>
<span id='306'>Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,</span><br/>
<span id='307'>His mother was a witch, and one so strong</span><br/>
<span id='308'>That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,</span><br/>
<span id='309'>And deal in her command without her power.</span><br/>
<span id='310'>These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil&mdash;</span><br/>

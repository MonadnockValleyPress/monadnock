<h1>Henry VI, Part 1</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act I, Scene I</h3>
<h4>Westminster Abbey.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Dead March. Enter the Funeral of KING HENRY the  Fifth, attended on by Dukes of BEDFORD, Regent of  France; GLOUCESTER, Protector; and EXETER, Earl of WARWICK, the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, Heralds,  &amp;c</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!</span><br/>
<span id='2'>Comets, importing change of times and states,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,</span><br/>
<span id='4'>And with them scourge the bad revolting stars</span><br/>
<span id='5'>That have consented unto Henry's death!</span><br/>
<span id='6'>King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!</span><br/>
<span id='7'>England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>England ne'er had a king until his time.</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Virtue he had, deserving to command:</span><br/>
<span id='10'>His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:</span><br/>
<span id='11'>His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>More dazzled and drove back his enemies</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:</span><br/>
<span id='16'>He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Henry is dead and never shall revive:</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Upon a wooden coffin we attend,</span><br/>
<span id='20'>And death's dishonourable victory</span><br/>
<span id='21'>We with our stately presence glorify,</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Like captives bound to a triumphant car.</span><br/>
<span id='23'>What! shall we curse the planets of mishap</span><br/>
<span id='24'>That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Or shall we think the subtle-witted French</span><br/>
<span id='26'>Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him</span><br/>
<span id='27'>By magic verses have contrived his end?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='28'>He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day</span><br/>
<span id='30'>So dreadful will not be as was his sight.</span><br/>
<span id='31'>The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:</span><br/>
<span id='32'>The church's prayers made him so prosperous.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:</span><br/>
<span id='35'>None do you like but an effeminate prince,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art protector</span><br/>
<span id='38'>And lookest to command the prince and realm.</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>More than God or religious churchmen may.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Except it be to pray against thy foes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Posterity, await for wretched years,</span><br/>
<span id='49'>When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>And none but women left to wail the dead.</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!</span><br/>
<span id='55'>A far more glorious star thy soul will make</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Than Julius Caesar or bright&mdash;</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>My honourable lords, health to you all!</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,</span><br/>
<span id='59'>Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?</span><br/>
<span id='63'>Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?</span><br/>
<span id='66'>If Henry were recall'd to life again,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='68'>How were they lost? what treachery was used?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>No treachery; but want of men and money.</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>That here you maintain several factions,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>You are disputing of your generals:</span><br/>
<span id='74'>One would have lingering wars with little cost;</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;</span><br/>
<span id='76'>A third thinks, without expense at all,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Awake, awake, English nobility!</span><br/>
<span id='79'>Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>Of England's coat one half is cut away.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Were our tears wanting to this funeral,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Me they concern; Regent I am of France.</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>To weep their intermissive miseries.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter to them another Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance.</span><br/>
<span id='90'>France is revolted from the English quite,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Except some petty towns of no import:</span><br/>
<span id='92'>The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;</span><br/>
<span id='93'>The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;</span><br/>
<span id='95'>The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!</span><br/>
<span id='97'>O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats.</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?</span><br/>
<span id='101'>An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Wherewith already France is overrun.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter another Messenger</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>My gracious lords, to add to your laments,</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,</span><br/>
<span id='105'>I must inform you of a dismal fight</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:</span><br/>
<span id='109'>The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.</span><br/>
<span id='110'>The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Retiring from the siege of Orleans,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.</span><br/>
<span id='113'>By three and twenty thousand of the French</span><br/>
<span id='114'>Was round encompassed and set upon.</span><br/>
<span id='115'>No leisure had he to enrank his men;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>He wanted pikes to set before his archers;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges</span><br/>
<span id='118'>They pitched in the ground confusedly,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.</span><br/>
<span id='120'>More than three hours the fight continued;</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Where valiant Talbot above human thought</span><br/>
<span id='122'>Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:</span><br/>
<span id='125'>The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;</span><br/>
<span id='126'>All the whole army stood agazed on him:</span><br/>
<span id='127'>His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit</span><br/>
<span id='128'>A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain</span><br/>
<span id='129'>And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:</span><br/>
<span id='132'>He, being in the vaward, placed behind</span><br/>
<span id='133'>With purpose to relieve and follow them,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.</span><br/>
<span id='135'>Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;</span><br/>
<span id='136'>Enclosed were they with their enemies:</span><br/>
<span id='137'>A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,</span><br/>
<span id='138'>Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Whom all France with their chief assembled strength</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Durst not presume to look once in the face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,</span><br/>
<span id='142'>For living idly here in pomp and ease,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,</span><br/>
<span id='144'>Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>O no, he lives; but is took prisoner,</span><br/>
<span id='146'>And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>His ransom there is none but I shall pay:</span><br/>
<span id='149'>I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:</span><br/>
<span id='150'>His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;</span><br/>
<span id='151'>Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>Messenger</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='157'>So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;</span><br/>
<span id='158'>The English army is grown weak and faint:</span><br/>
<span id='159'>The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='162'>Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>BEDFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>I do remember it; and here take my leave,</span><br/>
<span id='166'>To go about my preparation.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>GLOUCESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='167'>I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can,</span><br/>
<span id='168'>To view the artillery and munition;</span><br/>
<span id='169'>And then I will proclaim young Henry king.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>EXETER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='170'>To Eltham will I, where the young king is,</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Being ordain'd his special governor,</span><br/>
<span id='172'>And for his safety there I'll best devise.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='173'>Each hath his place and function to attend:</span><br/>
<span id='174'>I am left out; for me nothing remains.</span><br/>
<span id='175'>But long I will not be Jack out of office:</span><br/>
<span id='176'>The king from Eltham I intend to steal</span><br/>
<span id='177'>And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>

<h4>Milan. The Duke's palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter VALENTINE and SPEED</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Sir, your glove.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>                  Not mine; my gloves are on.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine:</span><br/>
<span id='5'>Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Ah, Silvia, Silvia!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>How now, sirrah?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>She is not within hearing, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Why, sir, who bade you call her?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>Well, you'll still be too forward.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>She that your worship loves?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Why, how know you that I am in love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Marry, by these special marks: first, you have</span><br/>
<span id='18'>learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,</span><br/>
<span id='19'>like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a</span><br/>
<span id='20'>robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had</span><br/>
<span id='21'>the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had</span><br/>
<span id='22'>lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had</span><br/>
<span id='23'>buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes</span><br/>
<span id='24'>diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to</span><br/>
<span id='25'>speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were</span><br/>
<span id='26'>wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you</span><br/>
<span id='27'>walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you</span><br/>
<span id='28'>fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you</span><br/>
<span id='29'>looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you</span><br/>
<span id='30'>are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look</span><br/>
<span id='31'>on you, I can hardly think you my master.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Are all these things perceived in me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>They are all perceived without ye.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Without me? they cannot.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you</span><br/>
<span id='36'>were so simple, none else would: but you are so</span><br/>
<span id='37'>without these follies, that these follies are within</span><br/>
<span id='38'>you and shine through you like the water in an</span><br/>
<span id='39'>urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a</span><br/>
<span id='40'>physician to comment on your malady.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='41'>But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Why, sir, I know her not.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet</span><br/>
<span id='46'>knowest her not?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Is she not hard-favoured, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Sir, I know that well enough.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>What dost thou know?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>That's because the one is painted and the other out</span><br/>
<span id='54'>of all count.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>How painted? and how out of count?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no</span><br/>
<span id='57'>man counts of her beauty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>You never saw her since she was deformed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>How long hath she been deformed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='61'>Ever since you loved her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I</span><br/>
<span id='63'>see her beautiful.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>If you love her, you cannot see her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>Why?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='66'>Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;</span><br/>
<span id='67'>or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to</span><br/>
<span id='68'>have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going</span><br/>
<span id='69'>ungartered!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>What should I see then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>Your own present folly and her passing deformity:</span><br/>
<span id='72'>for he, being in love, could not see to garter his</span><br/>
<span id='73'>hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last</span><br/>
<span id='75'>morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>you swinged me for my love, which makes me the</span><br/>
<span id='78'>bolder to chide you for yours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>In conclusion, I stand affected to her.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>I would you were set, so your affection would cease.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to</span><br/>
<span id='82'>one she loves.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>And have you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>I have.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Are they not lamely writ?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!</span><br/>
<span id='87'>here she comes.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>[Aside]  O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Now will he interpret to her.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter SILVIA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech54'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech55'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='91'>[Aside]  O, give ye good even! here's a million of manners.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech56'><strong>SILVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='92'>Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech57'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>[Aside]  He should give her interest and she gives it him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech58'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='94'>As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;</span><br/>
<span id='96'>Which I was much unwilling to proceed in</span><br/>
<span id='97'>But for my duty to your ladyship.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech59'><strong>SILVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech60'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;</span><br/>
<span id='100'>For being ignorant to whom it goes</span><br/>
<span id='101'>I writ at random, very doubtfully.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech61'><strong>SILVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='102'>Perchance you think too much of so much pains?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech62'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>No, madam; so it stead you, I will write</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Please you command, a thousand times as much; And yet&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech63'><strong>SILVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='105'>A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech64'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>[Aside]  And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech65'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>What means your ladyship? do you not like it?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech66'><strong>SILVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>But since unwillingly, take them again.</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Nay, take them.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech67'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Madam, they are for you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech68'><strong>SILVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='115'>Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>But I will none of them; they are for you;</span><br/>
<span id='117'>I would have had them writ more movingly.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech69'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='118'>Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech70'><strong>SILVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='119'>And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,</span><br/>
<span id='120'>And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech71'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>If it please me, madam, what then?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech72'><strong>SILVIA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='122'>Why, if it please you, take it for your labour:</span><br/>
<span id='123'>And so, good morrow, servant.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech73'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='124'>O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!</span><br/>
<span id='126'>My master sues to her, and she hath</span><br/>
<span id='127'>taught her suitor,</span><br/>
<span id='128'>He being her pupil, to become her tutor.</span><br/>
<span id='129'>O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>That my master, being scribe, to himself should write</span><br/>
<span id='131'>the letter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech74'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='132'>How now, sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech75'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech76'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>To do what?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech77'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech78'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='136'>To whom?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech79'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>To yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech80'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>What figure?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech81'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>By a letter, I should say.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech82'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Why, she hath not writ to me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech83'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='141'>What need she, when she hath made you write to</span><br/>
<span id='142'>yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech84'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='143'>No, believe me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech85'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive</span><br/>
<span id='145'>her earnest?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech86'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='146'>She gave me none, except an angry word.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech87'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='147'>Why, she hath given you a letter.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech88'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='148'>That's the letter I writ to her friend.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech89'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='149'>And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech90'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>I would it were no worse.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech91'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>I'll warrant you, 'tis as well:</span><br/>
<span id='152'>For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;</span><br/>
<span id='154'>Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,</span><br/>
<span id='155'>Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.</span><br/>
<span id='156'>All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Why muse you, sir? 'tis dinner-time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech92'><strong>VALENTINE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='158'>I have dined.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech93'><strong>SPEED</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='159'>Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can</span><br/>
<span id='160'>feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my</span><br/>
<span id='161'>victuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not like</span><br/>
<span id='162'>your mistress; be moved, be moved.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>A Midsummer Night's Dream</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene I</H3>
<h4>The wood. Titania lying asleep.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Are we all met?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>QUINCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place</span><br/>
<span id='3'>for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our</span><br/>
<span id='4'>stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we</span><br/>
<span id='5'>will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Peter Quince,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>QUINCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>What sayest thou, bully Bottom?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and</span><br/>
<span id='9'>Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must</span><br/>
<span id='10'>draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies</span><br/>
<span id='11'>cannot abide. How answer you that?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SNOUT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>By'r lakin, a parlous fear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>STARVELING</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to</span><br/>
<span id='16'>say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more</span><br/>
<span id='18'>better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not</span><br/>
<span id='19'>Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them</span><br/>
<span id='20'>out of fear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>QUINCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be</span><br/>
<span id='22'>written in eight and six.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='23'>No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>SNOUT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>STARVELING</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>I fear it, I promise you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to</span><br/>
<span id='27'>bring in&mdash;God shield us!&mdash;a lion among ladies, is a</span><br/>
<span id='28'>most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful</span><br/>
<span id='29'>wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to</span><br/>
<span id='30'>look to 't.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>SNOUT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must</span><br/>
<span id='33'>be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself</span><br/>
<span id='34'>must speak through, saying thus, or to the same</span><br/>
<span id='35'>defect,&mdash;'Ladies,'&mdash;or 'Fair-ladies&mdash;I would wish</span><br/>
<span id='36'>You,'&mdash;or 'I would request you,'&mdash;or 'I would</span><br/>
<span id='37'>entreat you,&mdash;not to fear, not to tremble: my life</span><br/>
<span id='38'>for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it</span><br/>
<span id='39'>were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a</span><br/>
<span id='40'>man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name</span><br/>
<span id='41'>his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>QUINCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='42'>Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;</span><br/>
<span id='43'>that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,</span><br/>
<span id='44'>you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>SNOUT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find</span><br/>
<span id='47'>out moonshine, find out moonshine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>QUINCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Yes, it doth shine that night.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='49'>Why, then may you leave a casement of the great</span><br/>
<span id='50'>chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon</span><br/>
<span id='51'>may shine in at the casement.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>QUINCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='52'>Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns</span><br/>
<span id='53'>and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to</span><br/>
<span id='54'>present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is</span><br/>
<span id='55'>another thing: we must have a wall in the great</span><br/>
<span id='56'>chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did</span><br/>
<span id='57'>talk through the chink of a wall.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>SNOUT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>Some man or other must present Wall: and let him</span><br/>
<span id='60'>have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast</span><br/>
<span id='61'>about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his</span><br/>
<span id='62'>fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus</span><br/>
<span id='63'>and Thisby whisper.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>QUINCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit  down,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your</span><br/>
<span id='67'>speech, enter into that brake: and so every one</span><br/>
<span id='68'>according to his cue.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PUCK behind</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>So near the cradle of the fairy queen?</span><br/>
<span id='71'>What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;</span><br/>
<span id='72'>An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>QUINCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>QUINCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='75'>Odours, odours.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>&mdash;odours savours sweet:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.</span><br/>
<span id='78'>But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>And by and by I will to thee appear.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>FLUTE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Must I speak now?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>QUINCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes</span><br/>
<span id='83'>but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>FLUTE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,</span><br/>
<span id='87'>As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>QUINCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that</span><br/>
<span id='90'>yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your</span><br/>
<span id='91'>part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue</span><br/>
<span id='92'>is past; it is, 'never tire.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>FLUTE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>O,&mdash;As true as truest horse, that yet would</span><br/>
<span id='94'>never tire.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>QUINCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='96'>O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>masters! fly, masters! Help!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt QUINCE, SNUG, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>PUCK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,</span><br/>
<span id='101'>A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to</span><br/>
<span id='105'>make me afeard.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter SNOUT</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>SNOUT</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='106'>O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='107'>What do you see? you see an asshead of your own, do</span><br/>
<span id='108'>you?</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit SNOUT</em></p>
<p><em>Re-enter QUINCE</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>QUINCE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art</span><br/>
<span id='110'>translated.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir</span><br/>
<span id='113'>from this place, do what they can: I will walk up</span><br/>
<span id='114'>and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear</span><br/>
<span id='115'>I am not afraid.</span><br/>
<p><em>Sings</em></p>
<span id='116'>The ousel cock so black of hue,</span><br/>
<span id='117'>With orange-tawny bill,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>The throstle with his note so true,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>The wren with little quill,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='120'>[Awaking]  What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='121'>[Sings]</span><br/>
<span id='122'>The finch, the sparrow and the lark,</span><br/>
<span id='123'>The plain-song cuckoo gray,</span><br/>
<span id='124'>Whose note full many a man doth mark,</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And dares not answer nay;&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='126'>for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish</span><br/>
<span id='127'>a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry</span><br/>
<span id='128'>'cuckoo' never so?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='129'>I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:</span><br/>
<span id='130'>Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;</span><br/>
<span id='131'>So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;</span><br/>
<span id='132'>And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me</span><br/>
<span id='133'>On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='134'>Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason</span><br/>
<span id='135'>for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and</span><br/>
<span id='136'>love keep little company together now-a-days; the</span><br/>
<span id='137'>more the pity that some honest neighbours will not</span><br/>
<span id='138'>make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='139'>Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>BOTTOM</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='140'>Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out</span><br/>
<span id='141'>of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>TITANIA</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>Out of this wood do not desire to go:</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.</span><br/>
<span id='144'>I am a spirit of no common rate;</span><br/>
<span id='145'>The summer still doth tend upon my state;</span><br/>
<span id='146'>And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;</span><br/>
<span id='147'>I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,</span><br/>
<span id='148'>And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,</span><br/>
<span id='149'>And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;</span><br/>
<span id='150'>And I will purge thy mortal grossness so</span><br/>
<span id='151'>That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.</span><br/>
<span id='152'>Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSEED</em></p>

<span id='158'>Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;</span><br/>
<span id='159'>Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,</span><br/>
<span id='161'>With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;</span><br/>
<span id='162'>The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,</span><br/>
<span id='163'>And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs</span><br/>
<span id='164'>And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>To have my love to bed and to arise;</span><br/>
<span id='166'>And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies</span><br/>
<span id='167'>To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:</span><br/>

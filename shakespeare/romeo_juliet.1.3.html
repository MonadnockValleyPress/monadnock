<em>Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Nurse</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,</span><br/>
<span id='3'>I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!</span><br/>
<span id='4'>God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter JULIET</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>How now! who calls?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>Nurse</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='6'>Your mother.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Madam, I am here.</span><br/>
<span id='8'>What is your will?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>This is the matter:&mdash;Nurse, give leave awhile,</span><br/>
<span id='10'>We must talk in secret:&mdash;nurse, come back again;</span><br/>
<span id='11'>I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>Nurse</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='13'>Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='14'>She's not fourteen.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>Nurse</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='16'>And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='17'>She is not fourteen. How long is it now</span><br/>
<span id='18'>To Lammas-tide?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>                  A fortnight and odd days.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>Nurse</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Even or odd, of all days in the year,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Susan and she&mdash;God rest all Christian souls!&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;</span><br/>
<span id='24'>She was too good for me: but, as I said,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;</span><br/>
<span id='26'>That shall she, marry; I remember it well.</span><br/>
<span id='27'>'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;</span><br/>
<span id='28'>And she was wean'd,&mdash;I never shall forget it,&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='29'>Of all the days of the year, upon that day:</span><br/>
<span id='30'>For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;</span><br/>
<span id='32'>My lord and you were then at Mantua:&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='33'>Nay, I do bear a brain:&mdash;but, as I said,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>To bid me trudge:</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And since that time it is eleven years;</span><br/>
<span id='40'>For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>She could have run and waddled all about;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>For even the day before, she broke her brow:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And then my husband&mdash;God be with his soul!</span><br/>
<span id='44'>A' was a merry man&mdash;took up the child:</span><br/>
<span id='45'>'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'</span><br/>
<span id='49'>To see, now, how a jest shall come about!</span><br/>
<span id='50'>I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,</span><br/>
<span id='51'>I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>Nurse</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,</span><br/>
<span id='55'>To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'</span><br/>
<span id='56'>And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow</span><br/>
<span id='57'>A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;</span><br/>
<span id='58'>A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:</span><br/>
<span id='59'>'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>Nurse</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!</span><br/>
<span id='64'>Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:</span><br/>
<span id='65'>An I might live to see thee married once,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>I have my wish.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='67'>Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme</span><br/>
<span id='68'>I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,</span><br/>
<span id='69'>How stands your disposition to be married?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>It is an honour that I dream not of.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>Nurse</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>An honour! were not I thine only nurse,</span><br/>
<span id='72'>I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Are made already mothers: by my count,</span><br/>
<span id='76'>I was your mother much upon these years</span><br/>
<span id='77'>That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:</span><br/>
<span id='78'>The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>Nurse</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>A man, young lady! lady, such a man</span><br/>
<span id='80'>As all the world&mdash;why, he's a man of wax.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Verona's summer hath not such a flower.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>Nurse</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='82'>Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='83'>What say you? can you love the gentleman?</span><br/>
<span id='84'>This night you shall behold him at our feast;</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Examine every married lineament,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>And see how one another lends content</span><br/>
<span id='89'>And what obscured in this fair volume lies</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Find written in the margent of his eyes.</span><br/>
<span id='91'>This precious book of love, this unbound lover,</span><br/>
<span id='92'>To beautify him, only lacks a cover:</span><br/>
<span id='93'>The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride</span><br/>
<span id='94'>For fair without the fair within to hide:</span><br/>
<span id='95'>That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>So shall you share all that he doth possess,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>By having him, making yourself no less.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Nurse</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>JULIET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>I'll look to like, if looking liking move:</span><br/>
<span id='102'>But no more deep will I endart mine eye</span><br/>
<span id='103'>Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter a Servant</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>Servant</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='104'>Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you</span><br/>
<span id='105'>called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in</span><br/>
<span id='106'>the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must</span><br/>
<span id='107'>hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>LADY CAPULET</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='108'>We follow thee.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Servant</em></p>
<span id='109'>Juliet, the county stays.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>Nurse</strong></a></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>
</blockquote>

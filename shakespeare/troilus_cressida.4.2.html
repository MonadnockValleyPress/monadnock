<em>Enter TROILUS and CRESSIDA</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>TROILUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;</span><br/>
<span id='3'>He shall unbolt the gates.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>TROILUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Trouble him not;</span><br/>
<span id='5'>To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,</span><br/>
<span id='6'>And give as soft attachment to thy senses</span><br/>
<span id='7'>As infants' empty of all thought!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Good morrow, then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>TROILUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='9'>I prithee now, to bed.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Are you a-weary of me?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>TROILUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='11'>O Cressida! but that the busy day,</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>I would not from thee.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>Night hath been too brief.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>TROILUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays</span><br/>
<span id='17'>As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love</span><br/>
<span id='18'>With wings more momentary-swift than thought.</span><br/>
<span id='19'>You will catch cold, and curse me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='20'>Prithee, tarry:</span><br/>
<span id='21'>You men will never tarry.</span><br/>
<span id='22'>O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>And then you would have tarried. Hark!</span><br/>
<span id='24'>there's one up.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='25'>[Within]  What, 's all the doors open here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>TROILUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>It is your uncle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='27'>A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:</span><br/>
<span id='28'>I shall have such a life!</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter PANDARUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>How now, how now! how go maidenheads? Here, you</span><br/>
<span id='30'>maid! where's my cousin Cressid?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!</span><br/>
<span id='32'>You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>To do what? to do what? let her say</span><br/>
<span id='34'>what: what have I brought you to do?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='35'>Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Nor suffer others.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>Ha! ha! Alas, poor wretch! ah, poor capocchia!</span><br/>
<span id='38'>hast not slept to-night? would he not, a naughty</span><br/>
<span id='39'>man, let it sleep? a bugbear take him!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='40'>Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!</span><br/>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<span id='41'>Who's that at door? good uncle, go and see.</span><br/>
<span id='42'>My lord, come you again into my chamber:</span><br/>
<span id='43'>You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>TROILUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='44'>Ha, ha!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='45'>Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.</span><br/>
<p><em>Knocking within</em></p>
<span id='46'>How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>I would not for half Troy have you seen here.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt TROILUS and CRESSIDA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='48'>Who's there? what's the matter? will you beat</span><br/>
<span id='49'>down the door? How now! what's the matter?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter AENEAS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>AENEAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='50'>Good morrow, lord, good morrow.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>I knew you not: what news with you so early?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>AENEAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>Is not Prince Troilus here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Here! what should he do here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>AENEAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:</span><br/>
<span id='56'>It doth import him much to speak with me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Is he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'll</span><br/>
<span id='58'>be sworn: for my own part, I came in late. What</span><br/>
<span id='59'>should he do here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>AENEAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Who!&mdash;nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrong</span><br/>
<span id='61'>ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to be</span><br/>
<span id='62'>false to him: do not you know of him, but yet go</span><br/>
<span id='63'>fetch him hither; go.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter TROILUS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech30'><strong>TROILUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>How now! what's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech31'><strong>AENEAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='65'>My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,</span><br/>
<span id='66'>My matter is so rash: there is at hand</span><br/>
<span id='67'>Paris your brother, and Deiphobus,</span><br/>
<span id='68'>The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>We must give up to Diomedes' hand</span><br/>
<span id='72'>The Lady Cressida.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech32'><strong>TROILUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='73'>                  Is it so concluded?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech33'><strong>AENEAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>By Priam and the general state of Troy:</span><br/>
<span id='75'>They are at hand and ready to effect it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech34'><strong>TROILUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='76'>How my achievements mock me!</span><br/>
<span id='77'>I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,</span><br/>
<span id='78'>We met by chance; you did not find me here.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech35'><strong>AENEAS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='79'>Good, good, my lord; the secrets of nature</span><br/>
<span id='80'>Have not more gift in taciturnity.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt TROILUS and AENEAS</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech36'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='81'>Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The devil</span><br/>
<span id='82'>take Antenor! the young prince will go mad: a</span><br/>
<span id='83'>plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke 's neck!</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter CRESSIDA</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech37'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='84'>How now! what's the matter? who was here?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech38'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='85'>Ah, ah!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech39'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>O the gods! what's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='90'>Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been</span><br/>
<span id='91'>born! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poor</span><br/>
<span id='92'>gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='93'>Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>what's the matter?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='95'>Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou</span><br/>
<span id='96'>art changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,</span><br/>
<span id='97'>and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death;</span><br/>
<span id='98'>'twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='99'>O you immortal gods! I will not go.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>Thou must.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='101'>I will not, uncle: I have forgot my father;</span><br/>
<span id='102'>I know no touch of consanguinity;</span><br/>
<span id='103'>No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near me</span><br/>
<span id='104'>As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Do to this body what extremes you can;</span><br/>
<span id='108'>But the strong base and building of my love</span><br/>
<span id='109'>Is as the very centre of the earth,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>PANDARUS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='111'>Do, do.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>CRESSIDA</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='112'>Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart</span><br/>
<span id='114'>With sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

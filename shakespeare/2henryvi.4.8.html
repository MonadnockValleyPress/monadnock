<h1>Henry VI, Part 2</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act IV, Scene VIII</h3>
<h4>Southwark.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Alarum and retreat. Enter CADE and all his rabblement</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>CADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Up Fish Street! down Saint Magnus' Corner! Kill</span><br/>
<span id='2'>and knock down! throw them into Thames!</span><br/>
<p><em>Sound a parley</em></p>
<span id='3'>What noise is this I hear? Dare any be so bold to</span><br/>
<span id='4'>sound retreat or parley, when I command them kill?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter BUCKINGHAM and CLIFFORD, attended</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>Ay, here they be that dare and will disturb thee:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Know, Cade, we come ambassadors from the king</span><br/>
<span id='7'>Unto the commons whom thou hast misled;</span><br/>
<span id='8'>And here pronounce free pardon to them all</span><br/>
<span id='9'>That will forsake thee and go home in peace.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>What say ye, countrymen? will ye relent,</span><br/>
<span id='11'>And yield to mercy whilst 'tis offer'd you;</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths?</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Who loves the king and will embrace his pardon,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Fling up his cap, and say 'God save his majesty!'</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Who hateth him and honours not his father,</span><br/>
<span id='16'>Henry the Fifth, that made all France to quake,</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Shake he his weapon at us and pass by.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>ALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>God save the king! God save the king!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>CADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>What, Buckingham and Clifford, are ye so brave? And</span><br/>
<span id='20'>you, base peasants, do ye believe him? will you</span><br/>
<span id='21'>needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks?</span><br/>
<span id='22'>Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>that you should leave me at the White Hart in</span><br/>
<span id='24'>Southwark? I thought ye would never have given out</span><br/>
<span id='25'>these arms till you had recovered your ancient</span><br/>
<span id='26'>freedom: but you are all recreants and dastards,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>and delight to live in slavery to the nobility. Let</span><br/>
<span id='28'>them break your backs with burthens, take your</span><br/>
<span id='29'>houses over your heads, ravish your wives and</span><br/>
<span id='30'>daughters before your faces: for me, I will make</span><br/>
<span id='31'>shift for one; and so, God's curse light upon you</span><br/>
<span id='32'>all!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>ALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>We'll follow Cade, we'll follow Cade!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>CLIFFORD</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='34'>Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>That thus you do exclaim you'll go with him?</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Will he conduct you through the heart of France,</span><br/>
<span id='37'>And make the meanest of you earls and dukes?</span><br/>
<span id='38'>Alas, he hath no home, no place to fly to;</span><br/>
<span id='39'>Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>Unless by robbing of your friends and us.</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Were't not a shame, that whilst you live at jar,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>The fearful French, whom you late vanquished,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>Should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you?</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Methinks already in this civil broil</span><br/>
<span id='45'>I see them lording it in London streets,</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Crying 'Villiago!' unto all they meet.</span><br/>
<span id='47'>Better ten thousand base-born Cades miscarry</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Than you should stoop unto a Frenchman's mercy.</span><br/>
<span id='49'>To France, to France, and get what you have lost;</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Spare England, for it is your native coast;</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Henry hath money, you are strong and manly;</span><br/>
<span id='52'>God on our side, doubt not of victory.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>ALL</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='53'>A Clifford! a Clifford! we'll follow the king and Clifford.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>CADE</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this</span><br/>
<span id='55'>multitude? The name of Henry the Fifth hales them</span><br/>
<span id='56'>to an hundred mischiefs, and makes them leave me</span><br/>
<span id='57'>desolate. I see them lay their heads together to</span><br/>
<span id='58'>surprise me. My sword make way for me, for here is</span><br/>
<span id='59'>no staying. In despite of the devils and hell, have</span><br/>
<span id='60'>through the very middest of you? and heavens and</span><br/>
<span id='61'>honour be witness, that no want of resolution in me,</span><br/>
<span id='62'>but only my followers' base and ignominious</span><br/>
<span id='63'>treasons, makes me betake me to my heels.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>BUCKINGHAM</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='64'>What, is he fled? Go some, and follow him;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>And he that brings his head unto the king</span><br/>
<span id='66'>Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt some of them</em></p>
<span id='67'>Follow me, soldiers: we'll devise a mean</span><br/>
<span id='68'>To reconcile you all unto the king.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

<h1>Macbeth</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene IV</h3>
<h4>The same. Hall in the palace.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>A banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH, LADY MACBETH, ROSS, LENNOX, Lords, and Attendants</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>You know your own degrees; sit down: at first</span><br/>
<span id='2'>And last the hearty welcome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>Lords</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='3'>Thanks to your majesty.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='4'>Ourself will mingle with society,</span><br/>
<span id='5'>And play the humble host.</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time</span><br/>
<span id='7'>We will require her welcome.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;</span><br/>
<span id='9'>For my heart speaks they are welcome.</span><br/>
<p><em>First Murderer appears at the door</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:</span><br/>
<span id='12'>Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure</span><br/>
<span id='13'>The table round.</span><br/>
<p><em>Approaching the door</em></p>
<span id='14'>There's blood on thy face.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='15'>'Tis Banquo's then.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>'Tis better thee without than he within.</span><br/>
<span id='17'>Is he dispatch'd?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='18'>My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good</span><br/>
<span id='20'>That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,</span><br/>
<span id='21'>Thou art the nonpareil.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>Most royal sir,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Fleance is 'scaped.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,</span><br/>
<span id='26'>As broad and general as the casing air:</span><br/>
<span id='27'>But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in</span><br/>
<span id='28'>To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>First Murderer</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>With twenty trenched gashes on his head;</span><br/>
<span id='31'>The least a death to nature.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>Thanks for that:</span><br/>
<span id='33'>There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Hath nature that in time will venom breed,</span><br/>
<span id='35'>No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow</span><br/>
<span id='36'>We'll hear, ourselves, again.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit Murderer</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='37'>My royal lord,</span><br/>
<span id='38'>You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold</span><br/>
<span id='39'>That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,</span><br/>
<span id='40'>'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;</span><br/>
<span id='41'>From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Meeting were bare without it.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='43'>Sweet remembrancer!</span><br/>
<span id='44'>Now, good digestion wait on appetite,</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And health on both!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>LENNOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='46'>May't please your highness sit.</span><br/>
<p><em>The GHOST OF BANQUO enters, and sits in MACBETH's place</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='47'>Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,</span><br/>
<span id='48'>Were the graced person of our Banquo present;</span><br/>
<span id='49'>Who may I rather challenge for unkindness</span><br/>
<span id='50'>Than pity for mischance!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='51'>His absence, sir,</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness</span><br/>
<span id='53'>To grace us with your royal company.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='54'>The table's full.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>LENNOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='55'>                  Here is a place reserved, sir.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='56'>Where?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech22'><strong>LENNOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='57'>Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='58'>Which of you have done this?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech24'><strong>Lords</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='59'>What, my good lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech25'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='60'>Thou canst not say I did it: never shake</span><br/>
<span id='61'>Thy gory locks at me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech26'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='62'>Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='63'>Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,</span><br/>
<span id='64'>And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;</span><br/>
<span id='65'>The fit is momentary; upon a thought</span><br/>
<span id='66'>He will again be well: if much you note him,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>You shall offend him and extend his passion:</span><br/>
<span id='68'>Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech28'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='69'>Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that</span><br/>
<span id='70'>Which might appal the devil.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech29'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='71'>O proper stuff!</span><br/>
<span id='72'>This is the very painting of your fear:</span><br/>
<span id='73'>This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,</span><br/>
<span id='74'>Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,</span><br/>
<span id='75'>Impostors to true fear, would well become</span><br/>
<span id='76'>A woman's story at a winter's fire,</span><br/>
<span id='77'>Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!</span><br/>
<span id='78'>Why do you make such faces? When all's done,</span><br/>
<span id='79'>You look but on a stool.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='80'>Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!</span><br/>
<span id='81'>how say you?</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.</span><br/>
<span id='83'>If charnel-houses and our graves must send</span><br/>
<span id='84'>Those that we bury back, our monuments</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Shall be the maws of kites.</span><br/>
<p><em>GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='86'>What, quite unmann'd in folly?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='87'>If I stand here, I saw him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='88'>Fie, for shame!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='89'>Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;</span><br/>
<span id='91'>Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd</span><br/>
<span id='92'>Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,</span><br/>
<span id='93'>That, when the brains were out, the man would die,</span><br/>
<span id='94'>And there an end; but now they rise again,</span><br/>
<span id='95'>With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,</span><br/>
<span id='96'>And push us from our stools: this is more strange</span><br/>
<span id='97'>Than such a murder is.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='98'>My worthy lord,</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Your noble friends do lack you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='100'>I do forget.</span><br/>
<span id='101'>Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,</span><br/>
<span id='102'>I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing</span><br/>
<span id='103'>To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.</span><br/>
<span id='105'>I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,</span><br/>
<span id='106'>And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>And all to all.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>Lords</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='109'>                  Our duties, and the pledge.</span><br/>
<p><em>Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='110'>Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!</span><br/>
<span id='111'>Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;</span><br/>
<span id='112'>Thou hast no speculation in those eyes</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Which thou dost glare with!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='114'>Think of this, good peers,</span><br/>
<span id='115'>But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech40'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='117'>What man dare, I dare:</span><br/>
<span id='118'>Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;</span><br/>
<span id='120'>Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves</span><br/>
<span id='121'>Shall never tremble: or be alive again,</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And dare me to the desert with thy sword;</span><br/>
<span id='123'>If trembling I inhabit then, protest me</span><br/>
<span id='124'>The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!</span><br/>
<span id='125'>Unreal mockery, hence!</span><br/>
<p><em>GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes</em></p>
<span id='126'>Why, so: being gone,</span><br/>
<span id='127'>I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech41'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='128'>You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,</span><br/>
<span id='129'>With most admired disorder.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech42'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='130'>Can such things be,</span><br/>
<span id='131'>And overcome us like a summer's cloud,</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Without our special wonder? You make me strange</span><br/>
<span id='133'>Even to the disposition that I owe,</span><br/>
<span id='134'>When now I think you can behold such sights,</span><br/>
<span id='135'>And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>When mine is blanched with fear.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech43'><strong>ROSS</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='137'>What sights, my lord?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech44'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='138'>I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;</span><br/>
<span id='139'>Question enrages him. At once, good night:</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Stand not upon the order of your going,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>But go at once.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech45'><strong>LENNOX</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='142'>                  Good night; and better health</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Attend his majesty!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech46'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>A kind good night to all!</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech47'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:</span><br/>
<span id='146'>Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;</span><br/>
<span id='147'>Augurs and understood relations have</span><br/>
<span id='148'>By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth</span><br/>
<span id='149'>The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech48'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='150'>Almost at odds with morning, which is which.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech49'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='151'>How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person</span><br/>
<span id='152'>At our great bidding?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech50'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='153'>Did you send to him, sir?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech51'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='154'>I hear it by the way; but I will send:</span><br/>
<span id='155'>There's not a one of them but in his house</span><br/>
<span id='156'>I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,</span><br/>
<span id='157'>And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:</span><br/>
<span id='158'>More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,</span><br/>
<span id='159'>By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,</span><br/>
<span id='160'>All causes shall give way: I am in blood</span><br/>
<span id='161'>Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Returning were as tedious as go o'er:</span><br/>
<span id='163'>Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech52'><strong>LADY MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='165'>You lack the season of all natures, sleep.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech53'><strong>MACBETH</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='166'>Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse</span><br/>
<span id='167'>Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:</span><br/>
<span id='168'>We are yet but young in deed.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

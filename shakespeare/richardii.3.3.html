<h1>Richard II</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act III, Scene III</h3>
<h4>Wales. Before Flint castle.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter, with drum and colours, HENRY BOLINGBROKE, DUKE OF YORK, NORTHUMBERLAND, Attendants, and forces</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>So that by this intelligence we learn</span><br/>
<span id='2'>The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury</span><br/>
<span id='3'>Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed</span><br/>
<span id='4'>With some few private friends upon this coast.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='5'>The news is very fair and good, my lord:</span><br/>
<span id='6'>Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>It would beseem the Lord Northumberland</span><br/>
<span id='8'>To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day</span><br/>
<span id='9'>When such a sacred king should hide his head.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='10'>Your grace mistakes; only to be brief</span><br/>
<span id='11'>Left I his title out.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='12'>The time hath been,</span><br/>
<span id='13'>Would you have been so brief with him, he would</span><br/>
<span id='14'>Have been so brief with you, to shorten you,</span><br/>
<span id='15'>For taking so the head, your whole head's length.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='16'>Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='17'>Take not, good cousin, further than you should.</span><br/>
<span id='18'>Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='19'>I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself</span><br/>
<span id='20'>Against their will. But who comes here?</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter HENRY PERCY</em></p>
<span id='21'>Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>HENRY PERCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,</span><br/>
<span id='23'>Against thy entrance.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='24'>Royally!</span><br/>
<span id='25'>Why, it contains no king?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>HENRY PERCY</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='26'>Yes, my good lord,</span><br/>
<span id='27'>It doth contain a king; King Richard lies</span><br/>
<span id='28'>Within the limits of yon lime and stone:</span><br/>
<span id='29'>And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,</span><br/>
<span id='30'>Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman</span><br/>
<span id='31'>Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech12'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='32'>O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech13'><strong>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>Noble lords,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley</span><br/>
<span id='36'>Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:</span><br/>
<span id='37'>Henry Bolingbroke</span><br/>
<span id='38'>On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand</span><br/>
<span id='39'>And sends allegiance and true faith of heart</span><br/>
<span id='40'>To his most royal person, hither come</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,</span><br/>
<span id='42'>Provided that my banishment repeal'd</span><br/>
<span id='43'>And lands restored again be freely granted:</span><br/>
<span id='44'>If not, I'll use the advantage of my power</span><br/>
<span id='45'>And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood</span><br/>
<span id='46'>Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:</span><br/>
<span id='47'>The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke</span><br/>
<span id='48'>It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench</span><br/>
<span id='49'>The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,</span><br/>
<span id='50'>My stooping duty tenderly shall show.</span><br/>
<span id='51'>Go, signify as much, while here we march</span><br/>
<span id='52'>Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.</span><br/>
<span id='53'>Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,</span><br/>
<span id='54'>That from this castle's tatter'd battlements</span><br/>
<span id='55'>Our fair appointments may be well perused.</span><br/>
<span id='56'>Methinks King Richard and myself should meet</span><br/>
<span id='57'>With no less terror than the elements</span><br/>
<span id='58'>Of fire and water, when their thundering shock</span><br/>
<span id='59'>At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.</span><br/>
<span id='60'>Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:</span><br/>
<span id='61'>The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain</span><br/>
<span id='62'>My waters; on the earth, and not on him.</span><br/>
<span id='63'>March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.</span><br/>
<p><em>Parle without, and answer within. Then a flourish.  Enter on the walls, KING RICHARD II, the BISHOP OF  CARLISLE, DUKE OF AUMERLE, SIR STEPHEN SCROOP, and EARL OF SALISBURY</em></p>
<span id='64'>See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,</span><br/>
<span id='65'>As doth the blushing discontented sun</span><br/>
<span id='66'>From out the fiery portal of the east,</span><br/>
<span id='67'>When he perceives the envious clouds are bent</span><br/>
<span id='68'>To dim his glory and to stain the track</span><br/>
<span id='69'>Of his bright passage to the occident.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech14'><strong>DUKE OF YORK</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='70'>Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,</span><br/>
<span id='71'>As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth</span><br/>
<span id='72'>Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,</span><br/>
<span id='73'>That any harm should stain so fair a show!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech15'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='74'>We are amazed; and thus long have we stood</span><br/>
<span id='75'>To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,</span><br/>
<p><em>To NORTHUMBERLAND</em></p>
<span id='76'>Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:</span><br/>
<span id='77'>And if we be, how dare thy joints forget</span><br/>
<span id='78'>To pay their awful duty to our presence?</span><br/>
<span id='79'>If we be not, show us the hand of God</span><br/>
<span id='80'>That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;</span><br/>
<span id='81'>For well we know, no hand of blood and bone</span><br/>
<span id='82'>Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,</span><br/>
<span id='83'>Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.</span><br/>
<span id='84'>And though you think that all, as you have done,</span><br/>
<span id='85'>Have torn their souls by turning them from us,</span><br/>
<span id='86'>And we are barren and bereft of friends;</span><br/>
<span id='87'>Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,</span><br/>
<span id='88'>Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf</span><br/>
<span id='89'>Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike</span><br/>
<span id='90'>Your children yet unborn and unbegot,</span><br/>
<span id='91'>That lift your vassal hands against my head</span><br/>
<span id='92'>And threat the glory of my precious crown.</span><br/>
<span id='93'>Tell Bolingbroke&mdash;for yond methinks he stands&mdash;</span><br/>
<span id='94'>That every stride he makes upon my land</span><br/>
<span id='95'>Is dangerous treason: he is come to open</span><br/>
<span id='96'>The purple testament of bleeding war;</span><br/>
<span id='97'>But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,</span><br/>
<span id='98'>Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons</span><br/>
<span id='99'>Shall ill become the flower of England's face,</span><br/>
<span id='100'>Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace</span><br/>
<span id='101'>To scarlet indignation and bedew</span><br/>
<span id='102'>Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech16'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='103'>The king of heaven forbid our lord the king</span><br/>
<span id='104'>Should so with civil and uncivil arms</span><br/>
<span id='105'>Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin</span><br/>
<span id='106'>Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;</span><br/>
<span id='107'>And by the honourable tomb he swears,</span><br/>
<span id='108'>That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,</span><br/>
<span id='109'>And by the royalties of both your bloods,</span><br/>
<span id='110'>Currents that spring from one most gracious head,</span><br/>
<span id='111'>And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,</span><br/>
<span id='112'>And by the worth and honour of himself,</span><br/>
<span id='113'>Comprising all that may be sworn or said,</span><br/>
<span id='114'>His coming hither hath no further scope</span><br/>
<span id='115'>Than for his lineal royalties and to beg</span><br/>
<span id='116'>Enfranchisement immediate on his knees:</span><br/>
<span id='117'>Which on thy royal party granted once,</span><br/>
<span id='118'>His glittering arms he will commend to rust,</span><br/>
<span id='119'>His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart</span><br/>
<span id='120'>To faithful service of your majesty.</span><br/>
<span id='121'>This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;</span><br/>
<span id='122'>And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech17'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='123'>Northumberland, say thus the king returns:</span><br/>
<span id='124'>His noble cousin is right welcome hither;</span><br/>
<span id='125'>And all the number of his fair demands</span><br/>
<span id='126'>Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:</span><br/>
<span id='127'>With all the gracious utterance thou hast</span><br/>
<span id='128'>Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.</span><br/>
<p><em>To DUKE OF AUMERLE</em></p>
<span id='129'>We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,</span><br/>
<span id='130'>To look so poorly and to speak so fair?</span><br/>
<span id='131'>Shall we call back Northumberland, and send</span><br/>
<span id='132'>Defiance to the traitor, and so die?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech18'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='133'>No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words</span><br/>
<span id='134'>Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech19'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='135'>O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,</span><br/>
<span id='136'>That laid the sentence of dread banishment</span><br/>
<span id='137'>On yon proud man, should take it off again</span><br/>
<span id='138'>With words of sooth! O that I were as great</span><br/>
<span id='139'>As is my grief, or lesser than my name!</span><br/>
<span id='140'>Or that I could forget what I have been,</span><br/>
<span id='141'>Or not remember what I must be now!</span><br/>
<span id='142'>Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,</span><br/>
<span id='143'>Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech20'><strong>DUKE OF AUMERLE</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='144'>Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech21'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='145'>What must the king do now? must he submit?</span><br/>
<span id='146'>The king shall do it: must he be deposed?</span><br/>
<span id='147'>The king shall be contented: must he lose</span><br/>
<span id='148'>The name of king? o' God's name, let it go:</span><br/>
<span id='149'>I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,</span><br/>
<span id='150'>My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,</span><br/>
<span id='151'>My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,</span><br/>
<span id='152'>My figured goblets for a dish of wood,</span><br/>
<span id='153'>My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,</span><br/>
<span id='154'>My subjects for a pair of carved saints</span><br/>
<span id='155'>And my large kingdom for a little grave,</span><br/>
<span id='156'>A little little grave, an obscure grave;</span><br/>
<span id='157'>Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,</span><br/>
<span id='158'>Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet</span><br/>
<span id='159'>May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;</span><br/>
<span id='160'>For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;</span><br/>
<span id='161'>And buried once, why not upon my head?</span><br/>
<span id='162'>Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!</span><br/>
<span id='163'>We'll make foul weather with despised tears;</span><br/>
<span id='164'>Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,</span><br/>
<span id='165'>And make a dearth in this revolting land.</span><br/>
<span id='166'>Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,</span><br/>
<span id='167'>And make some pretty match with shedding tears?</span><br/>
<span id='168'>As thus, to drop them still upon one place,</span><br/>
<span id='169'>Till they have fretted us a pair of graves</span><br/>
<span id='170'>Within the earth; and, therein laid,&mdash;there lies</span><br/>
<span id='171'>Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.</span><br/>
<span id='172'>Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see</span><br/>
<span id='173'>I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span id='174'>Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,</span><br/>
<span id='175'>What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty</span><br/>
<span id='176'>Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?</span><br/>
<span id='177'>You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.</span><br/>

<span id='178'>My lord, in the base court he doth attend</span><br/>
<span id='179'>To speak with you; may it please you to come down.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech23'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='180'>Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,</span><br/>
<span id='181'>Wanting the manage of unruly jades.</span><br/>
<span id='182'>In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,</span><br/>
<span id='183'>To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.</span><br/>
<span id='184'>In the base court? Come down? Down, court!</span><br/>
<span id='185'>down, king!</span><br/>
<span id='186'>For night-owls shriek where mounting larks</span><br/>
<span id='187'>should sing.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exeunt from above</em></p>

<span id='speech25'><strong>NORTHUMBERLAND</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='189'>Sorrow and grief of heart</span><br/>
<span id='190'>Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man</span><br/>
<span id='191'>Yet he is come.</span><br/>
<p><em>Enter KING RICHARD and his attendants below</em></p>

<span id='194'>My gracious lord,&mdash;</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech27'><strong>KING RICHARD II</strong></a>
<blockquote>
<span id='195'>Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee</span><br/>
<span id='196'>To make the base earth proud with kissing it:</span><br/>
<span id='197'>Me rather had my heart might feel your love</span><br/>
<span id='198'>Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.</span><br/>
<span id='199'>Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,</span><br/>
<span id='200'>Thus high at least, although your knee be low.</span><br/>

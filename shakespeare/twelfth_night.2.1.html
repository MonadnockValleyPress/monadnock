<h1>Twelfth Night</h1>
<h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
<h3>Act II, Scene I</h3>
<h4>The sea-coast.</h4>

<blockquote>
<em>Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN</em>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech1'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='1'>Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech2'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='2'>By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over</span><br/>
<span id='3'>me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps</span><br/>
<span id='4'>distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your</span><br/>
<span id='5'>leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad</span><br/>
<span id='6'>recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech3'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='7'>Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech4'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='8'>No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere</span><br/>
<span id='9'>extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a</span><br/>
<span id='10'>touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me</span><br/>
<span id='11'>what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges</span><br/>
<span id='12'>me in manners the rather to express myself. You</span><br/>
<span id='13'>must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,</span><br/>
<span id='14'>which I called Roderigo. My father was that</span><br/>
<span id='15'>Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard</span><br/>
<span id='16'>of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both</span><br/>
<span id='17'>born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,</span><br/>
<span id='18'>would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;</span><br/>
<span id='19'>for some hour before you took me from the breach of</span><br/>
<span id='20'>the sea was my sister drowned.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech5'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='21'>Alas the day!</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech6'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='22'>A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled</span><br/>
<span id='23'>me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,</span><br/>
<span id='24'>though I could not with such estimable wonder</span><br/>
<span id='25'>overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly</span><br/>
<span id='26'>publish her; she bore a mind that envy could not but</span><br/>
<span id='27'>call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt</span><br/>
<span id='28'>water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech7'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='29'>Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech8'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='30'>O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech9'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='31'>If you will not murder me for my love, let me be</span><br/>
<span id='32'>your servant.</span><br/>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech10'><strong>SEBASTIAN</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='33'>If you will not undo what you have done, that is,</span><br/>
<span id='34'>kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.</span><br/>
<span id='35'>Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,</span><br/>
<span id='36'>and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that</span><br/>
<span id='37'>upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell</span><br/>
<span id='38'>tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>
</blockquote>

<span id='speech11'><strong>ANTONIO</strong></span>
<blockquote>
<span id='39'>The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!</span><br/>
<span id='40'>I have many enemies in Orsino's court,</span><br/>
<span id='41'>Else would I very shortly see thee there.</span><br/>
<span id='42'>But, come what may, I do adore thee so,</span><br/>
<span id='43'>That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.</span><br/>
<p><em>Exit</em></p>

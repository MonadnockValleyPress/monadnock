<h1>De Finibus</h1>
<h2>by Cicero</h2>
<h2>Second Book</h2>
<h3>Chapter VIII</h3>
<p>What then is the use of saying, I should have nothing to reproach them with if they only set bounds to their appetites? This is the same as saying, I should not blame debauched men if they were not debauched men. In the same way one might say, I should not blame even wicked men if they were virtuous. This man of strict morality does not think luxury of itself a thing to be blamed. And, indeed, O Torquatus, to speak the truth, if pleasure is the chief good, he is quite right not to think so. For I should be sorry to picture to myself, (as you are in the habit of doing,) men so debauched as to vomit over the table and be carried away from banquets, and then the next day, while still suffering from indigestion, gorge themselves again; men who, as they say, have never in their lives seen the sun set or rise, and who, having devoured their patrimony, are reduced to indigence. None of us imagine that debauched men of that sort live pleasantly. You, however, rather mean to speak of refined and elegant bons vivans, men who, by the employment of the most skilful cooks and bakers, and by carefully culling the choicest products of fishermen, fowlers, and hunters, avoid all indigestion&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>Men who draw richer wines from foaming casks.</blockquote>
<p>As Lucilius says, men who </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
So strain, so cool the rosy wine with snow,<br/>
That all the flavour still remains uninjured&mdash;<br/>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so on&mdash;men in the enjoyment of luxuries such that, if they are taken away, Epicurus says that he does not know what there is that can be called good. Let them also have beautiful boys to attend upon them; let their clothes, their plate, their articles of Corinthian vertu, the banqueting-room itself, all correspond, still I should never be induced to say that these men so devoted to luxury were living either well or happily. From which it follows, not indeed that pleasure is not pleasure, but that pleasure is not the chief good. Nor was Lælius, who, when a young man, was a pupil of Diogenes the Stoic, and afterwards of Panætius, called a wise man because he did not understand what was most pleasant to the taste, (for it does not follow that the man who has a discerning heart must necessarily have a palate destitute of discernment,) but because he thought it of but small importance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
O sorrel, how that man may boast himself,<br/>
By whom you're known and valued! Proud of you,<br/>
That wise man Lælius would loudly shout,<br/>
Addressing all our epicures in order.<br/>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it was well said by Lælius, and he may be truly called a wise man,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You Publius, Gallonius, you whirlpool,<br/>
You are a miserable man; you never<br/>
In all your life have really feasted well,<br/>
Though spending all your substance on those prawns,<br/>
And overgrown huge sturgeons.<br/>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man who says this is one who, as he attributes no importance to pleasure himself, denies that the man feasts well who refers everything to pleasure. And yet he does not deny that Gallonius has at times feasted as he wished: for that wouldbe speaking untruly: he only denies that he has ever feasted well. With such dignity and severe principle does he distinguish between pleasure and good. And the natural inference is, that all who feast well feast as they wish, but that it does not follow that all who feast as they wish do therefore feast well. Lælius always feasted well. How so? Lucilius shall tell you&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>He feasted on well season'd, well arranged&mdash;</blockquote>
<p>what? What was the chief part of his supper?</p>
<blockquote>Converse of prudent men,&mdash;</blockquote>
<p>Well, and what else?</p>
<blockquote>with cheerful mind.</blockquote>
<p>For he came to a banquet with a tranquil mind, desirous only of appeasing the wants of nature. Lælius then is quite right to deny that Gallonius had ever feasted well; he is quite right to call him miserable; especially as he devoted the whole of his attention to that point. And yet no one affirms that he did not sup as he wished. Why then did he not feast well? Because feasting well is feasting with propriety, frugality, and good order; but this man was in the habit of feasting badly, that is, in a dissolute, profligate, gluttonous, unseemly manner. Lælius, then, was not preferring the flavour of sorrel to Gallonius's sturgeon, but merely treating the taste of the sturgeon with indifference; which he would not have done if he had placed the chief good in pleasure.</p>

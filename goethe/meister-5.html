<h1>Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship</h1>
<h2>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</h2>
<h3>Translated by Thomas Carlyle (1839)</h3>
<h3>BOOK V</h3>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>Thus Wilhelm, to his pair of former wounds, which were yet scarcely
healed, had now got the accession of a third, which was fresh and not a
little disagreeable. Aurelia would not suffer him to call a surgeon: she
dressed the hand with all manner of strange speeches, saws, and
ceremonies, and so placed him in a very painful situation. Yet not he
alone, but all persons who came near her, suffered by her restlessness
and singularity, and no one more than little Felix. This stirring child
was exceedingly impatient under such oppression, and showed himself
still naughtier the more she censured and instructed him.</p>

<p>He delighted in some practices which commonly are thought bad habits,
and in which she would not by any means indulge him. He would drink, for
example, rather from the bottle than the glass; and his food seemed
visibly to have a better relish when eaten from the bowl than from the
plate. Such ill-breeding was not overlooked: if he left the door
standing open, or slammed it to; if, when bid do any thing, he stood
stock-still, or ran off violently,&mdash;he was sure to have a long
lecture inflicted on him for the fault. Yet he showed no symptoms of
improvement from this training: on the other hand, his affection for
Aurelia seemed daily to diminish; there was nothing tender in his tone
when he called her mother; whereas he passionately clung to the old
nurse, who let him have his will in every thing.</p>

<p>But she likewise had of late become so sick, that they had at last been
obliged to take her from the house into a quiet lodging; and Felix would
have been entirely alone if Mignon had not, like a kindly guardian
spirit, come to help him. The two children talked together, and amused
each other in the prettiest style. She taught him little songs; and he,
having an excellent memory, frequently recited them, to the surprise of
those about him. She attempted also to explain her maps to him. With
these she was still very busy, though she did not seem to take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
fittest method. For, in studying countries, she appeared to care little
about any other point than whether they were cold or warm. Of the north
and south poles, of the horrid ice which reigns there, and of the
increasing heat the farther one retires from them, she could give a very
clear account. When any one was travelling, she merely asked whether he
was going northward or southward, and strove to find his route in her
little charts. Especially when Wilhelm spoke of travelling, she was all
attention, and seemed vexed when any thing occurred to change the
subject. Though she could not be prevailed upon to undertake a part, or
even to enter the theatre when any play was acting, yet she willingly
and zealously committed many odes and songs to memory; and by
unexpectedly, and, as it were, on the spur of the moment, reciting some
such poem, generally of the earnest and solemn kind, she would often
cause astonishment in every one.</p>

<p>Serlo, accustomed to regard with favor every trace of opening talent,
encouraged her in such performances; but what pleased him most in Mignon
was her sprightly, various, and often even mirthful, singing. By means
of a similar gift, the harper likewise had acquired his favor.</p>

<p>Without himself possessing genius for music, or playing on any
instrument, Serlo could rightly prize the value of the art: he failed
not, as often as he could, to enjoy this pleasure, which cannot be
compared with any other. He held a concert once a week; and now, with
Mignon, the harper, and Laertes, who was not unskilful on the violin, he
had formed a very curious domestic band.</p>

<p>He was wont to say, "Men are so inclined to content themselves with what
is commonest; the spirit and the senses so easily grow dead to the
impressions of the beautiful and perfect,&mdash;that every one should
study, by all methods, to nourish in his mind the faculty of feeling
these things. For no man can bear to be entirely deprived of such
enjoyments: it is only because they are not used to taste of what is
excellent that the generality of people take delight in silly and
insipid things, provided they be new. For this reason," he would add,
"one ought, every day at least, to hear a little song, read a good poem,
see a fine picture, and, if it were possible, to speak a few reasonable
words." With such a turn of thought in Serlo, which in some degree was
natural to him, the persons who frequented his society could scarcely
be in want of pleasant conversation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in the midst of these instructive entertainments, that Wilhelm
one day received a letter sealed in black. Werner's hand betokened
mournful news; and our friend was not a little shocked when, opening the
sheet, he found it to contain the tidings of his father's death,
conveyed in a very few words. After a short and sudden illness, he had
parted from the world, leaving his domestic affairs in the best possible
order.</p>

<p>This unlooked-for intelligence struck Wilhelm to the heart. He deeply
felt how careless and negligent we often are of friends and relations
while they inhabit with us this terrestrial sojourn; and how we first
repent of our insensibility when the fair union, at least for this side
of time, is finally cut asunder. His grief for the early death of this
honest parent was mitigated only by the feeling that he had loved but
little in the world, and the conviction that he had enjoyed but little.</p>

<p>Wilhelm's thoughts soon turned to his own predicament, and he felt
himself extremely discomposed. A person can scarcely be put into a more
dangerous position, than when external circumstances have produced some
striking change in his condition, without his manner of feeling and of
thinking having undergone any preparation for it. There is, then, an
epoch without epoch; and the contradiction which arises is the greater
the less the person feels that he is not trained for this new manner of
existence.</p>

<p>Wilhelm saw himself in freedom, at a moment when he could not yet be at
one with himself. His thoughts were noble, his motives pure, his
purposes were not to be despised. All this he could, with some degree of
confidence, acknowledge to himself: but he had of late been frequently
enough compelled to notice, that experience was sadly wanting to him;
and hence, on the experience of others, and on the results which they
deduced from it, he put a value far beyond its real one, and thus led
himself still deeper into error. What he wanted, he conceived he might
most readily acquire if he undertook to collect and retain whatever
memorable thought he should meet with in reading or in conversation. He
accordingly recorded his own or other men's opinions, nay, wrote whole
dialogues, when they chanced to interest him. But unhappily by this
means he held fast the false no less firmly than the true; he dwelt far
too long on one idea, particularly when it was of an aphoristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
shape; and thus he left his natural mode of thought and action, and
frequently took foreign lights for his loadstars. Aurelia's bitterness,
and Laertes's cold contempt for men, warped his judgment oftener than
they should have done: but no one, in his present case, would have been
so dangerous as Jarno, a man whose clear intellect could form a just
and rigorous decision about present things, but who erred, withal,
in enunciating these particular decisions with a kind of universal
application; whereas, in truth, the judgments of the understanding are
properly of force but once, and that in the strictest cases, and become
inaccurate in some degree when applied to any other.</p>

<p>Thus Wilhelm, striving to become consistent with himself, was deviating
farther and farther from wholesome consistency; and this confusion made
it easier for his passions to employ their whole artillery against him,
and thus still farther to perplex his views of duty.</p>

<p>Serlo did not fail to take advantage of the late tidings; and in truth
he daily had more reason to be anxious about some fresh arrangement of
his people. Either he must soon renew his old contracts,&mdash;a measure
he was not specially fond of; for several of his actors, who reckoned
themselves indispensable, were growing more and more arrogant,&mdash;or
else he must entirely new-model and re-form his company; which plan he
looked upon as preferable.</p>

<p>Though he did not personally importune our friend, he set Aurelia and
Philina on him; and the other wanderers, longing for some kind of
settlement, on their side, gave Wilhelm not a moment's rest; so that he
stood hesitating in his choice, in no slight embarrassment till he
should decide. Who would have thought that a letter of Werner's, written
with quite different views, should have forced him on resolving? We
shall omit the introduction, and give the rest of it with little
alteration.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>"It was, therefore, and it always must be, right for every one, on any
opportunity, to follow his vocation and exhibit his activity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Scarcely had the good old man been gone a quarter of an hour, when every
thing in the house began moving by a different plan than his. Friends,
acquaintances, relations, crowded forward, especially all sorts of
people who on such occasions use to gain any thing. They fetched and
carried, they counted, wrote, and reckoned; some brought wine and meat,
others ate and drank; and none seemed busier than the women getting out
the mournings.</p>

<p>"Such being the case, thou wilt not blame me, that, in this emergency, I
likewise thought of <i>my</i> advantage. I made myself as active, and as
helpful to thy sister, as I could, and, so soon as it was any way
decorous, signified to her that it had now become our business to
accelerate a union which our parents, in their too great circumspection,
had hitherto postponed.</p>

<p>"Do not suppose, however, that it came into our heads to take possession
of that monstrous empty house. We are more modest and more rational.
Thou shalt hear our plan: thy sister, so soon as we are married, comes
to our house; and thy mother comes along with her. 'How can that be?'
thou wilt say: 'you have scarcely room for yourselves in that hampered
nest.' There lies the art of it, my friend. Good packing renders all
things possible: thou wouldst not believe what space one finds when one
desires to occupy but little. The large house we shall sell,&mdash;an
opportunity occurs for this; and the money we shall draw for it will
produce a hundred-fold.</p>

<p>"I hope this meets thy views: I hope also thou hast not inherited the
smallest particle of those unprofitable tastes for which thy father and
thy grandfather were noted. The latter placed his greatest happiness in
having about him a multitude of dull-looking works of art, which no one,
I may well say no one, could enjoy with him: the former lived in a
stately pomp, which he suffered no one to enjoy with him. We mean to
manage otherwise, and we expect thy approbation.</p>

<p>"It is true, I myself in all the house have no place whatever but the
stool before my writing-desk; and I see not clearly where they will be
able to put a cradle down: but, in return, the room we shall have out of
doors will be the more abundant. Coffee-houses and clubs for the
husband, walks and drives for the wife, and pleasant country jaunts for
both. But the chief advantage in our plan is, that, the round table
being now completely filled, our father cannot ask his friends to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
dinner, who, the more he strove to entertain them, used to laugh at him
the more.</p>

<p>"Now no superfluity for us! Not too much furniture and apparatus; no
coach, no horses! Nothing but money, and the liberty, day after day, to
do what you like in reason. No wardrobe; still the best and newest on
your back: the man may wear his coat till it is done; the wife may truck
her gown, the moment it is going out of fashion. There is nothing so
unsufferable to me as an old huckster's shop of property. If you would
offer me a jewel, on condition of my wearing it daily on my finger, I
would not accept it; for how can one conceive any pleasure in a dead
capital? This, then, is my confession of faith: To transact your
business, to make money, to be merry with your household; and about the
rest of the earth to trouble yourself no farther than where you can be
of service to it.</p>

<p>"But ere now thou art saying, 'And, pray, what is to be done with me in
this sage plan of yours? Where shall I find shelter when you have sold
my own house, and not the smallest room remains in yours?'</p>

<p>"This is, in truth, the main point, brother; and in this, too, I shall
have it in my power to serve thee. But first I must present the just
tribute of my praise for time so spent as thine has been.</p>

<p>"Tell me, how hast thou within a few weeks become so skilled in every
useful, interesting object? Highly as I thought of thy powers, I did not
reckon such attention and such diligence among the number. Thy journal
shows us with what profit thou art travelling. The description of the
iron and the copper forges is exquisite: it evinces a complete knowledge
of the subject. I myself was once there; but my relation, compared with
this, has but a very bungled look. The whole letter on the linen-trade
is full of information: the remarks on commercial competition are at
once just and striking. In one or two places, there are errors in
addition, which indeed are very pardonable.</p>

<p>"But what most delights my father and myself, is thy thorough knowledge
of husbandry, and the improvement of landed property. We have thoughts
of purchasing a large estate, at present under sequestration, in a very
fruitful district. For paying it, we mean to use the money realized by
the sale of the house; another portion we shall borrow; a portion may
remain unpaid. And we count on thee for going thither, and superintending
the improvement of it; by which means, before many years are passed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the land, to speak in moderation, will have risen above a third in
value. We shall then bring it to the market again, seek out a larger
piece, improve and trade as formerly. For all this thou art the man. Our
pens, meanwhile, will not lie idle here; and so by and by we shall rise
to be enviable people.</p>

<p>"For the present, fare thee well! Enjoy life on thy journey, and turn
thy face wherever thou canst find contentment and advantage. For the
next half-year we shall not need thee; thou canst look about thee in the
world as thou pleasest: a judicious person finds his best instruction in
his travels. Farewell! I rejoice at being connected with thee so closely
by relation, and now united with thee in the spirit of activity."</p>

<hr class="hr" />

<p>Well as this letter might be penned, and full of economical truths as it
was, Wilhelm felt displeased with it for more than one reason. The
praise bestowed on him for his pretended statistical, technological, and
rural knowledge was a silent reprimand. The ideal of the happiness of
civic life, which his worthy brother sketched, by no means charmed him:
on the contrary, a secret spirit of contradiction dragged him forcibly
the other way. He convinced himself, that, except on the stage, he could
nowhere find that mental culture which he longed to give himself: he
seemed to grow the more decided in his resolution, the more strongly
Werner, without knowing it, opposed him. Thus assailed, he collected all
his arguments together, and buttressed his opinions in his mind the more
carefully, the more desirable he reckoned it to show them in a favorable
light to Werner; and in this manner he produced an answer, which also we
insert.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>"Thy letter is so well written, and so prudently and wisely conceived,
that no objection can be made to it. Only thou must pardon me, when I
declare that one may think, maintain, and do directly the reverse, and
yet be in the right as well as thou. Thy mode of being and imagining
appears to turn on boundless acquisition, and a light, mirthful manner
of enjoyment: I need scarcely tell thee, that in all this I find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
little that can charm me.</p>

<p>"First, however, I am sorry to admit, that my journal is none of mine.
Under the pressure of necessity, and to satisfy my father, it was
patched together by a friend's help, out of many books: and though in
words I know the objects it relates to, and more of the like sort, I by
no means understand them, or can occupy myself about them. What good
were it for me to manufacture perfect iron while my own breast is full
of dross? What would it stead me to put properties of land in order,
while I am at variance with myself?</p>

<p>"To speak it in a word, the cultivation of my individual self, here as I
am, has from my youth upwards been constantly though dimly my wish and
my purpose. The same intention I still cherish, but the means of
realizing it are now grown somewhat clearer. I have seen more of life
than thou believest, and profited more by it also. Give some attention,
then, to what I say, though it should not altogether tally with thy own
opinions.</p>

<p>"Had I been a nobleman, our dispute would soon have been decided; but,
being a simple burgher, I must take a path of my own: and I fear it may
be difficult to make thee understand me. I know not how it is in foreign
countries, but in Germany, a universal, and, if I may say so, personal,
cultivation is beyond the reach of any one except a nobleman. A burgher
may acquire merit; by excessive efforts he may even educate his mind;
but his personal qualities are lost, or worse than lost, let him
struggle as he will. Since the nobleman, frequenting the society of the
most polished, is compelled to give himself a polished manner; since
this manner, neither door nor gate being shut against him, grows at last
an unconstrained one; since, in court or camp, his figure, his person,
are a part of his possessions, and, it may be, the most necessary
part,&mdash;he has reason enough to put some value on them, and to show
that he puts some. A certain stately grace in common things, a sort of
gay elegance in earnest and important ones, becomes him well; for it
shows him to be everywhere in equilibrium. He is a public person; and
the more cultivated his movements, the more sonorous his voice, the more
staid and measured his whole being is, the more perfect is he. If to
high and low, to friends and relations, he continues still the same,
then nothing can be said against him, none may wish him otherwise. His
coldness must be reckoned clearness of head, his dissimulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
prudence. If he can rule himself externally at every moment of his life,
no man has aught more to demand of him; and, whatever else there may be
in him or about him, capacities, talents, wealth, all seem gifts of
supererogation.</p>

<p>"Now, imagine any burgher offering ever to pretend to these advantages,
he will utterly fail, and the more completely, the greater inclination
and the more endowments nature may have given him for that mode of
being.</p>

<p>"Since, in common life, the nobleman is hampered by no limits; since
kings, or kinglike figures, do not differ from him,&mdash;he can
everywhere advance with a silent consciousness, as if before his equals:
everywhere he is entitled to press forward, whereas nothing more beseems
the burgher than the quiet feeling of the limits that are drawn round
him. The burgher may not ask himself, 'What art thou?' He can only ask,
'What hast thou? What discernment, knowledge, talent, wealth?' If the
nobleman, merely by his personal carriage, offers all that can be asked
of him, the burgher by his personal carriage offers nothing, and can
offer nothing. The former has a right to <i>seem</i>: the latter is compelled
to <i>be</i>, and what he aims at seeming becomes ludicrous and tasteless.
The former does and makes, the latter but effects and procures; he must
cultivate some single gifts in order to be useful; and it is beforehand
settled, that, in his manner of existence, there is no harmony, and can
be none, since he is bound to make himself of use in one department, and
so has to relinquish all the others.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the reason of this difference is not the usurpation of the
nobles, and the submission of the burghers, but the constitution of
society itself. Whether it will ever alter, and how, is to me of small
importance: my present business is to meet my own case, as matters
actually stand; to consider by what means I may save myself, and reach
the object which I cannot live in peace without.</p>

<p>"Now, this harmonious cultivation of my nature, which has been denied me
by birth, is exactly what I most long for. Since leaving thee, I have
gained much by voluntary practice: I have laid aside much of my wonted
embarrassment, and can bear myself in very tolerable style. My speech
and voice I have likewise been attending to; and I may say, without much
vanity, that in society I do not cause displeasure. But I will not
conceal from thee, that my inclination to become a public person, and to
please and influence in a larger circle, is daily growing more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
insuperable. With this, there is combined my love for poetry and all
that is related to it; and the necessity I feel to cultivate my mental
faculties and tastes, that so, in this enjoyment henceforth
indispensable, I may esteem as good the good alone, as beautiful the
beautiful alone. Thou seest well, that for me all this is nowhere to be
met with except upon the stage; that in this element alone can I effect
and cultivate myself according to my wishes. On the boards a polished
man appears in his splendor with personal accomplishments, just as he
does so in the upper classes of society; body and spirit must advance
with equal steps in all his studies; and there I shall have it in my
power at once to be and seem as well as anywhere. If I further long for
solid occupations, we have there mechanical vexations in abundance: I
may give my patience daily exercise.</p>

<p>"Dispute not with me on this subject; for, ere thou writest, the step is
taken. In compliance with the ruling prejudices, I will change my name;
as, indeed, that of Meister, or Master, does not suit me. Farewell! Our
fortune is in good hands: on that subject I shall not disturb myself.
What I need I will, as occasion calls, require from thee: it will not be
much, for I hope my art will be sufficient to maintain me."</p>

<hr class="hr" />

<p>Scarcely was the letter sent away, when our friend made good his words.
To the great surprise of Serlo and the rest, he at once declared that he
was ready to become an actor, and bind himself by a contract on
reasonable terms. With regard to these they were soon agreed; for Serlo
had before made offers, with which Wilhelm and his comrades had good
reason to be satisfied. The whole of that unlucky company, wherewith we
have had so long to occupy ourselves, was now at once received; and,
except perhaps Laertes, not a member of it showed the smallest
thankfulness to Wilhelm. As they had entreated without confidence, so
they accepted without gratitude. Most of them preferred ascribing their
appointment to the influence of Philina, and directed their thanks to
her. Meanwhile the contracts had been written out, and were now
a-signing. At the moment when our friend was subscribing his assumed
designation, by some inexplicable concatenation of ideas, there arose
before his mind's eye the image of that green in the forest where he lay
wounded in Philina's lap. The lovely Amazon came riding on her gray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
palfrey from the bushes of the wood: she approached him and dismounted.
Her humane anxiety made her come and go: at length she stood before him.
The white surtout fell down from her shoulders: her countenance, her
form, began to glance in radiance: and she vanished from his sight. He
wrote his name mechanically only, not knowing what he did, and felt not,
till after he had signed, that Mignon was standing at his side, was
holding by his arm, and had softly tried to stop him, and pull back his
hand.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>One of the conditions under which our friend had gone upon the stage was
not acceded to by Serlo without some limitations. Wilhelm had required
that "Hamlet" should be played entire and unmutilated: the other had
agreed to this strange stipulation, in so far as it was <i>possible</i>. On
this point they had many a contest; for as to what was possible or not
possible, and what parts of the piece could be omitted without
mutilating it, the two were of very different opinions.</p>

<p>Wilhelm was still in that happy season when one cannot understand how,
in the woman one loves, in the writer one honors, there should be any
thing defective. The feeling they excite in us is so entire, so
accordant with itself, that we cannot help attributing the same perfect
harmony to the objects themselves. Serlo again was willing to
discriminate, perhaps too willing: his acute understanding could usually
discern in any work of art nothing but a more or less imperfect whole.
He thought, that as pieces usually stood, there was little reason to be
chary about meddling with them; that of course Shakspeare, and
particularly "Hamlet," would need to suffer much curtailment.</p>

<p>But, when Serlo talked of separating the wheat from the chaff, Wilhelm
would not hear of it. "It is not chaff and wheat together," said he: "it
is a trunk with boughs, twigs, leaves, buds, blossoms, and fruit. Is not
the one there with the others, and by means of them?" To which Serlo
would reply, that people did not bring a whole tree upon the table; that
the artist was required to present his guests with silver apples in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
platters of silver. They exhausted their invention in similitudes, and
their opinions seemed still farther to diverge.</p>

<p>Our friend was on the borders of despair, when on one occasion, after
much debating, Serlo counselled him to take the simple plan,&mdash;to
make a brief resolution, to grasp his pen, to peruse the tragedy;
dashing out whatever would not answer, compressing several personages
into one: and if he was not skilled in such proceedings, or had not
heart enough for going through with them, he might leave the task to
him, the manager, who would engage to make short work with it.</p>

<p>"That is not our bargain," answered Wilhelm. "How can you, with all your
taste, show so much levity?"</p>

<p>"My friend," cried Serlo, "you yourself will erelong feel it and show
it. I know too well how shocking such a mode of treating works is:
perhaps it never was allowed on any theatre till now. But where, indeed,
was ever one so slighted as ours? Authors force us on this wretched
clipping system, and the public tolerates it. How many pieces have we,
pray, which do not overstep the measure of our numbers, of our
decorations and theatrical machinery, of the proper time, of the fit
alternation of dialogue, and the physical strength of the actor? And yet
we are to play, and play, and constantly give novelties. Ought we not to
profit by our privilege, then, since we accomplish just as much by
mutilated works as by entire ones? It is the public itself that grants
the privilege. Few Germans, perhaps few men of any modern nation, have a
proper sense of an æsthetic whole:&mdash;they praise and blame by
passages; they are charmed by passages; and who has greater reason to
rejoice at this than actors, since the stage is ever but a patched and
piece-work matter?"</p>

<p>"Is!" cried Wilhelm; "but <i>must</i> it ever be so? Must every thing that is
continue? Convince me not that you are right, for no power on earth
should force me to abide by any contract which I had concluded with the
grossest misconceptions."</p>

<p>Serlo gave a merry turn to the business, and persuaded Wilhelm to review
once more the many conversations they had had together about "Hamlet,"
and himself to invent some means of properly re-forming the piece.</p>

<p>After a few days, which he had spent alone, our friend returned with a
cheerful look. "I am much mistaken," cried he, "if I have not now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
discovered how the whole is to be managed: nay, I am convinced that
Shakspeare himself would have arranged it so, had not his mind been too
exclusively directed to the ruling interest, and perhaps misled by the
novels which furnished him with his materials."</p>

<p>"Let us hear," said Serlo, placing himself with an air of solemnity upon
the sofa: "I will listen calmly, but judge with rigor."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of you," said Wilhelm: "only hear me. In the
composition of this play, after the most accurate investigation and the
most mature reflection, I distinguish two classes of objects. The first
are the grand internal relations of the persons and events, the powerful
effects which arise from the characters and proceedings of the main
figures: these, I hold, are individually excellent; and the order in
which they are presented cannot be improved. No kind of interference
must be suffered to destroy them, or even essentially to change their
form. These are the things which stamp themselves deep into the soul,
which all men long to see, which no one dares to meddle with.
Accordingly, I understand, they have almost wholly been retained in all
our German theatres. But our countrymen have erred, in my opinion, with
regard to the second class of objects, which may be observed in this
tragedy: I allude to the external relations of the persons, whereby they
are brought from place to place, or combined in various ways, by certain
accidental incidents. These they have looked upon as very unimportant;
have spoken of them only in passing, or left them out altogether. Now,
indeed, it must be owned, these threads are slack and slender; yet they
run through the entire piece, and bind together much that would
otherwise fall asunder, and does actually fall asunder, when you cut
them off, and imagine you have done enough and more, if you have left
the ends hanging.</p>

<p>"Among these external relations I include the disturbances in Norway,
the war with young Fortinbras, the embassy to his uncle, the settling of
that feud, the march of young Fortinbras to Poland, and his coming back
at the end; of the same sort are Horatio's return from Wittenberg,
Hamlet's wish to go thither, the journey of Laertes to France, his
return, the despatch of Hamlet into England, his capture by pirates, the
death of the two courtiers by the letter which they carried. All these
circumstances and events would be very fit for expanding and lengthening
a novel; but here they injure exceedingly the unity of the piece,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
particularly as the hero has no plan, and are, in consequence, entirely
out of place."</p>

<p>"For once in the right!" cried Serlo.</p>

<p>"Do not interrupt me," answered Wilhelm: "perhaps you will not always
think me right. These errors are like temporary props of an edifice:
they must not be removed till we have built a firm wall in their stead.
My project, therefore, is, not at all to change those first-mentioned
grand situations, or at least as much as possible to spare them, both
collectively and individually; but with respect to these external,
single, dissipated, and dissipating motives, to cast them all at once
away, and substitute a solitary one instead of them."</p>

<p>"And this?" inquired Serlo, springing up from his recumbent posture.</p>

<p>"It lies in the piece itself," answered Wilhelm, "only I employ it
rightly. There are disturbances in Norway. You shall hear my plan, and
try it."</p>

<p>"After the death of Hamlet the father, the Norwegians, lately conquered,
grow unruly. The viceroy of that country sends his son, Horatio, an old
school-friend of Hamlet's, and distinguished above every other for his
bravery and prudence, to Denmark, to press forward the equipment of the
fleet, which, under the new luxurious king, proceeds but slowly. Horatio
has known the former king, having fought in his battles, having even
stood in favor with him,&mdash;a circumstance by which the first
ghost-scene will be nothing injured. The new sovereign gives Horatio
audience, and sends Laertes into Norway with intelligence that the fleet
will soon arrive; whilst Horatio is commissioned to accelerate the
preparation of it: and the Queen, on the other hand, will not consent
that Hamlet, as he wishes, should go to sea along with him."</p>

<p>"Heaven be praised!" cried Serlo: "we shall now get rid of Wittenberg
and the university, which was always a sorry piece of business. I think
your idea extremely good; for, except these two distant objects, Norway
and the fleet, the spectator will not be required to <i>fancy</i> any thing:
the rest he will <i>see</i>; the rest takes place before him; whereas, his
imagination, on the other plan, was hunted over all the world."</p>

<p>"You easily perceive," said Wilhelm, "how I shall contrive to keep the
other parts together. When Hamlet tells Horatio of his uncle's crime,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Horatio counsels him to go to Norway in his company, to secure the
affections of the army, and return in warlike force. Hamlet also is
becoming dangerous to the King and Queen; they find no readier method of
deliverance, than to send him in the fleet, with Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern to be spies upon him; and, as Laertes in the mean time
comes from France, they determine that this youth, exasperated even to
murder, shall go after him. Unfavorable winds detain the fleet: Hamlet
returns; for his wandering through the churchyard, perhaps some lucky
motive may be thought of; his meeting with Laertes in Ophelia's grave is
a grand moment, which we must not part with. After this, the King
resolves that it is better to get quit of Hamlet on the spot: the
festival of his departure, the pretended reconcilement with Laertes, are
now solemnized; on which occasion knightly sports are held, and Laertes
fights with Hamlet. Without the four corpses, I cannot end the play: no
one must survive. The right of popular election now again comes in
force; and Hamlet, while dying, gives his vote to Horatio."</p>

<p>"Quick! quick!" said Serlo, "sit down and work the play: your plan has
my entire approbation; only let not your zeal evaporate."</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>Wilhelm had already been for some time busied with translating "Hamlet;"
making use, as he labored, of Wieland's spirited performance, through
which he had first become acquainted with Shakspeare. What had been
omitted in Wieland's work he replaced, and had secured a complete
version, at the very time when Serlo and he were pretty well agreed
about the way of treating it. He now began, according to his plan, to
cut out and insert, to separate and unite, to alter, and often to
restore; for, satisfied as he was with his own conception, it still
appeared to him as if, in executing it, he were but spoiling the
original.</p>

<p>When all was finished, he read his work to Serlo and the rest. They
declared themselves exceedingly contented with it: Serlo, in particular,
made many flattering observations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have felt very justly," said he, among other things, "that some
external circumstances must accompany this play, but that they must be
simpler than those which the great poet has employed. What takes place
without the theatre, what the spectator does not see, but must imagine,
is like a background, in front of which the acting figures move. Your
large and simple prospect of the fleet and Norway will do much to
improve the play; if this were altogether taken from it, we should have
but a family scene remaining; and the great idea, that here a kingly
house, by internal crimes and incongruities, goes down to ruin, would
not be presented with its proper dignity. But if the former background
were left standing, so manifold, so fluctuating and confused, it would
hurt the impression of the figures."</p>

<p>Wilhelm again took Shakspeare's part; alleging that he wrote for
islanders, for Englishmen, who generally, in the distance, were
accustomed to see little else than ships and voyages, the coast of
France and privateers; and thus what perplexed and distracted others was
to them quite natural.</p>

<p>Serlo assented; and both were of opinion, that, as the play was now to
be produced upon the German stage, this more serious and simple
background was the best adapted for the German mind.</p>

<p>The parts had been distributed before: Serlo undertook Polonius;
Aurelia, Ophelia; Laertes was already designated by his name; a young,
thick-set, jolly new-comer was to be Horatio; the King and Ghost alone
occasioned some perplexity, for both of these no one but Old Boisterous
remaining. Serlo proposed to make the Pedant, King; but against this our
friend protested in the strongest terms. They could resolve on nothing.</p>

<p>Wilhelm had also allowed both Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to continue
in his play. "Why not compress them into one?" said Serlo. "This
abbreviation will not cost you much."</p>

<p>"Heaven keep me from all such curtailments!" answered Wilhelm: "they
destroy at once the sense and the effect. What these two persons are and
do it is impossible to represent by one. In such small matters we
discover Shakspeare's greatness. These soft approaches, this smirking
and bowing, this assenting, wheedling, flattering, this whisking
agility, this wagging of the tail, this allness and emptiness, this
legal knavery, this ineptitude and insipidity,&mdash;how can they be
expressed by a single man? There ought to be at least a dozen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
these people, if they could be had; for it is only in society that they
are any thing; they are society itself; and Shakspeare showed no little
wisdom and discernment in bringing in a pair of them. Besides, I need
them as a couple that may be contrasted with the single, noble,
excellent Horatio."</p>

<p>"I understand you," answered Serlo, "and we can arrange it. One of them
we shall hand over to Elmira, Old Boisterous's eldest daughter: it will
all be right, if they look well enough; and I will deck and trim the
puppets so that it shall be first-rate fun to behold them."</p>

<p>Philina was rejoicing not a little, that she had to act the Duchess in
the small subordinate play. "I will show it so natural," cried she, "how
you wed a second husband, without loss of time, when you have loved the
first immensely. I mean to win the loudest plaudits, and every man shall
wish to be the third."</p>

<p>Aurelia gave a frown: her spleen against Philina was increasing every
day.</p>

<p>"'Tis a pity, I declare," said Serlo, "that we have no ballet; else you
should dance me a <i>pas de deux</i> with your first, and then another with
your second husband,&mdash;and the first might dance himself to sleep by
the measure; and your bits of feet and ankles would look so pretty,
tripping to and fro upon the side stage."</p>

<p>"Of my ankles you do not know much," replied she pertly; "and as to my
bits of feet," cried she, hastily reaching below the table, pulling off
her slippers, and holding them together out to Serlo, "here are the
cases of them; and I challenge you to find me more dainty ones."</p>

<p>"I was in earnest," said he, looking at the elegant half-shoes. "In
truth, one does not often meet with any thing so dainty."</p>

<p>They were of Parisian workmanship: Philina had received them as a
present from the countess, a lady whose foot was celebrated for its
beauty.</p>

<p>"A charming thing!" cried Serlo: "my heart leaps at the sight of them."</p>

<p>"What gallant throbs!" replied Philina.</p>

<p>"There is nothing in the world beyond a pair of slippers," said he, "of
such pretty manufacture, in their proper time and place, when"&mdash;</p>

<p>Philina took her slippers from his hands, crying, "You have squeezed
them all! They are far too wide for me!" She played with them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
rubbed the soles of them together. "How hot it is!" cried she, clapping
the sole upon her cheek, then again rubbing, and holding it to Serlo. He
was innocent enough to stretch out his hand to feel the warmth. "Clip!
clap!" cried she, giving him a smart rap over the knuckles with the
heel; so that he screamed, and drew back his hand. "That's for indulging
in thoughts of your own at the sight of my slippers."</p>

<p>"And that's for using old folk like children," cried the other; then
sprang up, seized her, and plundered many a kiss, every one of which she
artfully contested with a show of serious reluctance. In this romping,
her long hair got loose, and floated round the group; the chair overset;
and Aurelia, inwardly indignant at such rioting, arose in great
vexation.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>Though in this remoulding of "Hamlet" many characters had been cut off,
a sufficient number of them still remained,&mdash;a number which the
company was scarcely adequate to meet.</p>

<p>"If this is the way of it," said Serlo, "our prompter himself must issue
from his den, and mount the stage, and become a personage like one of
us."</p>

<p>"In his own station," answered Wilhelm, "I have frequently admired him."</p>

<p>"I do not think," said Serlo, "that there is in the world a more perfect
artist of his kind. No spectator ever hears him: we upon the stage catch
every syllable. He has formed in himself, as it were, a peculiar set of
vocal organs for this purpose: he is like a Genius that whispers
intelligibly to us in the hour of need. He feels, as if by instinct,
what portion of his task an actor is completely master of, and
anticipates from afar where his memory will fail him. I have known cases
in which I myself had scarcely read my part: he said it over to me word
for word, and I played happily. Yet he has some peculiarities which
would make another in his place quite useless. For example, he takes
such an interest in the plays, that, in giving any moving passage, he
does not indeed declaim it, but he reads it with all pomp and pathos.
By this ill habit he has nonplussed me on more than one occasion."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"As with another of his singularities," observed Aurelia, "he once left
me sticking fast in a very dangerous passage."</p>

<p>"How could this happen, with the man's attentiveness?" said Wilhelm.</p>

<p>"He is so affected," said Aurelia, "by certain passages, that he weeps
warm tears, and for a few moments loses all reflection; and it is not
properly passages such as we should call affecting that produce this
impression on him; but, if I express myself clearly, the <i>beautiful</i>
passages, those out of which the pure spirit of the poet looks forth, as
it were, through open, sparkling eyes,&mdash;passages which others at
most rejoice over, and which many thousands altogether overlook."</p>

<p>"And with a soul so tender, why does he never venture on the stage?"</p>

<p>"A hoarse voice," said Serlo, "and a stiff carriage, exclude him from
it; as his melancholic temper excludes him from society. What trouble
have I taken, and in vain, to make him take to me! But he is a charming
reader; such another I have never heard; no one can observe like him the
narrow limit between declamation and graceful recital."</p>

<p>"The very man!" exclaimed our friend, "the very man! What a fortunate
discovery! We have now the proper hand for delivering the passage of
'The rugged Pyrrhus.'"</p>

<p>"One requires your eagerness," said Serlo, "before he can employ every
object in the use it was meant for."</p>

<p>"In truth," said Wilhelm, "I was very much afraid we should be obliged
to leave this passage out: the omission would have lamed the whole
play."</p>

<p>"Well! That is what I cannot understand," observed Aurelia.</p>

<p>"I hope you will erelong be of my opinion," answered Wilhelm.
"Shakspeare has introduced these travelling players with a double
purpose. The person who recites the death of Priam with such feeling, in
the <i>first</i> place, makes a deep impression on the prince himself; he
sharpens the conscience of the wavering youth: and, accordingly, this
scene becomes a prelude to that other, where, in the <i>second</i> place, the
little play produces such effect upon the King. Hamlet sees himself
reproved and put to shame by the player, who feels so deep a sympathy in
foreign and fictitious woes; and the thought of making an experiment
upon the conscience of his stepfather is in consequence suggested to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
him. What a royal monologue is that, which ends the second act! How
charming it will be to speak it!</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">"'Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!</span>
  <span class="i2">Is it not monstrous that this player here,</span>
  <span class="i2">But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,</span>
  <span class="i2">Could force his soul so to his own conceit,</span>
  <span class="i2">That, from her working, all his visage wann'd;</span>
  <span class="i2">Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,</span>
  <span class="i2">A broken voice, and his whole function suiting</span>
  <span class="i2">With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!</span>
  <span class="i2">For Hecuba!</span>
  <span class="i2">What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,</span>
  <span class="i2">That he should weep for her?'"</span>
 </div>
</div>

<p>"If we can but persuade our man to come upon the stage," observed
Aurelia.</p>

<p>"We must lead him to it by degrees," said Serlo. "At the rehearsal he
may read the passage: we shall tell him that an actor whom we are
expecting is to play it; and so, by and by, we shall lead him nearer to
the point."</p>

<p>Having agreed on this affair, the conversation next turned upon the
Ghost. Wilhelm could not bring himself to give the part of the living
King to the Pedant, that so Old Boisterous might play the Ghost: he was
of opinion that they ought to wait a while; because some other actors
had announced themselves, and among these it was probable they would
find a fitter man.</p>

<p>We can easily conceive, then, how astonished Wilhelm must have been
when, returning home that evening, he found a billet lying on his table,
sealed with singular figures, and containing what follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Strange youth! we know thou art in great perplexity. For thy Hamlet
thou canst hardly find men enough, not to speak of ghosts. Thy zeal
deserves a miracle: miracles we cannot work, but somewhat marvellous
shall happen. If thou have faith, the Ghost shall arise at the proper
hour! Be of courage and keep firm! This needs no answer: thy
determination will be known to us."</p>

<p>With this curious sheet he hastened back to Serlo, who read and re-read
it, and at last declared, with a thoughtful look, that it seemed a
matter of some moment; that they must consider well and seriously
whether they could risk it. They talked the subject over at some length;
Aurelia was silent, only smiling now and then; and a few days after,
when speaking of the incident again, she gave our friend, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
obscurely, to understand that she held it all a joke of Serlo's. She
desired him to cast away anxiety, and to expect the Ghost with patience.</p>

<p>Serlo, for most part, was in excellent humor: the actors that were going
to leave him took all possible pains to play well, that their absence
might be much regretted; and this, combined with the new-fangled zeal of
the others, gave promise of the best results.</p>

<p>His intercourse with Wilhelm had not failed to exert some influence on
him. He began to speak more about art: for, after all, he was a German;
and Germans like to give themselves account of what they do. Wilhelm
wrote down many of their conversations; which, as our narrative must not
be so often interrupted here, we shall communicate to such of our
readers as feel an interest in dramaturgic matters, by some other
opportunity.</p>

<p>In particular, one evening, the manager was very merry in speaking of
the part of Polonius, and how he meant to take it up. "I engage," said
he, "on this occasion, to present a very meritorious person in his best
aspect. The repose and security of this old gentleman, his emptiness and
his significance, his exterior gracefulness and interior meanness, his
frankness and sycophancy, his sincere roguery and deceitful truth, I
will introduce with all due elegance in their fit proportions. This
respectable, gray-haired, enduring, time-serving half-knave, I will
represent in the most courtly style: the occasional roughness and
coarseness of our author's strokes will further me here. I will speak
like a book when I am prepared beforehand, and like an ass when I utter
the overflowings of my heart. I will be insipid and absurd enough to
chime in with every one, and acute enough never to observe when people
make a mock of me. I have seldom taken up a part with so much zeal and
roguishness."</p>

<p>"Could I but hope as much from mine!" exclaimed Aurelia. "I have neither
youth nor softness enough to be at home in this character. One thing
alone I am too sure of,&mdash;the feeling that turns Ophelia's brain, I
shall not want."</p>

<p>"We must not take the matter up so strictly," said our friend. "For my
share, I am certain, that the wish to act the character of Hamlet has
led me exceedingly astray, throughout my study of the play. And now, the
more I look into the part, the more clearly do I see, that, in my whole
form and physiognomy, there is not one feature such as Shakspeare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
meant for Hamlet. When I consider with what nicety the various
circumstances are adapted to each other, I can scarcely hope to produce
even a tolerable effect."</p>

<p>"You are entering on your new career with becoming conscientiousness,"
said Serlo. "The actor fits himself to his part as he can, and the part
to him as it must. But how has Shakspeare drawn his Hamlet? Is he so
utterly unlike you?"</p>

<p>"In the first place," answered Wilhelm, "he is fair-haired."</p>

<p>"That I call far-fetched," observed Aurelia. "How do you infer that?"</p>

<p>"As a Dane, as a Northman, he is fair-haired and blue-eyed by descent."</p>

<p>"And you think Shakspeare had this in view?"</p>

<p>"I do not find it specially expressed; but, by comparison of passages, I
think it incontestable. The fencing tires him; the sweat is running from
his brow; and the Queen remarks, '<i>He's fat, and scant of breath</i>.' Can
you conceive him to be otherwise than plump and fair-haired?
Brown-complexioned people, in their youth, are seldom plump. And does
not his wavering melancholy, his soft lamenting, his irresolute
activity, accord with such a figure? From a dark-haired young man, you
would look for more decision and impetuosity."</p>

<p>"You are spoiling my imagination," cried Aurelia: "away with your fat
Hamlets! Do not set your well-fed prince before us! Give us rather any
<i>succedaneum</i> that will move us, will delight us. The intention of the
author is of less importance to us than our own enjoyment, and we need a
charm that is adapted for us."</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p>One evening a dispute arose among our friends about the novel and the
drama, and which of them deserved the preference. Serlo said it was a
fruitless and misunderstood debate: both might be superior in their
kinds, only each must keep within the limits proper to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"About their limits and their kinds," said Wilhelm, "I confess myself
not altogether clear."</p>

<p>"Who <i>is</i> so?" said the other; "and yet perhaps it were worth while to
come a little closer to the business."</p>

<p>They conversed together long upon the matter; and, in fine, the
following was nearly the result of their discussion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the novel as well as in the drama, it is human nature and human
action that we see. The difference between these sorts of fiction lies
not merely in their outward form,&mdash;not merely in the circumstance
that the personages of the one are made to speak, while those of the
other have commonly their history narrated. Unfortunately many dramas
are but novels, which proceed by dialogue; and it would not be
impossible to write a drama in the shape of letters.</p>

<p>"But, in the novel, it is chiefly <i>sentiments</i> and <i>events</i> that are
exhibited; in the drama, it is <i>characters</i> and <i>deeds</i>. The novel must
go slowly forward; and the sentiments of the hero, by some means or
another, must restrain the tendency of the whole to unfold itself and to
conclude. The drama, on the other hand, must hasten: and the character
of the hero must press forward to the end: it does not restrain, but is
restrained. The novel-hero must be suffering,&mdash;at least he must not
in a high degree be active: in the dramatic one, we look for activity
and deeds. Grandison, Clarissa, Pamela, the Vicar of Wakefield, Tom
Jones himself, are, if not suffering, at least retarding, personages;
and the incidents are all in some sort modelled by their sentiments. In
the drama the hero models nothing by himself; all things withstand him;
and he clears and casts away the hinderances from off his path, or else
sinks under them."</p>

<p>Our friends were also of opinion, that, in the novel, some degree of
scope may be allowed to Chance, but that it must always be led and
guided by the sentiments of the personages: on the other hand, that
Fate, which, by means of outward, unconnected circumstances, carries
forward men, without their own concurrence, to an unforeseen
catastrophe, can have place only in the drama; that Chance may produce
pathetic situations, but never tragic ones; Fate, on the other hand,
ought always to be terrible,&mdash;and is, in the highest sense, tragic,
when it brings into a ruinous concatenation the guilty man, and the
guiltless that was unconcerned with him.</p>

<p>These considerations led them back to the play of "Hamlet," and the
peculiarities of its composition. The hero in this case, it was
observed, is endowed more properly with sentiments than with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
character: it is events alone that push him on, and accordingly the play
has in some measure the expansion of a novel. But as it is Fate that
draws the plan, as the story issues from a deed of terror, and the hero
is continually driven forward to a deed of terror, the work is tragic in
the highest sense, and admits of no other than a tragic end.</p>

<p>The book-rehearsal was now to take place, to which Wilhelm had looked
forward as to a festival. Having previously collated all the parts, no
obstacle on this side could oppose him. The whole of the actors were
acquainted with the piece: he endeavored to impress their minds with the
importance of these book-rehearsals. "As you require," said he, "of
every musical performer, that he shall, in some degree, be able to play
from the book: so every actor, every educated man, should train himself
to recite from the book, to catch immediately the character of any
drama, any poem, any tale he may be reading, and exhibit it with grace
and readiness. No committing to memory will be of service, if the actor
have not, in the first place, penetrated into the sense and spirit of
his author: the mere letter will avail him nothing."</p>

<p>Serlo declared that he would overlook all subsequent
rehearsals,&mdash;the last rehearsal itself,&mdash;if justice were but
done to these rehearsals from the book. "For, commonly," said he, "there
is nothing more amusing than to hear an actor speak of study: it is as
if freemasons were to talk of building."</p>

<p>The rehearsal passed according to their wishes; and we may assert, that
the fame and favor which our company acquired afterwards had their
foundation in these few but well-spent hours.</p>

<p>"You did right, my friend," said Serlo, when they were alone, "in
speaking to our fellow-laborers so earnestly; and yet I am afraid they
will scarcely fulfil your wishes."</p>

<p>"How so?" asked Wilhelm.</p>

<p>"I have noticed," answered Serlo, "that, as easily as you may set in
motion the imaginations of men, gladly as they listen to your tales and
fictions, it is yet very seldom that you find among them any touch of an
imagination you can call productive. In actors this remark is strikingly
exemplified. Any one of them is well content to undertake a beautiful,
praiseworthy, brilliant part; and seldom will any one of them do more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
than self-complacently transport himself into his hero's place, without
in the smallest troubling his head whether other people view him so or
not. But to seize with vivacity what the author's feeling was in
writing; what portion of your individual qualities you must cast off, in
order to do justice to a part; how, by your own conviction that you are
become another man, you may carry with you the convictions of the
audience; how, by the inward truth of your conceptive power, you can
change these boards into a temple, this pasteboard into woods,&mdash;to
seize and execute all this, is given to very few. That internal strength
of soul, by which alone deception can be brought about; that lying
truth, without which nothing will affect us rightly,&mdash;have, by most
men, never even been imagined.</p>

<p>"Let us not, then, press too hard for spirit and feeling in our friends.
The surest way is first coolly to instruct them in the sense and letter
of the play,&mdash;if possible, to open their understandings. Whoever
has the talent will then, of his own accord, eagerly adopt the spirited
feeling and manner of expression; and those who have it not will at
least be prevented from acting or reciting altogether falsely. And among
actors, as indeed in all cases, there is no worse arrangement than for
any one to make pretensions to the spirit of a thing, while the sense
and letter of it are not ready and clear to him."</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p>Coming to the first stage-rehearsal very early, Wilhelm found himself
alone upon the boards. The appearance of the place surprised him, and
awoke the strangest recollections. A forest and village scene stood
exactly represented as he once had seen it in the theatre of his native
town. On that occasion also, a rehearsal was proceeding; and it was the
morning when Mariana first confessed her love to him, and promised him a
happy interview. The peasants' cottages resembled one another on the two
stages, as they did in nature: the true morning sun, beaming through a
half-closed window-shutter, fell upon a part of a bench ill joined to a
cottage door; but unhappily it did not now enlighten Mariana's waist and
bosom. He sat down, reflecting on this strange coincidence: he almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
thought that perhaps on this very spot he would soon see her again. And,
alas! the truth was nothing more, than that an afterpiece, to which this
scene belonged, was at that time very often played upon the German
stage.</p>

<p>Out of these meditations he was roused by the other actors, along with
whom two amateurs, frequenters of the wardrobe and the stage, came in,
and saluted Wilhelm with a show of great enthusiasm. One of these was in
some degree attached to Frau Melina, but the other was entirely a lover
of the art, and both were of the kind which a good company should always
wish to have about it. It was difficult to say whether their love for
the stage, or their knowledge of it, was the greater. They loved it too
much to know it perfectly: they knew it well enough to prize the good
and to discard the bad. But, their inclination being so powerful, they
could tolerate the mediocre; and the glorious joy which they experienced
from the foretaste and the aftertaste of excellence surpassed
expression. The mechanical department gave them pleasure, the
intellectual charmed them; and so strong was their susceptibility, that
even a discontinuous rehearsal afforded them a species of illusion.
Deficiencies appeared in their eyes to fade away in distance: the
successful touched them like an object near at hand. In a word, they
were judges such as every artist wishes in his own department. Their
favorite movement was from the side-scenes to the pit, and from the pit
to the side-scenes; their happiest place was in the wardrobe; their
busiest employment was in trying to improve the dress, position,
recitation, gesture, of the actor; their liveliest conversation was on
the effect produced by him; their most constant effort was to keep him
accurate, active, and attentive, to do him service or kindness, and,
without squandering, to procure for the company a series of enjoyments.
The two had obtained the exclusive privilege of being present on the
stage at rehearsals as well as exhibitions. In regard to "Hamlet," they
had not in all points agreed with Wilhelm: here and there he had
yielded; but, for most part, he had stood by his opinion: and, upon the
whole, these discussions had been very useful in the forming of his
taste. He showed both gentlemen how much he valued them; and they again
predicted nothing less, from these combined endeavors, than a new epoch
for the German theatre.</p>

<p>The presence of these persons was of great service during the
rehearsals. In particular they labored to convince our players, that,
throughout the whole of their preparations, the posture and action,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
as they were intended ultimately to appear, should always be combined
with the words, and thus the whole be mechanically united by habit. In
rehearsing a tragedy especially, they said, no common movement with the
hands should be allowed: a tragic actor that took snuff in the rehearsal
always frightened them; for, in all probability, on coming to the same
passage in the exhibition, he would miss his pinch. Nay, on the same
principles, they maintained that no one should rehearse in boots, if his
part were to be played in shoes. But nothing, they declared, afflicted
them so much as when the women, in rehearsing, stuck their hands into
the folds of their gowns.</p>

<p>By the persuasion of our friends, another very good effect was brought
about: the actors all began to learn the use of arms. Since military
parts occur so frequently, said they, can any thing look more absurd
than men, without the smallest particle of discipline, trolling about
the stage in captains' and majors' uniforms?</p>

<p>Wilhelm and Laertes were the first that took lessons of a subaltern:
they continued their practising of fence with the greatest zeal.</p>

<p>Such pains did these two men take for perfecting a company which had so
fortunately come together. They were thus providing for the future
satisfaction of the public, while the public was usually laughing at
their taste. People did not know what gratitude they owed our friends,
particularly for performing one service,&mdash;the service of frequently
impressing on the actor the fundamental point, that it was his duty to
speak so loud as to be heard. In this simple matter, they experienced
more opposition and repugnance than could have been expected. Most part
maintained that they were heard well enough already; some laid the blame
upon the building; others said, one could not yell and bellow, when one
had to speak naturally, secretly, or tenderly.</p>

<p>Our two friends, having an immeasurable stock of patience, tried every
means of undoing this delusion, of getting round this obstinate
self-will. They spared neither arguments nor flatteries; and at last
they reached their object, being aided not a little by the good example
of Wilhelm. By him they were requested to sit down in the remotest
corners of the house, and, every time they did not hear him perfectly,
to rap on the bench with a key. He articulated well, spoke out in a
measured manner, raised his tones gradually, and did not overcry
himself in the most vehement passages. The rapping of the key was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
heard less and less every new rehearsal: by and by the rest submitted to
the same operation, and at last it seemed rational to hope that the
piece would be heard by every one in all the nooks of the house.</p>

<p>From this example we may see how desirous people are to reach their
object in their own way; what need there often is of enforcing on them
truths which are self-evident; and how difficult it may be to reduce the
man who aims at effecting something to admit the primary conditions
under which alone his enterprise is possible.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p>The necessary preparations for scenery and dresses, and whatever else
was requisite, were now proceeding. In regard to certain scenes and
passages, our friend had whims of his own, which Serlo humored, partly
in consideration of their bargain, partly from conviction, and because
he hoped by these civilities to gain Wilhelm, and to lead him according
to his own purposes the more implicitly in time to come.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, the King and Queen were, at the first audience, to
appear sitting on the throne, with the courtiers at the sides, and
Hamlet standing undistinguished in the crowd. "Hamlet," said he, "must
keep himself quiet: his sable dress will sufficiently point him out. He
should rather shun remark than seek it. Not till the audience is ended,
and the King speaks with him as with a son, should he advance, and allow
the scene to take its course."</p>

<p>A formidable obstacle still remained, in regard to the two pictures
which Hamlet so passionately refers to in the scene with his mother. "We
ought," said Wilhelm, "to have both of them visible, at full length, in
the bottom of the chamber, near the main door; and the former king must
be clad in armor, like the Ghost, and hang at the side where it enters.
I could wish that the figure held its right hand in a commanding
attitude, were somewhat turned away, and, as it were, looked over its
shoulder, that so it might perfectly resemble the Ghost at the moment
when he issues from the door. It will produce a great effect, when at
this instant Hamlet looks upon the Ghost, and the Queen upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
picture. The stepfather may be painted in royal ornaments, but not so
striking."</p>

<p>There were several other points of this sort, about which we shall,
perhaps, elsewhere have opportunity to speak.</p>

<p>"Are you, then, inexorably bent on Hamlet's dying at the end?" inquired
Serlo.</p>

<p>"How can I keep him alive," said Wilhelm, "when the whole play is
pressing him to death? We have already talked at large on that matter."</p>

<p>"But the public wishes him to live."</p>

<p>"I will show the public any other complaisance; but, as to this, I
cannot. We often wish that some gallant, useful man, who is dying of a
chronical disease, might yet live longer. The family weep, and conjure
the physician; but he cannot stay him: and no more than this physician
can withstand the necessity of nature, can we give law to an
acknowledged necessity of art. It is a false compliance with the
multitude, to raise in them emotions which they <i>wish</i>, when these are
not emotions which they <i>ought</i>, to feel."</p>

<p>"Whoever pays the cash," said Serlo, "may require the ware according to
his liking."</p>

<p>"Doubtless, in some degree," replied our friend; "but a great public
should be reverenced, not used as children are, when pedlers wish to
hook the money from them. By presenting excellence to the people, you
should gradually excite in them a taste and feeling for the excellent;
and they will pay their money with double satisfaction when reason
itself has nothing to object against this outlay. The public you may
flatter, as you do a well-beloved child, to better, to enlighten, it;
not as you do a pampered child of quality, to perpetuate the error you
profit from."</p>

<p>In this manner various other topics were discussed relating to the
question, What might still be changed in the play, and what must of
necessity remain untouched? We shall not enter farther on those points
at present; but, perhaps, at some future time we may submit this altered
"Hamlet" itself to such of our readers as feel any interest in the
subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p>The main rehearsal was at length concluded: it had lasted very long.
Serlo and Wilhelm still found much to care for: notwithstanding all the
time which had already been consumed in preparation, some highly
necessary matters had been left to the very last moment.</p>

<p>Thus, the pictures of the kings, for instance, were not ready: and the
scene between Hamlet and his mother, from which so powerful an effect
was looked for, had a very helpless aspect, as the business stood; for
neither Ghost nor painted image of him was at present forthcoming. Serlo
made a jest of this perplexity: "We should be in a pretty scrape," said
he, "if the Ghost were to decline appearing, and the guard had nothing
to fight with but the air, and our prompter were obliged to speak the
spirit's part from the side-scenes."</p>

<p>"We will not scare away our strange friend by unbelief," said Wilhelm:
"doubtless at the proper season he will come, and astonish us as much as
the spectators."</p>

<p>"Well, certainly," said Serlo, "I shall be a happy man to-morrow night,
when once the play will have been acted. It costs us more arrangement
than I dreamed of."</p>

<p>"But none of you," exclaimed Philina, "will be happier than I, little as
my part disturbs me. Really, to hear a single subject talked of forever
and forever, when, after all, there is nothing to come of it beyond an
exhibition, which will be forgotten like so many hundred others, this is
what I have not patience for. In Heaven's name, not so many <i>pros</i> and
<i>cons</i>! The guests you entertain have always something to object against
the dinner; nay, if you could hear them talk of it at home, they cannot
understand how it was possible to undergo so sad a business."</p>

<p>"Let me turn your illustration, pretty one, to my own advantage,"
answered Wilhelm. "Consider how much must be done by art and nature, by
traffickers and tradesmen, before an entertainment can be given. How
many years the stag must wander in the forest, the fish in the river or
the sea, before they can deserve to grace our table! And what cares and
consultations with her cooks and servants has the lady of the house
submitted to! Observe with what indifference the people swallow the
production of the distant vintager, the seaman, and the vintner, as if
it were a thing of course. And ought these men to cease from laboring,
providing, and preparing; ought the master of the house to cease from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
purchasing and laying up the fruit of their exertions,&mdash;because at
last the enjoyment it affords is transitory? But no enjoyment can be
transitory; the impression which it leaves is permanent: and what is
done with diligence and effort communicates to the spectator a hidden
force, of which we cannot say how far its influence may reach."</p>

<p>"'Tis all one to me," replied Philina: "only here again I must observe,
that you men are constantly at variance with yourselves. With all this
conscientious horror at curtailing Shakspeare, you have missed the
finest thought there was in 'Hamlet'!"</p>

<p>"The finest?" cried our friend.</p>

<p>"Certainly the finest," said Philina: "the prince himself takes pleasure
in it."</p>

<p>"And it is?" inquired Serlo.</p>

<p>"If you wore a wig," replied Philina, "I would pluck it very coolly off
you; for I think you need to have your understanding opened."</p>

<p>The rest began to think what she could mean: the conversation paused.
The party arose; it was now grown late; they seemed about to separate.
While they were standing in this undetermined mood, Philina all at once
struck up a song, with a very graceful, pleasing tune:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">"Sing me not with such emotion,</span>
  <span class="i3">How the night so lonesome is:</span>
  <span class="i2">Pretty maids, I've got a notion</span>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">For as wife and man are plighted,</span>

 </div>
</div>

<p>She made a slight courtesy on concluding, and Serlo gave a loud "Bravo!"
She scuttled off, and left the room with a teehee of laughter. They
heard her singing and skipping as she went down-stairs.</p>

<p>Serlo passed into another room: Wilhelm bade Aurelia good-night; but she
continued looking at him for a few moments, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How I dislike that woman! Dislike her from my heart, and to her very
slightest qualities! Those brown eyelashes, with her fair hair, which
our brother thinks so charming, I cannot bear to look at; and that scar
upon her brow has something in it so repulsive, so low and base, that I
could recoil ten paces every time I meet her. She was lately telling as
a joke, that her father, when she was a child, threw a plate at her
head, of which this is the mark. It is well that she is marked in the
eyes and brow, that those about her may be on their guard."</p>

<p>Wilhelm made no answer; and Aurelia went on, apparently with greater
spleen,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is next to impossible for me to speak a kind, civil word to her, so
deeply do I hate her, with all her wheedling. Would that we were rid of
her! And you, too, my friend, have a certain complaisance for the
creature, a way of acting towards her, that grieves me to the
soul,&mdash;an attention which borders on respect; which, by Heaven! she
does not merit."</p>

<p>"Whatever she may be," replied our friend, "I owe her thanks. Her
upbringing is to blame: to her natural character I would do justice."</p>

<p>"Character!" exclaimed Aurelia; "and do you think such a creature has a
character? O you men! It is so like you! These are the women you
deserve!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>"My friend, can you suspect me?" answered Wilhelm. "I will give account
of every minute I have spent beside her."</p>

<p>"Come, come," replied Aurelia: "it is late, we will not quarrel. All
like each, and each like all! Good-night, my friend! Good-night, my
sparkling bird-of-paradise!"</p>

<p>Wilhelm asked how he had earned this title.</p>

<p>"Another time," cried she; "another time. They say it has no feet, but
hovers in the air, and lives on ether. That, however, is a story, a
poetic fiction. Good-night! Dream sweetly, if you are in luck!"</p>

<p>She proceeded to her room; and he, being left alone, made haste to his.</p>

<p>Half angrily he walked along his chamber to and fro. The jesting but
decided tone of Aurelia had hurt him: he felt deeply how unjust she was.
Could he treat Philina with unkindness or ill-nature? She had done no
evil to him; but, for any love to her, he could proudly and confidently
take his conscience to witness that it was not so.</p>

<p>On the point of beginning to undress, he was going forward to his bed to
draw aside the curtains, when, not without extreme astonishment, he saw
a pair of women's slippers lying on the floor before it. One of them was
resting on its sole, the other on its edge. They were Philina's
slippers: he recognized them but too well. He thought he noticed some
disorder in the curtains; nay, it seemed as if they moved. He stood, and
looked with unaverted eyes.</p>

<p>A new impulse, which he took for anger, cut his breath: after a short
pause, he recovered, and cried in a firm tone,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come out, Philina! What do you mean by this? Where is your sense, your
modesty? Are we to be the speech of the house to-morrow?"</p>

<p>Nothing stirred.</p>

<p>"I do not jest," continued he: "these pranks are little to my taste."</p>

<p>No sound! No motion!</p>

<p>Irritated and determined, he at last went forward to the bed, and tore
the curtains asunder. "Arise," said he, "if I am not to give you up my
room to-night."</p>

<p>With great surprise, he found his bed unoccupied; the sheets and pillows
in the sleekest rest. He looked around: he searched and searched, but
found no traces of the rouge. Behind the bed, the stove, the drawers,
there was nothing to be seen: he sought with great and greater
diligence; a spiteful looker-on might have believed that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
seeking in the hope of finding.</p>

<p>All thought of sleep was gone. He put the slippers on his table; went
past it, up and down; often paused before it; and a wicked sprite that
watched him has asserted that our friend employed himself for several
hours about these dainty little shoes; that he viewed them with a
certain interest; that he handled them and played with them; and it was
not till towards morning that he threw himself on the bed, without
undressing, where he fell asleep amidst a world of curious fantasies.</p>

<p>He was still slumbering, when Serlo entered hastily. "Where are you?"
cried he: "still in bed? Impossible! I want you in the theatre: we have
a thousand things to do."</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p>The forenoon and the afternoon fled rapidly away. The playhouse was
already full: our friend hastened to dress. It was not with the joy
which it had given him when he first essayed it, that he now put on the
garb of Hamlet: he only dressed that he might be in readiness. On his
joining the women in the stage-room, they unanimously cried that nothing
sat upon him right; the fine feather stood awry; the buckle of his belt
did not fit: they began to slit, to sew, and piece together. The music
started: Philina still objected somewhat to his ruff; Aurelia had much
to say against his mantle. "Leave me alone, good people," cried he:
"this negligence will make me liker Hamlet." The women would not let him
go, but continued trimming him. The music ceased: the acting was begun.
He looked at himself in the glass, pressed his hat closer down upon his
face, and retouched the painting of his cheeks.</p>

<p>At this instant somebody came rushing in, and cried, "The Ghost! the
Ghost!"</p>

<p>Wilhelm had not once had time all day to think of the Ghost, and whether
it would come or not. His anxiety on that head was at length removed,
and now some strange assistant was to be expected. The stage-manager
came in, inquiring after various matters: Wilhelm had not time to ask
about the Ghost; he hastened to present himself before the throne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
where King and Queen, surrounded with their court, were already glancing
in all the splendors of royalty, and waiting till the scene in front of
them should be concluded. He caught the last words of Horatio, who was
speaking of the Ghost, in extreme confusion, and seemed to have almost
forgotten his part.</p>

<p>The intermediate curtain went aloft, and Hamlet saw the crowded house
before him. Horatio, having spoken his address, and been dismissed by
the King, pressed through to Hamlet; and, as if presenting himself to
the Prince, he said, "The Devil is in harness: he has put us all in
fright."</p>

<p>In the mean while, two men of large stature, in white cloaks and
capouches, were observed standing in the side-scenes. Our friend, in the
distraction, embarrassment, and hurry of the moment, had failed in the
first soliloquy; at least, such was his own opinion, though loud
plaudits had attended his exit. Accordingly, he made his next entrance
in no pleasant mood, with the dreary wintry feeling of dramatic
condemnation. Yet he girded up his mind, and spoke that appropriate
passage on the "rouse and wassail," the "heavy-headed revel" of the
Danes, with suitable indifference; he had, like the audience, in
thinking of it, quite forgotten the Ghost; and he started, in real
terror, when Horatio cried out, "Look, my lord! it comes!" He whirled
violently round; and the tall, noble figure, the low, inaudible tread,
the light movement in the heavy-looking armor, made such an impression
on him, that he stood as if transformed to stone, and could utter only
in a half-voice his "Angels and ministers of grace defend us!" He glared
at the form, drew a deep breathing once or twice, and pronounced his
address to the Ghost in a manner so confused, so broken, so constrained,
that the highest art could not have hit the mark so well.</p>

<p>His translation of this passage now stood him in good stead. He had kept
very close to the original, in which the arrangement of the words
appeared to him expressive of a mind confounded, terrified, and seized
with horror:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">"'Be thou a spirit of health, or goblin damn'd,</span>
  <span class="i2">Bring with thee airs from heaven, or blasts from hell,</span>
  <span class="i2">Be thy intents wicked, or charitable,</span>
  <span class="i2">Thou com'st in such a questionable shape,</span>
  <span class="i2">That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,</span>
  <span class="i2">King, father, royal Dane: oh, answer me!'"</span>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>A deep effect was visible in the audience. The Ghost beckoned, the
Prince followed him amid the loudest plaudits.</p>

<p>The scene changed: and, when the two had re-appeared, the Ghost, on a
sudden, stopped, and turned round; by which means Hamlet came to be a
little too close upon it. With a longing curiosity, he looked in at the
lowered visor; but except two deep-lying eyes, and a well-formed nose,
he could discern nothing. Gazing timidly, he stood before the Ghost; but
when the first tones issued from the helmet, and a somewhat hoarse, yet
deep and penetrating, voice, pronounced the words, "I am thy father's
spirit," Wilhelm, shuddering, started back some paces; and the audience
shuddered with him. Each imagined that he knew the voice: Wilhelm
thought he noticed in it some resemblance to his father's. These strange
emotions and remembrances, the curiosity he felt about discovering his
secret friend, the anxiety about offending him, even the theatric
impropriety of coming too near him in the present situation, all this
affected Wilhelm with powerful and conflicting impulses. During the long
speech of the Ghost, he changed his place so frequently, he seemed so
unsettled and perplexed, so attentive and so absent-minded, that his
acting caused a universal admiration, as the Spirit caused a universal
horror. The latter spoke with a feeling of melancholy anger, rather than
of sorrow; but of an anger spiritual, slow, and inexhaustible. It was
the mistemper of a noble soul, that is severed from all earthly things,
and yet devoted to unbounded woe. At last he vanished, but in a curious
manner; for a thin, gray, transparent gauze arose from the place of
descent, like a vapor, spread itself over him, and sank along with him.</p>

<p>Hamlet's friends now entered, and swore upon the sword. Old Truepenny,
in the mean time, was so busy under ground, that, wherever they might
take their station, he was sure to call out right beneath them, "Swear!"
and they started, as if the soil had taken fire below them, and hastened
to another spot. On each of these occasions, too, a little flame pierced
through at the place where they were standing. The whole produced on the
spectators a profound impression.</p>

<p>After this, the play proceeded calmly on its course: nothing failed; all
prospered; the audience manifested their contentment, and the actors
seemed to rise in heart and spirits every scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p>The curtain fell, and rapturous applauses sounded out of every corner of
the house. The four princely corpses sprang aloft, and embraced each
other. Polonius and Ophelia likewise issued from their graves, and
listened with extreme satisfaction, as Horatio, who had stepped before
the curtain to announce the following play, was welcomed with the most
thundering plaudits. The people would not hear of any other play, but
violently required the repetition of the present.</p>

<p>"We have won," cried Serlo, "and so not another reasonable word this
night! Every thing depends on the first impression: we should never take
it ill of any actor, that, on occasion of his first appearance, he is
provident, and even self-willed."</p>

<p>The box-keeper came, and delivered him a heavy sum. "We have made a good
beginning," cried the manager, "and prejudice itself will now be on our
side. But where is the supper you promised us? To-night we may be
allowed to relish it a little."</p>

<p>It had been agreed that all the party were to stay together in their
stage-dresses, and enjoy a little feast among themselves. Wilhelm had
engaged to have the place in readiness, and Frau Melina to provide the
victuals.</p>

<p>A room, which commonly was occupied by scene-painters, had accordingly
been polished up as well as possible: our friends had hung it round with
little decorations, and so decked and trimmed it, that it looked half
like a garden, half like a colonnade. On entering it, the company were
dazzled with the glitter of a multitude of lights, which, across the
vapors of the sweetest and most copious perfumes, spread a stately
splendor over a well-decorated and well-furnished table. These
preparations were hailed with joyful interjections by the party; all
took their places with a certain genuine dignity; it seemed as if some
royal family had met together in the Kingdom of the Shades. Wilhelm sat
between Aurelia and the Frau Melina; Serlo between Philina and Elmira;
nobody was discontented with himself or with his place.</p>

<p>Our two theatric amateurs, who had from the first been present, now
increased the pleasure of the meeting. While the exhibition was
proceeding, they had several times stepped round, and come upon the
stage, expressing, in the warmest terms, the delight which they and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the audience felt. They now descended to particulars, and each was
richly rewarded for his efforts.</p>

<p>With boundless animation, the company extolled man after man, and
passage after passage. To the prompter, who had modestly sat down at the
bottom of the table, they gave a liberal commendation for his "rugged
Pyrrhus;" the fencing of Hamlet and Laertes was beyond all praise;
Ophelia's mourning had been inexpressibly exalted and affecting; of
Polonius they would not trust themselves to speak.</p>

<p>Every individual present heard himself commended through the rest and by
them, nor was the absent Ghost defrauded of his share of praise and
admiration. He had played the part, it was asserted, with a very happy
voice, and in a lofty style; but what surprised them most, was the
information which he seemed to have about their own affairs. He entirely
resembled the painted figure, as if he had sat to the painter of it; and
the two amateurs described, in glowing language, how awful it had looked
when the spirit entered near the picture, and stepped across before his
own image. Truth and error, they declared, had been commingled in the
strangest manner: they had felt as if the Queen really did not see the
Ghost. And Frau Melina was especially commended, because on this
occasion she had gazed upwards at the picture, while Hamlet was pointing
downwards at the Spectre.</p>

<p>Inquiry was now made how the apparition could have entered. The
stage-manager reported that a back-door, usually blocked up by
decorations, had that evening, as the Gothic hall was occupied, been
opened; that two large figures in white cloaks and hoods, one of whom
was not to be distinguished from the other, had entered by this passage;
and by the same, it was likely, they had issued when the third act was
over.</p>

<p>Serlo praised the Ghost for one merit,&mdash;that he had not whined and
lamented like a tailor; nay, to animate his son, had even introduced a
passage at the end, which more beseemed such a hero. Wilhelm had kept it
in memory: he promised to insert it in his manuscript.</p>

<p>Amid the pleasures of the entertainment, it had not been noticed that
the children and the harper were absent. Erelong they made their
entrance, and were blithely welcomed by the company. They came in
together, very strangely decked: Felix was beating a triangle, Mignon a
tambourine; the old man had his large harp hung round his neck, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
was playing on it whilst he carried it before him. They marched round
and round the table, and sang a multitude of songs. Eatables were handed
them; and the guests seemed to think they could not do a greater
kindness to the children, than by giving them as much sweet wine as they
chose to have. For the company themselves had not by any means neglected
a stock of savory flasks, presented by the two amateurs, which had
arrived that evening in baskets. The children tripped about, and sang:
Mignon, in particular, was frolicsome beyond all wont. She beat the
tambourine with the greatest liveliness and grace: now, with her finger
pressed against the parchment, she hummed across it swiftly to and fro;
now rattled on it with her knuckles, now with the back of her hand; nay,
sometimes, with alternating rhythm, she struck it first against her knee
and then against her head; and anon twirling it in her hand, she made
the shells jingle by themselves; and thus, from the simplest instrument,
elicited a great variety of tones. After she and Felix had long rioted
about, they sat down upon an elbow-chair which was standing empty at the
table, exactly opposite to Wilhelm.</p>

<p>"Keep out of the chair!" cried Serlo: "it is waiting for the Ghost, I
think; and, when he comes, it will be worse for you."</p>

<p>"I do not fear him," answered Mignon: "if he come, we can rise. He is my
uncle, and will not harm me." To those who did not know that her reputed
father had been named the Great Devil, this speech was unintelligible.</p>

<p>The party looked at one another: they were more and more confirmed in
their suspicion that the manager was in the secret of the Ghost. They
talked and tippled, and the girls from time to time cast timid glances
towards the door.</p>

<p>The children, who, sitting in the big chair, looked from over the table
but like puppets in their box, did actually at length start a little
drama in the style of Punch. The screeching tone of these people Mignon
imitated very well; and Felix and she began to knock their heads
together, and against the edges of the table, in such a way as only
wooden puppets could endure. Mignon, in particular, grew frantic with
gayety: the company, much as they had laughed at her at first, were in
fine obliged to curb her. But persuasion was of small avail; for she now
sprang up, and raved, and shook her tambourine, and capered round the
table. With her hair flying out behind her, with her head thrown back,
and her limbs, as it were, cast into the air, she seemed like one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
those antique Mænads, whose wild and all but impossible positions still,
on classic monuments, often strike us with amazement.</p>

<p>Incited by the talents and the uproar of the children, each endeavored
to contribute something to the entertainment of the night. The girls
sung several canons; Laertes whistled in the manner of a nightingale;
and the Pedant gave a symphony <i>pianissimo</i> upon the Jew's-harp.
Meanwhile the youths and damsels, who sat near each other, had begun a
great variety of games; in which, as the hands often crossed and met,
some pairs were favored with a transient squeeze, the emblem of a
hopeful kindness. Madam Melina in particular seemed scarcely to conceal
a decided tenderness for Wilhelm. It was late; and Aurelia, perhaps the
only one retaining self-possession in the party, now stood up, and
signified that it was time to go.</p>

<p>By way of termination, Serlo gave a firework, or what resembled one; for
he could imitate the sound of crackers, rockets, and fire wheels, with
his mouth, in a style of nearly inconceivable correctness. You had only
to shut your eyes, and the deception was complete. In the mean time,
they had all risen: the men gave their arms to the women to escort them
home. Wilhelm was walking last with Aurelia. The stage-manager met him
on the stairs, and said to him, "Here is the veil our Ghost vanished in;
it was hanging fixed to the place where he sank; we found it this
moment."&mdash;"A curious relic!" said our friend, and took it with him.</p>

<p>At this instant his left arm was laid hold of, and he felt a smart
twinge of pain in it. Mignon had hid herself in the place: she had
seized him, and bit his arm. She rushed past him, down stairs, and
disappeared.</p>

<p>On reaching the open air, almost all of them discovered that they had
drunk too liberally. They glided asunder without taking leave.</p>

<p>The instant Wilhelm gained his room, he stripped, and, extinguishing his
candle, hastened into bed. Sleep was overpowering him without delay,
when a noise, that seemed to issue from behind the stove, aroused him.
In the eye of his heated fancy, the image of the harnessed King was
hovering there: he sat up that he might address the Spectre; but he felt
himself encircled with soft arms, and his mouth was shut with kisses,
which he had not force to push away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p>Next morning Wilhelm started up with an unpleasant feeling, and found
himself alone. His head was still dim with the tumult, which he had not
yet entirely slept off; and the recollection of his nightly visitant
disquieted his mind. His first suspicion lighted on Philina; but, on
second thoughts, he conceived that it could not have been she. He sprang
out of bed: and, while putting on his clothes, he noticed that the door,
which commonly he used to bolt, was now ajar; though whether he had shut
it on the previous night, or not, he could not recollect.</p>

<p>But what surprised him most was the Spirit's veil, which he found lying
on his bed. Having brought it up with him, he had most probably thrown
it there himself. It was a gray gauze: on the hem of it he noticed an
inscription broidered in dark letters. He unfolded it, and read the
words, "<span class="smcap">For the first and the last time! Flee, Youth! Flee!</span>" He was
struck with it, and knew not what to think or say.</p>

<p>At this moment Mignon entered with his breakfast. The aspect of the
child astonished Wilhelm, we may almost say frightened him. She appeared
to have grown taller over night: she entered with a stately, noble air,
and looked him in the face so earnestly, that he could not endure her
glances. She did not touch him, as at other times, when, for morning
salutation, she would press his hand, or kiss his cheek, his lips, his
arm, or shoulder; but, having put his things in order, she retired in
silence.</p>

<p>The appointed time of a first rehearsal now arrived: our friends
assembled, all of them entirely out of tune from yesternight's debauch.
Wilhelm roused himself as much as possible, that he might not at the
very outset violate the principles he had preached so lately with such
emphasis. His practice in the matter helped him through; for practice
and habit must, in every art, fill up the voids which genius and temper
in their fluctuations will so often leave.</p>

<p>But, in the present case, our friends had especial reason to admit the
truth of the remark, that no one should begin with a festivity any
situation that is meant to last, particularly that is meant to be a
trade, a mode of living. Festivities are fit for what is happily
concluded: at the commencement, they but waste the force and zeal which
should inspire us in the struggle, and support us through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
long-continued labor. Of all festivities, the marriage festival appears
the most unsuitable: calmness, humility, and silent hope befit no
ceremony more than this.</p>

<p>So passed the day, which to Wilhelm seemed the most insipid he had ever
spent. Instead of their accustomed conversation in the evening, the
company began to yawn: the interest of Hamlet was exhausted; they rather
felt it disagreeable than otherwise that the play was to be repeated
next night. Wilhelm showed the veil which the royal Dane had left: it
was to be inferred from this, that he would not come again. Serlo was
of that opinion; he appeared to be deep in the secrets of the Ghost:
but, on the other hand, the inscription, "Flee, youth! Flee!" seemed
inconsistent with the rest. How could Serlo be in league with any one
whose aim it was to take away the finest actor of his troop?</p>

<p>It had now become a matter of necessity to confer on Boisterous the
Ghost's part, and on the Pedant that of the King. Both declared that
they had studied these sufficiently: nor was it wonderful; for in such a
number of rehearsals, and so copious a treatment of the subject, all of
them had grown familiar with it: each could have exchanged his part with
any other. Yet they rehearsed a little here and there, and prepared the
new adventurers, as fully as the hurry would admit. When the company was
breaking up at a pretty late hour, Philina softly whispered Wilhelm as
she passed, "I must have my slippers back: thou wilt not bolt the door?"
These words excited some perplexity in Wilhelm, when he reached his
chamber; they strengthened the suspicion that Philina was the secret
visitant: and we ourselves are forced to coincide with this idea;
particularly as the causes, which awakened in our friend another and a
stranger supposition, cannot be disclosed. He kept walking up and down
his chamber in no quiet frame: his door was actually not yet bolted.</p>

<p>On a sudden Mignon rushed into the room, laid hold of him, and cried,
"Master! save the house! It is on fire!" Wilhelm sprang through the
door, and a strong smoke came rushing down upon him from the upper
story. On the street he heard the cry of fire; and the harper, with his
instrument in his hand, came down-stairs breathless through the smoke.
Aurelia hurried out of her chamber, and threw little Felix into
Wilhelm's arms.</p>

<p>"Save the child!" cried she, "and we will mind the rest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>Wilhelm did not look upon the danger as so great: his first thought was,
to penetrate to the source of the fire, and try to stifle it before it
reached a head. He gave Felix to the harper; commanding him to hasten
down the stone stairs, which led across a little garden-vault out into
the garden, and to wait with the children in the open air. Mignon took a
light to show the way. He begged Aurelia to secure her things there
also. He himself pierced upwards through the smoke, but it was in vain
that he exposed himself to such danger. The flame appeared to issue from
a neighboring house; it had already caught the wooden floor and
staircase: some others, who had hastened to his help, were suffering
like himself from fire and vapor. Yet he kept inciting them; he called
for water; he conjured them to dispute every inch with the flame, and
promised to abide by them to the last. At this instant, Mignon came
springing up, and cried. "Master! save thy Felix! The old man is mad! He
is killing him." Scarcely knowing what he did, Wilhelm darted down
stairs; and Mignon followed close behind him.</p>

<p>On the last steps, which led into the garden-vault, he paused with
horror. Some heaps of fire-wood branches, and large masses of straw,
which had been stowed in the place, were burning with a clear flame;
Felix was lying on the ground, and screaming; the harper stood aside,
holding down his head, and leaned against the wall. "Unhappy creature!
what is this?" said Wilhelm. The old man spoke not; Mignon lifted Felix,
and carried him with difficulty to the garden; while Wilhelm strove to
pull the fire asunder and extinguish it, but only by his efforts made
the flame more violent. At last he, too, was forced to flee into the
garden, with his hair and his eyelashes burned; tearing the harper with
him through the conflagration, who, with singed beard, unwillingly
accompanied him.</p>

<p>Wilhelm hastened instantly to seek the children. He found them on the
threshold of a summer-house at some distance: Mignon was trying every
effort to pacify her comrade. Wilhelm took him on his knee: he
questioned him, felt him, but could obtain no satisfactory account from
either him or Mignon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the fire had fiercely seized on several houses: it was now
enlightening all the neighborhood. Wilhelm looked at the child in the
red glare of the flames: he could find no wound, no blood, no hurt of
any kind. He groped over all the little creature's body, but the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
gave no sign of pain: on the contrary, he by degrees grew calm, and
began to wonder at the blazing houses, and express his pleasure at the
spectacle of beams and rafters burning all in order, like a grand
illumination, so beautifully there.</p>

<p>Wilhelm thought not of the clothes or goods he might have lost: he felt
deeply how inestimable to him was this pair of human beings, who had
just escaped so great a danger. He pressed little Felix to his heart
with a new emotion: Mignon, too, he was about to clasp with joyful
tenderness; but she softly avoided this: she took him by the hand, and
held it fast.</p>

<p>"Master," said she (till the present evening she had hardly ever named
him master; at first she used to name him sir, and afterwards to call
him father),&mdash;"Master! we have escaped an awful danger: thy Felix
was on the point of death."</p>

<p>By many inquiries, Wilhelm learned from her at last, that, when they
came into the vault, the harper tore the light from her hand, and set on
fire the straw. That he then put Felix down, laid his hands with strange
gestures on the head of the child, and drew a knife as if he meant to
sacrifice him. That she sprang forward, and snatched it from him; that
she screamed; and some one from the house, who was carrying something
down into the garden, came to her help, but must have gone away again in
the confusion, and left the old man and the child alone.</p>

<p>Two or even three houses were now flaming in a general blaze. Owing to
the conflagration in the vault, no person had been able to take shelter
in the garden. Wilhelm was distressed about his friends, and in a less
degree about his property. Not venturing to quit the children, he was
forced to sit, and see the mischief spreading more and more.</p>

<p>In this anxious state he passed some hours. Felix had fallen asleep on
his bosom: Mignon was lying at his side, and holding fast his hand. The
efforts of the people finally subdued the fire. The burned houses sank,
with successive crashes, into heaps; the morning was advancing; the
children awoke, and complained of bitter cold; even Wilhelm, in his
light dress, could scarcely brook the chillness of the falling dew. He
took the young ones to the rubbish of the prostrate building, where,
among the ashes and the embers, they found a very grateful warmth.</p>

<p>The opening day collected, by degrees, the various individuals of the
party. All of them had got away unhurt: no one had lost much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Wilhelm's trunk was saved among the rest.</p>

<p>Towards ten o'clock Serlo called them to rehearse their "Hamlet," at
least some scenes, in which fresh players were to act. He had some
debates to manage, on this point, with the municipal authorities. The
clergy required, that, after such a visitation of Providence, the
playhouse should be shut for some time; and Serlo, on the other hand,
maintained, that both for the purpose of repairing the damage he had
suffered, and of exhilarating the depressed and terrified spirits of the
people, nothing could be more in place than the exhibition of some
interesting play. His opinion in the end prevailed, and the house was
full. The actors played with singular fire, with more of a passionate
freedom than at first. The feelings of the audience had been heightened
by the horrors of the previous night, and their appetite for
entertainment had been sharpened by the tedium of a wasted and
dissipated day: every one had more than usual susceptibility for what
was strange and moving. Most of them were new spectators, invited by the
fame of the play: they could not compare the present with the preceding
evening. Boisterous played altogether in the style of the unknown Ghost:
the Pedant, too, had accurately seized the manner of his predecessor;
nor was his own woful aspect without its use to him; for it seemed as
if, in spite of his purple cloak and his ermine collar, Hamlet were
fully justified in calling him a "king of shreds and patches."</p>

<p>Few have ever reached the throne by a path more singular than his had
been. But although the rest, and especially Philina, made sport of his
preferment, he himself signified that the count, a consummate judge, had
at the first glance predicted this and much more of him. Philina, on the
other hand, recommended lowliness of mind to him; saying, she would now
and then powder the sleeves of his coat, that he might remember that
unhappy night in the castle, and wear his crown with meekness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p>Our friends had sought out other lodgings, on the spur of the moment,
and were by this means much dispersed. Wilhelm had conceived a liking
for the garden-house, where he had spent the night of the conflagration:
he easily obtained the key, and settled himself there. But Aurelia being
greatly hampered in her new abode, he was obliged to retain little Felix
with him. Mignon, indeed, would not part with the boy.</p>

<p>He had placed the children in a neat chamber on the upper floor: he
himself was in the lower parlor. The young ones were asleep at this
time: Wilhelm could not sleep.</p>

<p>Adjoining the lovely garden, which the full moon had just risen to
illuminate, the black ruins of the fire were visible; and here and there
a streak of vapor was still mounting from them. The air was soft, the
night extremely beautiful. Philina, in issuing from the theatre, had
jogged him with her elbow, and whispered something to him, which he did
not understand. He felt perplexed and out of humor: he knew not what he
should expect or do. For a day or two Philina had avoided him: it was
not till to-night that she had given him any second signal. Unhappily
the doors, that he was not to bolt, were now consumed: the slippers had
evaporated into smoke. How the girl would gain admission to the garden,
if her aim was such, he knew not. He wished she might not come, and yet
he longed to have some explanation with her.</p>

<p>But what lay heavier at his heart than this, was the fate of the harper,
whom, since the fire, no one had seen. Wilhelm was afraid, that, in
clearing off the rubbish, they would find him buried under it. Our
friend had carefully concealed the suspicion which he entertained, that
it was the harper who had fired the house. The old man had been first
seen, as he rushed from the burning and smoking floor, and his
desperation in the vault appeared a natural consequence of such a deed.
Yet, from the inquiry which the magistrates had instituted touching the
affair, it seemed likely that the fire had not originated in the house
where Wilhelm lived, but had accidentally been kindled in the third from
that, and had crept along beneath the roofs before it burst into
activity.</p>

<p>Seated in a grove, our friend was meditating all these things, when he
heard a low footfall in a neighboring walk. By the melancholy song<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
which arose along with it, he recognized the harper. He caught the words
of the song without difficulty: it turned on the consolations of a
miserable man, conscious of being on the borders of insanity. Unhappily
our friend forgot the whole of it except the last verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">"Wheresoe'er my steps may lead me,</span><br />
  <span class="i2">Meekly at the door I'll stay:</span><br />
  <span class="i2">Pious hands will come to feed me,</span><br />
  <span class="i2">And I'll wander on my way.</span><br />
  <span class="i2">Each will feel a touch of gladness</span><br />
  <span class="i2">When my aged form appears:</span><br />
  <span class="i2">Each will shed a tear of sadness,</span><br />
  <span class="i2">Though I reck not of his tears."</span><br />
 </div>
</div>

<p>So singing, he had reached the garden-door, which led into an
unfrequented street. Finding it bolted, he was making an attempt to
climb the railing, when Wilhelm held him back, and addressed some kindly
words to him. The old man begged to have the door unlocked, declaring
that he would and must escape. Wilhelm represented to him that he might
indeed escape from the garden, but could not from the town; showing, at
the same time, what suspicions he must needs incur by such a step. But
it was in vain: the old man held by his opinion. Our friend, however,
would not yield; and at last he brought him, half by force, into the
garden-house, in which he locked himself along with him. The two carried
on a strange conversation; which, however, not to afflict our readers
with repeating unconnected thoughts and dolorous emotions, we had rather
pass in silence than detail at large.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p>Undetermined what to do with this unhappy man, who displayed such
indubitable symptoms of madness, Wilhelm would have been in great
perplexity, had not Laertes come that very morning, and delivered him
from his uncertainty. Laertes, as usual, rambling everywhere about the
town, had happened, in some coffee-house, to meet with a man, who, a
short time ago, had suffered under violent attacks of melancholy. This
person, it appeared, had been intrusted to the care of some country
clergyman, who made it his peculiar business to attend to people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
in such situations. In the present instance, as in many others, his
treatment had succeeded: he was still in town, and the friends of the
patient were showing him the greatest honor.</p>

<p>Wilhelm hastened to find out this person: he disclosed the case to him,
and agreed with him about the terms. The harper was to be brought over
to him, under certain pretexts. The separation deeply pained our friend;
so used was he to see the man beside him, and to hear his spirited and
touching strains. The hope of soon beholding him recovered, served, in
some degree, to moderate this feeling. The old man's harp had been
destroyed in the burning of the house: they purchased him another, and
gave it him when he departed.</p>

<p>Mignon's little wardrobe had in like manner been consumed. As Wilhelm
was about providing her with new apparel, Aurelia proposed that now at
last they should dress her as a girl.</p>

<p>"No! no! not at all!" cried Mignon, and insisted on it with such
earnestness, that they let her have her way.</p>

<p>The company had not much leisure for reflection: the exhibitions
followed close on one another.</p>

<p>Wilhelm often mingled with the audience, to ascertain their feelings;
but he seldom heard a criticism of the kind he wished: more frequently
the observations he listened to distressed or angered him. Thus, for
instance, shortly after "Hamlet" had been acted for the first time, a
youth was telling, with considerable animation, how happy he had been
that evening in the playhouse. Wilhelm hearkened, and was scandalized to
learn that his neighbor had, on that occasion, in contempt of those
behind him, kept his hat on, stubbornly refusing to remove it till the
play was done; to which heroical transaction he still looked back with
great contentment.</p>

<p>Another gentleman declared that Wilhelm played Laertes very well, but
that the actor who had undertaken Hamlet did not seem too happy in <i>his</i>
part. This permutation was not quite unnatural; for Wilhelm and Laertes
did resemble one another, though in a very distant manner.</p>

<p>A third critic warmly praised his acting, particularly in the scene with
his mother; only he regretted much, that, in this fiery moment, a white
strap had peered out from below the Prince's waistcoat, whereby the
illusion had been greatly marred.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the interior of the company, a multitude of alterations
were occurring. Philina, since the evening subsequent to that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
fire, had never given our friend the smallest sign of closer intimacy.
She had, as it seemed on purpose, hired a remote lodging: she associated
with Elmira, and came seldomer to Serlo,&mdash;an arrangement very
gratifying to Aurelia. Serlo continued still to like her, and often
visited her quarters, particularly when he hoped to find Elmira there.
One evening he took Wilhelm with him. At their entrance, both of them
were much surprised to see Philina, in the inner room, sitting in close
contact with a young officer. He wore a red uniform with white
pantaloons; but, his face being turned away, they could not see it.
Philina came into the outer room to meet her visitors, and shut the door
behind her. "You surprise me in the middle of a very strange adventure,"
cried she.</p>

<p>"It does not appear so strange," said Serlo; "but let us see this
handsome, young, enviable gallant. You have us in such training, that we
dare not show any jealousy, however it may be."</p>

<p>"I must leave you to suspicion for a time," replied Philina in a jesting
tone; "yet I can assure you, the gallant is a lady of my friends, who
wishes to remain a few days undiscovered. You shall know her history in
due season; nay, perhaps you shall even behold the beautiful spinster in
person; and then most probably I shall have need of all my prudence and
discretion, for it seems too likely that your new acquaintance will
drive your old friend out of favor."</p>

<p>Wilhelm stood as if transformed to stone. At the first glance, the red
uniform had reminded him of Mariana: the figure, too, was hers; the fair
hair was hers; only the present individual seemed to be a little taller.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake," cried he, "let us know something more about your
friend! let us see this lady in disguise! We are now partakers of your
secret: we will promise, we will swear; only let us see the lady!"</p>

<p>"What a fire he is in!" cried Philina: "but be cool, be calm; for to-day
there will nothing come of it."</p>

<p>"Let us only know her name!" cried Wilhelm.</p>

<p>"It were a fine secret, then," replied Philina.</p>

<p>"At least her first name!"</p>

<p>"If you can guess it, be it so. Three guesses I will give you,&mdash;not
a fourth. You might lead me through the whole calendar."</p>

<p>"Well!" said Wilhelm: "Cecilia, then?"</p>

<p>"None of your Cecilias!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>"Henrietta?"</p>

<p>"Not at all! Have a care, I pray you: guess better, or your curiosity
will have to sleep unsatisfied."</p>

<p>Wilhelm paused and shivered: he tried to speak, but the sound died away
within him. "Mariana?" stammered he at last, "Mariana?"</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried Philina. "Hit to a hair's-breadth!" said she, whirling
round upon her heel, as she was wont on such occasions.</p>

<p>Wilhelm could not utter a word; and Serlo, not observing his emotion,
urged Philina more and more to let them in.</p>

<p>Conceive the astonishment of both, when Wilhelm, suddenly and vehemently
interrupting their raillery, threw himself at Philina's feet, and, with
an air and tone of the deepest passion, begged and conjured her, "Let me
see the stranger," cried he: "she is mine; she is my Mariana! She for
whom I have longed all the days of my life, she who is still more to me
than all the women in this world! Go in to her at least, and tell her
that I am here,&mdash;that the man is here who linked to her his
earliest love, and all the happiness of his youth. Say that he will
justify himself, though he left her so unkindly; he will pray for pardon
of her; and will grant her pardon, whatsoever she may have done to him;
he will even make no pretensions further, if he may but see her, if he
may but see that she is living and in happiness."</p>

<p>Philina shook her head, and said, "Speak low! Do not betray us! If the
lady is indeed your friend, her feelings must be spared; for she does
not in the least suspect that you are here. Quite a different sort of
business brings her hither; and you know well enough, one had rather see
a spectre than a former lover at an inconvenient time. I will ask her,
and prepare her: we will then consider what is further to be done.
To-morrow I shall write you a note, saying when you are to come, or
whether you may come at all. Obey me punctually; for I protest, that,
without her own and my consent, no eye shall see this lovely creature. I
shall keep my doors better bolted; and, with axe and crow, you surely
will not visit me."</p>

<p>Our friend conjured her, Serlo begged of her; but all in vain: they were
obliged to yield, and leave the chamber and the house.</p>

<p>With what feelings Wilhelm passed the night is easy to conceive. How
slowly the hours of the day flowed on, while he sat expecting a message
from Philina, may also be imagined. Unhappily he had to play that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
evening: such mental pain he had never endured. The moment his part was
done, he hastened to Philina's house, without inquiring whether he had
got her leave or not. He found her doors bolted: and the people of the
house informed him that mademoiselle had set out early in the morning,
in company with a young officer; that she had talked about returning
shortly; but they had not believed her, she having paid her debts, and
taken every thing along with her.</p>

<p>This intelligence drove Wilhelm almost frantic. He hastened to Laertes,
that he might take measures for pursuing her, and, cost what it would,
for attaining certainty regarding her attendant. Laertes, however,
represented to him the imprudence of such passion and credulity. "I dare
wager, after all," said he, "that it is no one else but Friedrich. The
boy is of a high family, I know; he is madly in love with Philina; it is
likely he has cozened from his friends a fresh supply of money, so that
he can once more live with her in peace for a while."</p>

<p>These considerations, though they did not quite convince our friend,
sufficed to make him waver. Laertes showed him how improbable the story
was with which Philina had amused them; reminded him how well the
stranger's hair and figure answered Friedrich; that with the start of
him by twelve hours, they could not easily be overtaken; and, what was
more than all, that Serlo could not do without him at the theatre.</p>

<p>By so many reasons, Wilhelm was at last persuaded to postpone the
execution of his project. That night Laertes got an active man, to whom
they gave the charge of following the runaways. It was a steady person,
who had often officiated as courier and guide to travelling-parties, and
was at present without employment. They gave him money, they informed
him of the whole affair; instructing him to seek and overtake the
fugitives, to keep them in his eye, and instantly to send intelligence
to Wilhelm where and how he found them. That very hour he mounted horse,
pursuing this ambiguous pair; by which exertions, Wilhelm was in some
degree at least, composed.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p>The departure of Philina did not make a deep sensation, either in the
theatre or in the public. She never was in earnest with any thing: the
women universally detested her; the men rather wished to see her
selves-two than on the boards. Thus her fine, and, for the stage, even
happy, talents were of no avail to her. The other members of the company
took greater labor on them to supply her place: the Frau Melina, in
particular, was much distinguished by her diligence and zeal. She noted
down, as formerly, the principles of Wilhelm; she guided herself
according to his theory and his example; there was of late a something
in her nature that rendered her more interesting. She soon acquired an
accurate mode of acting: she attained the natural tone of conversation
altogether, that of keen emotion she attained in some degree. She
contrived, moreover, to adapt herself to Serlo's humors: she took pains
in singing for his pleasure, and succeeded in that matter moderately
well.</p>

<p>By the accession of some other players, the company was rendered more
complete: and while Wilhelm and Serlo were busied each in his degree,
the former insisting on the general tone and spirit of the whole, the
latter faithfully elaborating the separate passages, a laudable ardor
likewise inspired the actors; and the public took a lively interest in
their concerns.</p>

<p>"We are on the right path," said Serlo once: "if we can continue thus,
the public, too, will soon be on it. Men are easily astonished and
misled by wild and barbarous exhibitions; yet lay before them any thing
rational and polished, in an interesting manner, and doubt not they will
catch at it."</p>

<p>"What forms the chief defect of our German theatre, what prevents both
actor and spectator from obtaining proper views, is the vague and
variegated nature of the objects it contains. You nowhere find a barrier
on which to prop your judgment. In my opinion, it is far from an
advantage to us that we have expanded our stage into, as it were, a
boundless arena for the whole of nature; yet neither manager nor actor
need attempt contracting it, until the taste of the nation shall itself
mark out the proper circle. Every good society submits to certain
conditions and restrictions; so also must every good theatre. Certain
manners, certain modes of speech, certain objects, and fashions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
proceeding, must altogether be excluded. You do not grow poorer by
limiting your household expenditure."</p>

<p>On these points our friends were more or less accordant or at variance.
The majority, with Wilhelm at their head, were for the English theatre;
Serlo and a few others for the French.</p>

<p>It was also settled, that in vacant hours, of which unhappily an actor
has too many, they should in company peruse the finest plays in both
these languages; examining what parts of them seemed best and worthiest
of imitation. They accordingly commenced with some French pieces. On
these occasions, it was soon observed, Aurelia went away whenever they
began to read. At first they supposed she had been sick: Wilhelm once
questioned her about it.</p>

<p>"I would not assist at such a reading," said she, "for how could I hear
and judge, when my heart was torn in pieces? I hate the French language
from the bottom of my soul."</p>

<p>"How can you be hostile to a language," cried our friend, "to which we
Germans are indebted for the greater part of our accomplishments; to
which we must become indebted still more, if our natural qualities are
ever to assume their proper form?"</p>

<p>"It is no prejudice!" replied Aurelia, "a painful impression, a hated
recollection of my faithless friend, has robbed me of all enjoyment in
that beautiful and cultivated tongue. How I hate it now with my whole
strength and heart! During the period of our kindliest connection, he
wrote in German; and what genuine, powerful, cordial German! It was not
till he wanted to get quit of me that he began seriously to write in
French. I marked, I felt, what he meant. What he would have blushed to
utter in his mother tongue, he could by this means write with a quiet
conscience. It is the language of reservations, equivocations, and lies:
it is a <i>perfidious</i> language. Heaven be praised! I cannot find another
word to express this <i>perfide</i> of theirs in all its compass. Our poor
<i>treulos</i>, the <i>faithless</i> of the English, are innocent as babes beside
it. <i>Perfide</i> means faithless with pleasure, with insolence and malice.
How enviable is the culture of a nation that can figure out so many
shades of meaning by a single word! French is exactly the language of
the world,&mdash;worthy to become the universal language, that all may
have it in their power to cheat and cozen and betray each other! His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
French letters were always smooth and pleasant, while you read them. If
you chose to believe it, they sounded warmly, even passionately; but, if
you examined narrowly, they were but phrases,&mdash;accursed phrases! He
has spoiled my feeling to the whole language, to French literature, even
to the beautiful, delicious expressions of noble souls which may be
found in it. I shudder when a French word is spoken in my hearing."</p>

<p>In such terms she could for hours continue to give utterance to her
chagrin, interrupting or disturbing every other kind of conversation.
Sooner or later, Serlo used to put an end to such peevish lamentations
by some bitter sally; but by this means, commonly, the talk for the
evening was destroyed.</p>

<p>In all provinces of life, it is unhappily the case, that whatever is to
be accomplished by a number of co-operating men and circumstances cannot
long continue perfect. Of an acting company as well as of a kingdom, of
a circle of friends as well as of an army, you may commonly select the
moment when it may be said that all was standing on the highest pinnacle
of harmony, perfection, contentment, and activity. But alterations will
ere long occur; the individuals that compose the body often change; new
members are added; the persons are no longer suited to the
circumstances, or the circumstances to the persons; what was formerly
united quickly falls asunder. Thus it was with Serlo's company. For a
time you might have called it as complete as any German company could
ever boast of being. Most of the actors were occupying their proper
places: all had enough to do, and all did it willingly. Their private
personal condition was not bad; and each appeared to promise great
things in his art, for each commenced with animation and alacrity. But
it soon became apparent that a part of them were mere automatons, who
could not reach beyond what was attainable without the aid of feeling.
Nor was it long till grudgings and envyings arose among them, such as
commonly obstruct every good arrangement, and easily distort and tear in
pieces every thing that reasonable and thinking men would wish to keep
united.</p>

<p>The departure of Philina was not quite so insignificant as it had at
first appeared. She had always skilfully contrived to entertain the
manager, and keep the others in good humor. She had endured Aurelia's
violence with amazing patience, and her dearest task had been to flatter
Wilhelm. Thus she was, in some respects, a bond of union for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
whole: the loss of her was quickly felt.</p>

<p>Serlo could not live without some little passion of the love sort.
Elmira was of late grown up, we might almost say grown beautiful; for
some time she had been attracting his attention: and Philina, with her
usual dexterity, had favored this attachment so soon as she observed it.
"We should train ourselves in time," she would say, "to the business of
procuress: nothing else remains for us when we are old." Serlo and
Elmira had by this means so approximated to each other, that, shortly
after the departure of Philina, both were of a mind: and their small
romance was rendered doubly interesting, as they had to hide it
sedulously from the father; Old Boisterous not understanding jokes of
that description. Elmira's sister had been admitted to the secret; and
Serlo was, in consequence, obliged to overlook a multitude of things in
both of them. One of their worst habits was an excessive love of
junketing,&mdash;nay, if you will, an intolerable gluttony. In this
respect they altogether differed from Philina, to whom it gave a new
tint of loveliness, that she seemed, as it were, to live on air, eating
very little; and, for drink, merely skimming off, with all imaginable
grace, the foam from a glass of champagne.</p>

<p>Now, however, Serlo, if he meant to please his doxies, was obliged to
join breakfast with dinner; and with this, by a substantial bever, to
connect the supper. But, amid gormandizing, Serlo entertained another
plan, which he longed to have fulfilled. He imagined that he saw a kind
of attachment between Wilhelm and Aurelia, and he anxiously wished that
it might assume a serious shape. He hoped to cast the whole mechanical
department of his theatrical economy on Wilhelm's shoulders; to find in
him, as in the former brother, a faithful and industrious tool. Already
he had, by degrees, shifted over to him most of the cares of management;
Aurelia kept the strong-box; and Serlo once more lived as he had done of
old, entirely according to his humor. Yet there was a circumstance which
vexed him in secret, as it did his sister likewise.</p>

<p>The world has a particular way of acting towards public persons of
acknowledged merit: it gradually begins to be indifferent to them, and
to favor talents which are new, though far inferior; it makes excessive
requisitions of the former, and accepts of any thing with approbation
from the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>Serlo and Aurelia had opportunity enough to meditate on this
peculiarity. The strangers, especially the young and handsome ones, had
drawn the whole attention and applause upon themselves; and Serlo and
his sister, in spite of the most zealous efforts, had in general to make
their exits without the welcome sound of clapping hands. It is true,
some special causes were at work on this occasion. Aurelia's pride was
palpable, and her contempt for the public was known to many. Serlo,
indeed, flattered every individual; but his cutting jibes against the
whole were often circulated and repeated. The new members, again, were
not only strangers, unknown, and wanting help, but some of them were
likewise young and amiable: thus all of them found patrons.</p>

<p>Erelong, too, there arose internal discontents, and many bickerings,
among the actors. Scarcely had they noticed that our friend was acting
as director, when most of them began to grow the more remiss, the more
he strove to introduce a better order, greater accuracy, and chiefly to
insist that every thing mechanical should be performed in the most
strict and regular manner.</p>

<p>Thus, by and by, the whole concern, which actually for a time had nearly
looked ideal, grew as vulgar in its attributes as any mere itinerating
theatre. And, unhappily, just as Wilhelm, by his labor, diligence, and
vigorous efforts, had made himself acquainted with the requisitions of
the art, and trained completely both his person and his habits to comply
with them, he began to feel, in melancholy hours, that this craft
deserved the necessary outlay of time and talents less than any other.
The task was burdensome, the recompense was small. He would rather have
engaged with any occupation in which, when the period of exertion is
passed, one can enjoy repose of mind, than with this, wherein, after
undergoing much mechanical drudgery, the aim of one's activity cannot
still be attained but by the strongest effort of thought and emotion.
Besides, he had to listen to Aurelia's complaints about her brother's
wastefulness: he had to misconceive the winks and nods of Serlo, trying
from afar to lead him to a marriage with Aurelia. He had, withal, to
hide his own secret sorrow, which pressed heavy on his heart, because of
that ambiguous officer whom he had sent in quest of. The messenger
returned not, sent no tidings; and Wilhelm feared that his Mariana was
lost to him a second time.</p>

<p>About this period, there occurred a public mourning, which obliged our
friends to shut their theatre for several weeks. Wilhelm seized this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
opportunity to pay a visit to the clergyman with whom the harper had
been placed to board. He found him in a pleasant district; and the first
thing that he noticed in the parsonage was the old man teaching a boy to
play upon his instrument. The harper showed great joy at sight of
Wilhelm: he rose, held out his hand, and said, "You see, I am still good
for something in the world; permit me to continue; for my hours are all
distributed, and full of business."</p>

<p>The clergyman saluted Wilhelm very kindly, and told him that the harper
promised well, already giving hopes of a complete recovery.</p>

<p>Their conversation naturally turned upon the various modes of treating
the insane.</p>

<p>"Except physical derangements," observed the clergyman, "which often
place insuperable difficulties in the way, and in regard to which I
follow the prescriptions of a wise physician, the means of curing
madness seem to me extremely simple. They are the very means by which
you hinder sane persons from becoming mad. Awaken their activity;
accustom them to order; bring them to perceive that they hold their
being and their fate in common with many millions; that extraordinary
talents, the highest happiness, the deepest misery, are but slight
variations from the general lot: in this way, no insanity will enter,
or, if it has entered, will gradually disappear. I have portioned out
the old man's hours: he gives lessons to some children on the harp; he
works in the garden; he is already much more cheerful. He wishes to
enjoy the cabbages he plants: my son, to whom in case of death he has
bequeathed his harp, he is ardent to instruct, that the boy may be able
to make use of his inheritance. I have said but little to him, as a
clergyman, about his wild, mysterious scruples; but a busy life brings
on so many incidents, that erelong he must feel how true it is, that
doubt of any kind can be removed by nothing but activity. I go softly to
work: yet, if I could get his beard and hood removed, I should reckon it
a weighty point; for nothing more exposes us to madness than
distinguishing ourselves from others, and nothing more contributes to
maintain our common sense than living in the universal way with
multitudes of men. Alas! how much there is in education, in our social
institutions, to prepare us and our children for insanity!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>Wilhelm staid some days with this intelligent divine; heard from him
many curious narratives, not of the insane alone, but of persons such as
commonly are reckoned wise and rational, though they may have
peculiarities which border on insanity.</p>

<p>The conversation became doubly animated, on the entrance of the doctor,
with whom it was a custom to pay frequent visits to his friend the
clergyman, and to assist him in his labors of humanity. The physician
was an oldish man, who, though in weak health, had spent many years in
the practice of the noblest virtues. He was a strong advocate for
country life, being himself scarcely able to exist except in the open
air. Withal, he was extremely active and companionable. For several
years he had shown a special inclination to make friends with all the
country clergymen within his reach. Such of these as were employed in
any useful occupation he strove by every means to help; into others, who
were still unsettled in their aims, he endeavored to infuse a taste for
some profitable species of exertion. Being at the same time in
connection with a multitude of noblemen, magistrates, judges, he had in
the space of twenty years, in secret, accomplished much towards the
advancement of many branches of husbandry: he had done his best to put
in motion every project that seemed capable of benefiting agriculture,
animals, or men, and had thus forwarded improvement in its truest sense.
"For man," he used to say, "there is but one misfortune,&mdash;when some
idea lays hold of him, which exerts no influence upon active life, or,
still more, which withdraws him from it. At the present time," continued
he, on this occasion, "I have such a case before me: it concerns a rich
and noble couple, and hitherto has baffled all my skill. The affair
belongs in part to your department, worthy pastor; and your friend here
will forbear to mention it again.</p>

<p>"In the absence of a certain nobleman, some persons of the house, in a
frolic not entirely commendable, disguised a young man in the master's
clothes. The lady was to be imposed upon by this deception; and,
although it was described to me as nothing but a joke, I am much afraid
the purpose of it was to lead this noble and most amiable lady from the
path of honor. Her husband, however, unexpectedly returns; enters his
chamber; thinks he sees his spirit; and from that time falls into a
melancholy temper, firmly believing that his death is near.</p>

<p>"He has now abandoned himself to men who pamper him with religious
ideas; and I see not how he is to be prevented from going among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Hernhuters with his lady, and, as he has no children, from depriving his
relations of the chief part of his fortune."</p>

<p>"With his lady?" cried our friend in great agitation; for this story had
frightened him extremely.</p>

<p>"And, alas!" replied the doctor, who regarded Wilhelm's exclamation only
as the voice of common sympathy, "this lady is herself possessed with a
deeper sorrow, which renders a removal from the world desirable to her
also. The same young man was taking leave of her: she was not
circumspect enough to hide a nascent inclination towards him: the youth
grew bolder, clasped her in his arms, and pressed a large portrait of
her husband, which was set with diamonds, forcibly against her breast.
She felt a sharp pain, which gradually went off, leaving first a little
redness, then no trace at all. As a man, I am convinced that she has
nothing further to reproach herself with, in this affair; as a
physician, I am certain that this pressure could not have the smallest
ill effect. Yet she will not be persuaded that an induration is not
taking place in the part; and, if you try to overcome her notion by the
evidence of feeling, she maintains, that, though the evil is away this
moment, it will return the next. She conceives that the disease will end
in cancer, and thus her youth and loveliness be altogether lost to
others and herself."</p>

<p>"Wretch that I am!" cried Wilhelm, striking his brow, and rushing from
the company into the fields. He had never felt himself in such a
miserable case.</p>

<p>The clergyman and the physician were of course exceedingly astonished at
this singular discovery. In the evening all their skill was called for,
when our friend returned, and, with a circumstantial disclosure of the
whole occurrence, uttered the most violent accusations of himself. Both
took interest in him: both felt a real concern about his general
condition, particularly as he painted it in the gloomy colors which
arose from the humor of the moment.</p>

<p>Next day the physician, without much entreaty, was prevailed upon to
accompany him in his return; both that he might bear him company, and
that he might, if possible, do something for Aurelia, whom our friend
had left in rather dangerous circumstances.</p>

<p>In fact, they found her worse than they expected. She was afflicted with
a sort of intermittent fever, which could the less be mastered, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
she purposely maintained and aggravated the attacks of it. The stranger
was not introduced as a physician: he behaved with great courteousness
and prudence. They conversed about her situation, bodily and mental: her
new friend related many anecdotes of persons who, in spite of lingering
disorders, had attained a good old age; adding, that, in such cases,
nothing could be more injurious than the intentional recalling of
passionate and disagreeable emotions. In particular he stated, that, for
persons laboring under chronical and partly incurable distempers, he had
always found it a very happy circumstance when they chanced to
entertain, and cherish in their minds, true feelings of religion. This
he signified in the most unobtrusive manner, as it were historically;
promising Aurelia at the same time the reading of a very interesting
manuscript, which he said he had received from the hands of an excellent
lady of his friends, who was now deceased. "To me," he said, "it is of
uncommon value; and I shall trust you even with the original. Nothing
but the title is in my hand-writing: I have called it, 'Confessions of a
Fair Saint.'"</p>

<p>Touching the medical and dietetic treatment of the racked and hapless
patient, he also left his best advice with Wilhelm. He then departed;
promising to write, and, if possible, to come again in person.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Wilhelm's absence, there had changes been preparing such
as he was not aware of. During his directorship, our friend had managed
all things with a certain liberality and freedom; looking chiefly at the
main result. Whatever was required for dresses, decorations, and the
like, he had usually provided in a plentiful and handsome style; and,
for securing the co-operation of his people, he had flattered their
self-interest, since he could not reach them by nobler motives. In this
he felt his conduct justified the more; as Serlo for his own part never
aimed at being a strict economist, but liked to hear the beauty of his
theatre commended, and was contented if Aurelia, who conducted the
domestic matters, on defraying all expenses, signified that she was free
from debt, and could besides afford the necessary sums for clearing off
such scores as Serlo in the interim, by lavish kindness to his
mistresses or otherwise, might have incurred.</p>

<p>Melina, who was charged with managing the wardrobe, had all the while
been silently considering these things, with the cold, spiteful temper
peculiar to him. On occasion of our friend's departure, and Aurelia's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
increasing sickness, he contrived to signify to Serlo, that more money
might be raised and less expended, and, consequently, something be laid
up, or at least a merrier life be led. Serlo hearkened gladly to such
allegations, and Melina risked the exhibition of his plan.</p>

<p>"I will not say," continued he, "that any of your actors has at present
too much salary: they are meritorious people, they would find a welcome
anywhere; but, for the income which they bring us in, they have too
much. My project would be, to set up an opera; and, as to what concerns
the playhouse, I may be allowed to say it, you are the person for
maintaining that establishment upon your single strength. Observe how at
present your merits are neglected; and justice is refused you, not
because your fellow-actors are excellent, but merely good.</p>

<p>"Come out alone, as used to be the case; endeavor to attract around you
middling, I will even say inferior people, for a slender salary; regale
the public with mechanical displays, as you can so cleverly do; apply
your remaining means to the opera, which I am talking of; and you will
quickly see, that, with the same labor and expense, you will give
greater satisfaction, while you draw incomparably more money than at
present."</p>

<p>These observations were so flattering to Serlo, that they could not fail
of making some impression on him. He readily admitted, that, loving
music as he did, he had long wished for some arrangement such as this;
though he could not but perceive that the public taste would thus be
still more widely led astray, and that with such a mongrel theatre, not
properly an opera, not properly a playhouse, any residue of true feeling
for regular and perfect works of art must shortly disappear.</p>

<p>Melina ridiculed, in terms more plain than delicate, our friend's
pedantic notions in this matter, and his vain attempts to form the
public mind, instead of being formed by it: Serlo and he at last agreed,
with full conviction, that the sole concern was, how to gather money,
and grow rich, or live a joyous life; and they scarcely concealed their
wish to be delivered from those persons who at present hindered them.
Melina took occasion to lament Aurelia's weak health, and the speedy end
which it threatened; thinking all the while directly the reverse. Serlo
affected to regret that Wilhelm could not sing, thus signifying that his
presence was by no means indispensable. Melina then came forward with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
a whole catalogue of savings, which, he said, might be effected; and
Serlo saw in him his brother-in-law replaced threefold. They both felt
that secrecy was necessary in the matter, but this mutual obligation
only joined them closer in their interests. They failed not to converse
together privately on every thing that happened; to blame whatever
Wilhelm or Aurelia undertook; and to elaborate their own project, and
prepare it more and more for execution.</p>

<p>Silent as they both might be about their plan, little as their words
betrayed them, in their conduct they were not so politic as constantly
to hide their purposes. Melina now opposed our friend in many points
that lay within the province of the latter; and Serlo, who had never
acted smoothly to his sister, seemed to grow more bitter the more her
sickness deepened, the more her passionate and variable humors would
have needed toleration.</p>

<p>About this period they took up the "Emilie Galotti" of Lessing. The
parts were very happily distributed and filled: within the narrow circle
of this tragedy, the company found room for showing all the complex
riches of their acting. Serlo, in the character of Marinelli, was
altogether in his place; Odoardo was very well exhibited; Madam Melina
played the Mother with considerable skill; Elmira gained distinction as
Emilie; Laertes made a stately Appiani; and Wilhelm had bestowed the
study of some months upon the Prince's part. On this occasion, both
internally and with Aurelia and Serlo, he had often come upon this
question: What is the distinction between a noble and a well-bred
manner? and how far must the former be included in the latter, though
the latter is not in the former?</p>

<p>Serlo, who himself in Marinelli had to act the courtier accurately,
without caricature, afforded him some valuable thoughts on this. "A
well-bred carriage," he would say, is difficult to imitate; for in
strictness it is negative, and it implies a long-continued previous
training. You are not required to exhibit in your manner any thing that
specially betokens dignity; for, by this means, you are like to run into
formality and haughtiness: you are rather to avoid whatever is
undignified and vulgar. You are never to forget yourself; are to keep a
constant watch upon yourself and others; to forgive nothing that is
faulty in your own conduct, in that of others neither to forgive too
little nor too much. Nothing must appear to touch you, nothing to
agitate: you must never overhaste yourself, must ever keep yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
composed, retaining still an outward calmness, whatever storms may rage
within. The noble character at certain moments may resign himself to his
emotions; the well-bred never. The latter is like a man dressed out in
fair and spotless clothes: he will not lean on any thing; every person
will beware of rubbing on him. He distinguishes himself from others, yet
he may not stand apart; for as in all arts, so in this, the hardest must
at length be done with ease: the well-bred man of rank, in spite of
every separation, always seems united with the people round him; he is
never to be stiff or uncomplying; he is always to appear the first, and
never to insist on so appearing.</p>

<p>"It is clear, then, that, to seem well-bred, a man must actually be so.
It is also clear why women generally are more expert at taking up the
air of breeding than the other sex; why courtiers and soldiers catch it
more easily than other men."</p>

<p>Wilhelm now despaired of doing justice to his part; but Serlo aided and
encouraged him, communicated the acutest observations on detached
points, and furnished him so well, that, on the exhibition of the piece,
the public reckoned him a very proper Prince.</p>

<p>Serlo had engaged to give him, when the play was over, such remarks as
might occur upon his acting: a disagreeable contention with Aurelia
prevented any conversation of that kind. Aurelia had acted the character
of Orsina, in such a style as few have ever done. She was well
acquainted with the part, and during the rehearsals she had treated it
indifferently: but, in the exhibition of the piece, she had opened, as
it were, all the sluices of her personal sorrow; and the character was
represented so as never poet in the first glow of invention could have
figured it. A boundless applause rewarded her painful efforts; but her
friends, on visiting her when the play was finished, found her half
fainting in her chair.</p>

<p>Serlo had already signified his anger at her overcharged acting, as he
called it; at this disclosure of her inmost heart before the public, to
many individuals of which the history of her fatal passion was more or
less completely known. He had spoken bitterly and fiercely; grinding
with his teeth and stamping with his feet, as was his custom when
enraged. "Never mind her," cried he, when he saw her in the chair,
surrounded by the rest: "she will go upon the stage stark-naked one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
of these days, and then the approbation will be perfect."</p>

<p>"Ungrateful, inhuman man!" exclaimed she: "soon shall I be carried naked
to the place where approbation or disapprobation can no longer reach our
ears!" With these words she started up, and hastened to the door. The
maid had not yet brought her mantle; the sedan was not in waiting; it
had been raining lately; a cold, raw wind was blowing through the
streets. They endeavored to persuade her to remain, for she was very
warm. But in vain: she purposely walked slow; she praised the coolness,
seemed to inhale it with peculiar eagerness. No sooner was she home,
than she became so hoarse that she could hardly speak a word: she did
not mention that there was a total stiffness in her neck and along her
back. Shortly afterwards a sort of palsy in the tongue came on, so that
she pronounced one word instead of another. They put her to bed: by
numerous and copious remedies, the evil changed its form, but was not
mastered. The fever gathered strength: her case was dangerous.</p>

<p>Next morning she enjoyed a quiet hour. She sent for Wilhelm, and
delivered him a letter. "This sheet," said she, "has long been waiting
for the present moment. I feel that my end is drawing nigh: promise me
that you yourself will take this paper; that, by a word or two, you will
avenge my sorrows on the faithless man. He is not void of feeling: my
death will pain him for a moment."</p>

<p>Wilhelm took the letter; still endeavoring to console her, and to drive
away the thought of death.</p>

<p>"No," said she: "do not deprive me of my nearest hope. I have waited for
him long: I will joyfully clasp him when he comes."</p>

<p>Shortly after this the manuscript arrived which the physician had
engaged to send her. She called for Wilhelm,&mdash;made him read it to
her. The effect which it produced upon her, the reader will be better
able to appreciate after looking at the following Book. The violent and
stubborn temper of our poor Aurelia was mollified by hearing it. She
took back the letter, and wrote another, as it seemed, in a meeker tone;
charging Wilhelm at the same time to console her friend, if he should be
distressed about her death; to assure him that she had forgiven him, and
wished him every kind of happiness.</p>

<p>From this time she was very quiet, and appeared to occupy herself
with but a few ideas, which she endeavored to extract and appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
from the manuscript, out of which she frequently made Wilhelm read to
her. The decay of her strength was not perceptible: nor had Wilhelm been
anticipating the event, when one morning, as he went to visit her, he
found that she was dead.</p>

<p>Entertaining such respect for her as he had done, and accustomed as he
was to live in her society, the loss of her affected him with no common
sorrow. She was the only person that had truly wished him well: the
coldness of Serlo he had felt of late but too keenly. He hastened,
therefore, to perform the service she had intrusted to him: he wished to
be absent for a time.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this journey was exceedingly convenient for Melina:
in the course of his extensive correspondence, he had lately entered
upon terms with a male and a female singer, who, it was intended,
should, by their performances in interludes, prepare the public for his
future opera. The loss of Aurelia, and Wilhelm's absence, were to be
supplied in this manner; and our friend was satisfied with any thing
that could facilitate his setting out.</p>

<p>He had formed, within himself, a singular idea of the importance of his
errand. The death of his unhappy friend had moved him deeply; and,
having seen her pass so early from the scene, he could not but be
hostilely inclined against the man who had abridged her life, and made
that shortened term so full of woe.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the last mild words of the dying woman, he resolved,
that, on delivering his letter, he would pass a strict sentence on her
faithless friend; and, not wishing to depend upon the temper of the
moment, he studied an address, which, in the course of preparation,
became more pathetic than just. Having fully convinced himself of the
good composition of his essay, he began committing it to memory, and at
the same time making ready for departure. Mignon was present as he
packed his articles: she asked him whether he intended travelling south
or north; and, learning that it was the latter, she replied, "Then, I
will wait here for thee." She begged of him the pearl necklace which had
once been Mariana's. He could not refuse to gratify the dear little
creature, and he gave it her: the neckerchief she had already. On the
other hand, she put the veil of Hamlet's Ghost into his travelling-bag;
though he told her it could not be of any service to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>Melina took upon him the directorship: his wife engaged to keep a
mother's eye upon the children, whom Wilhelm parted with unwillingly.
Felix was very merry at the setting out; and, when asked what pretty
thing he wished to have brought back for him, he said, "Hark you! bring
me a papa!" Mignon seized the traveller's hand; then, standing on her
tiptoes, she pressed a warm and cordial, though not a tender, kiss, upon
his lips, and cried, "Master! forget us not, and come soon back."</p>

<p>And so we leave our friend, entering on his journey, amid a thousand
different thoughts and feelings; and here subjoin, by way of close, a
little poem, which Mignon had recited once or twice with great
expressiveness, and which the hurry of so many singular occurrences
prevented us from inserting sooner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">"Not speech, bid silence, I implore thee;</span>
  <span class="i3">For secrecy's my duty still:</span>
  <span class="i2">My heart entire I'd fain lay bare before thee,</span>
  <span class="i3">But such is not of fate the will.</span>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">In season due the sun's course backward throws</span>
  <span class="i3">Dark night; ensue must light; the mountain's</span>
  <span class="i2">Hard rock, at length, its bosom doth unclose,</span>
  <span class="i3">Now grudging earth no more the hidden fountains.</span>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">Each seeks repose upon a friend's true breast,</span>
  <span class="i3">Where by laments he frees his bosom lonely;</span>
  <span class="i2">Whereas an oath my lips hold closely pressed,</span>
  <span class="i3">The which to speech a God can open only."</span>

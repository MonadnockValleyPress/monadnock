<h1>Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship</h1>
<h2>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</h2>
<h3>Translated by Thomas Carlyle (1839)</h3>
<h3>BOOK VI</h3>
<h3>Confessions of a Fair Saint</h3>

<p>Till my eighth year I was always a healthy child, but of that period I
can recollect no more than of the day when I was born. About the
beginning of my eighth year, I was seized with a hemorrhage; and from
that moment my soul became all feeling, all memory. The smallest
circumstances of that accident are yet before my eyes as if they had
occurred but yesterday.</p>

<p>During the nine months which I then spent patiently upon a sick-bed, it
appears to me the groundwork of my whole turn of thought was laid; as
the first means were then afforded my mind of developing itself in its
own manner.</p>

<p>I suffered and I loved: this was the peculiar form of my heart. In the
most violent fits of coughing, in the depressing pains of fever, I lay
quiet, like a snail drawn back within its house: the moment I obtained a
respite, I wanted to enjoy something pleasant; and, as every other
pleasure was denied me, I endeavored to amuse myself with the innocent
delights of eye and ear. The people brought me dolls and picture-books,
and whoever would sit by my bed was obliged to tell me something.</p>

<p>From my mother I rejoiced to hear the Bible histories, and my father
entertained me with natural curiosities. He had a very pretty cabinet,
from which he brought me first one drawer and then another, as occasion
served; showing me the articles, and pointing out their properties.
Dried plants and insects, with many kinds of anatomical preparations,
such as human skin, bones, mummies, and the like, were in succession
laid upon the sick-bed of the little one; the birds and animals he
killed in hunting were shown to me, before they passed into the kitchen;
and, that the Prince of the World might also have a voice in this
assembly, my aunt related to me love-adventures out of fairy-tales. All
was accepted, all took root. There were hours in which I vividly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
conversed with the Invisible Power. I can still repeat some verses which
I then dictated, and my mother wrote down.</p>

<p>Often I would tell my father back again what I had learned from him.
Rarely did I take any physic without asking where the simples it was
made of grew, what look they had, what names they bore. Nor had the
stories of my aunt lighted on stony ground. I figured myself out in
pretty clothes, and met the most delightful princes, who could find no
peace or rest till they discovered who the unknown beauty was. One
adventure of this kind, with a charming little angel dressed in white,
with golden wings, who warmly courted me, I dwelt upon so long, that my
imagination painted out his form almost to visibility.</p>

<p>After a year I was pretty well restored to health, but nothing of the
giddiness of childhood remained with me. I could not play with dolls: I
longed for beings able to return my love. Dogs, cats, and birds, of
which my father kept a great variety, afforded me delight; but what
would I have given for such a creature as my aunt once told me of! It
was a lamb which a peasant-girl took up and nourished in a wood; but, in
the guise of this pretty beast, an enchanted prince was hid, who at
length appeared in his native shape, a lovely youth, and rewarded his
benefactress by his hand. Such a lamb I would have given the world for.</p>

<p>But there was none to be had; and, as every thing about me went on in
such a quite natural manner, I by degrees all but abandoned nearly all
hopes of such a treasure. Meanwhile I comforted myself by reading books
in which the strangest incidents were set forth. Among them all, my
favorite was the "Christian German Hercules:" that devout love-history
was altogether in my way. Whenever any thing befell his dear Valiska,
and cruel things befell her, he always prayed before hastening to her
aid; and the prayers stood there <i>verbatim</i>. My longing after the
Invisible, which I had always dimly felt, was strengthened by such
means; for, in short, it was ordained that God should also be my
confidant.</p>

<p>As I grew older I continued reading, Heaven knows what, in chaotic
order. The "Roman Octavia" was the book I liked beyond all others. The
persecutions of the first Christians, decorated with the charms of a
romance, awoke the deepest interest in me.</p>

<p>But my mother now began to murmur at my constant reading; and, to
humor her, my father took away my books to-day, but gave them back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
to-morrow. She was wise enough to see that nothing could be done in this
way: she next insisted merely that my Bible should be read with equal
diligence. To this I was not disinclined, and I accordingly perused the
sacred volume with a lively interest. Withal my mother was extremely
careful that no books of a corruptive tendency should come into my
hands: immodest writings I would, of my own accord, have cast away; for
my princes and my princesses were all extremely virtuous.</p>

<p>To my mother, and my zeal for knowledge, it was owing, that, with all my
love of books, I also learned to cook; for much was to be seen in
cookery. To cut up a hen, a pig, was quite a feast for me. I used to
bring the entrails to my father, and he talked with me about them as if
I had been a student of anatomy. With suppressed joy he would often call
me his misfashioned son.</p>

<p>I had passed my twelfth year. I learned French, dancing, and drawing: I
received the usual instructions in religion. In the latter, many
thoughts and feelings were awakened, but nothing properly relating to my
own condition. I liked to hear the people speak of God: I was proud that
I could speak on these points better than my equals. I zealously read
many books which put me in a condition to talk about religion; but it
never once struck me to think how matters stood with <i>me</i>, whether <i>my</i>
soul was formed according to these holy precepts, whether it was like a
glass from which the everlasting sun could be reflected in its glancing.
From the first I had presupposed all this.</p>

<p>My French I learned with eagerness. My teacher was a clever man. He was
not a vain empiric, not a dry grammarian: he had learning, he had seen
the world. Instructing me in language, he satisfied my zeal for
knowledge in a thousand ways. I loved him so much, that I used to wait
his coming with a palpitating heart. Drawing was not hard for me: I
should have made greater progress had my teacher possessed head and
science; he had only hands and practice.</p>

<p>Dancing was at first one of my smallest amusements; my body was too
sensitive for it; I learned it only in the company of my sisters. But
our dancing-master took a thought of gathering all his scholars, male
and female, and giving them a ball. This event gave dancing quite
another charm for me.</p>

<p>Amid a throng of boys and girls, the most remarkable were two sons of
the marshal of the court. The youngest was of my age; the other, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
years older: they were children of such beauty, that, according to the
universal voice, no one had seen their like. For my part, scarcely had I
noticed them when I lost sight of all the other crowd. From that moment
I began to dance with care, and to wish that I could dance with grace.
How came it, on the other hand, that these two boys distinguished me
from all the rest? No matter: before an hour had passed we had become
the warmest friends, and our little entertainment did not end till we
had fixed upon the time and place where we were next to meet. What a joy
for me! And how charmed was I next morning when both of them inquired
for my health, each in a gallant note, accompanied with a nosegay! I
have never since felt as I then did. Compliment was met by compliment:
letter answered letter. The church and the public-walks were grown a
rendezvous; our young acquaintances, in all their little parties, now
invited us together; while, at the same time, we were sly enough to veil
the business from our parents, so that they saw no more of it than we
thought good.</p>

<p>Thus had I at once got a pair of lovers. I had yet decided upon neither:
they both pleased me, and we did extremely well together. All at once
the eldest of the two fell very sick. I myself had often been sick; and
thus I was enabled, by rendering him many little dainties and delicacies
suited for a sick person, to afford some solace to the sufferer. His
parents thankfully acknowledged my attention: in compliance with the
prayer of their beloved son, they invited me, with all my sisters, to
their house so soon as he had arisen from his sick-bed. The tenderness
which he displayed on meeting me was not the feeling of a child: from
that day I gave the preference to him. He warned me to keep our secret
from his brother; but the flame could no longer be concealed, and the
jealousy of the younger completed our romance. He played us a thousand
tricks: eager to annihilate our joys, he but increased the passion he
was seeking to destroy.</p>

<p>At last I had actually found the wished-for lamb, and this attachment
acted on me like my sickness: it made me calm, and drew me back from
noisy pleasures. I was solitary, I was moved; and thoughts of God again
occurred to me. He was again my confidant; and I well remember with what
tears I often prayed for this poor boy, who still continued sickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>The more childishness there was in this adventure, the more did it
contribute to the forming of my heart. Our French teacher had now turned
us from translating into daily writing him some letter of our own
invention. I brought my little history to market, shrouded in the names
of Phyllis and Damon. The old man soon saw through it, and, to render me
communicative, praised my labor very much. I still waxed bolder; came
openly out with the affair, adhering, even in the minute details, to
truth. I do not now remember what the passage was at which he took
occasion to remark, "How pretty, how natural, it is! But the good
Phyllis had better have a care: the thing may soon grow serious."</p>

<p>I felt vexed that he did not look upon the matter as already serious;
and I asked him, with an air of pique, what he meant by serious. I had
not to repeat the question: he explained himself so clearly, that I
could scarcely hide my terror. Yet as anger came along with it, as I
took it ill that he should entertain such thoughts, I kept myself
composed: I tried to justify my nymph, and said, with glowing cheeks,
"But, sir, Phyllis is an honorable girl."</p>

<p>He was rogue enough to banter me about my honorable heroine. While we
were speaking French, he played upon the word <i>honnête</i>, and hunted the
honorableness of Phyllis over all its meanings. I felt the ridicule of
this, and extremely puzzled. He, not to frighten me, broke off, but
afterwards often led the conversation to such topics. Plays, and little
histories, such as I was reading and translating with him, gave him
frequent opportunity to show how feeble a security against the calls of
inclination our boasted virtue was. I no longer contradicted him, but I
was in secret scandalized; and his remarks became a burden to me.</p>

<p>With my worthy Damon, too, I by degrees fell out of all connection. The
chicanery of the younger boy destroyed our intercourse. Soon after, both
these blooming creatures died. I lamented sore: however, in a short
time, I forgot.</p>

<p>But Phyllis rapidly increased in stature, was altogether healthy, and
began to see the world. The hereditary prince now married, and a short
time after, on his father's death, began his rule. Court and town were
in the liveliest motion: my curiosity had copious nourishment. There
were plays and balls, with all their usual accompaniments; and, though
my parents kept retired as much as possible, they were obliged to show
themselves at court, where I was of course introduced. Strangers were
pouring in from every side; high company was in every house; even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
us some cavaliers were recommended, others introduced; and, at my
uncle's, men of every nation might be met with.</p>

<p>My honest mentor still continued, in a modest and yet striking way, to
warn me, and I in secret to take it ill of him. With regard to his
assertion, that women under every circumstance were weak, I did not feel
at all convinced; and here, perhaps, I was in the right, and my mentor
in the wrong: but he spoke so earnestly that once I grew afraid he might
be right, and said to him, with much vivacity, "Since the danger is so
great, and the human heart so weak, I will pray to God that he may keep
me."</p>

<p>This simple answer seemed to please him, for he praised my purpose;
but, on my side, it was any thing but seriously meant. It was, in truth,
but an empty word; for my feelings towards the Invisible were almost
totally extinguished. The hurry and the crowd I lived in dissipated my
attention, and carried me along as in a rapid stream. These were the
emptiest years of my life. All day long to speak of nothing, to have no
solid thought, never to do any thing but revel,&mdash;such was my
employment. On my beloved books I never once bestowed a thought. The
people I lived among had not the slightest tinge of literature or
science: they were German courtiers, a class of men at that time
altogether destitute of culture.</p>

<p>Such society, it may be thought, must naturally have led me to the brink
of ruin. I lived away in mere corporeal cheerfulness: I never took
myself to task, I never prayed, I never thought about myself or God. Yet
I look upon it as a providential guidance, that none of these many
handsome, rich, and well-dressed men could take my fancy. They were
rakes, and did not conceal it; this scared me back: they adorned their
speech with double meanings; this offended me, made me act with coldness
towards them. Many times their improprieties exceeded belief, and I did
not restrain myself from being rude.</p>

<p>Besides, my ancient counsellor had once in confidence contrived to tell
me, that, with the greater part of these lewd fellows, health, as well
as virtue, was in danger. I now shuddered at the sight of them: I was
afraid if one of them in any way approached too near me. I would not
touch their cups or glasses,&mdash;even the chairs they had been sitting
on. Thus, morally and physically, I remained apart from them: all the
compliments they paid me I haughtily accepted, as incense that was due.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the strangers then resident among us was one young man peculiarly
distinguished, whom we used in sport to call Narciss. He had gained a
reputation in the diplomatic line; and, among the various changes now
occurring at court, he was in hopes of meeting with some advantageous
place. He soon became acquainted with my father: his acquirements and
manners opened for him the way to a select society of most accomplished
men. My father often spoke in praise of him: his figure, which was very
handsome, would have made a still better impression, had it not been for
something of self-complacency which breathed from the whole carriage of
the man. I had seen him. I thought well of him; but we had never spoken.</p>

<p>At a great ball, where we chanced to be in company, I danced a minuet
with him; but this, too, passed without results. The more violent
dances, in compliance with my father, who felt anxious about my health,
I was accustomed to avoid: in the present case, when these came on, I
retired to an adjoining room, and began to talk with certain of my
friends, elderly ladies, who had set themselves to cards.</p>

<p>Narciss, who had jigged it for a while, at last came into the room where
I was; and having got the better of a bleeding at the nose, which had
overtaken him in dancing, he began speaking with me about a multitude of
things. In half an hour the talk had grown so interesting, that neither
of us could think of dancing any more. We were rallied by our friends,
but we did not let their bantering disturb us. Next evening we
recommenced our conversation, and were very careful not to hurt our
health.</p>

<p>The acquaintance then was made. Narciss was often with my sisters and
myself; and I now once more began to reckon over and consider what I
knew, what I thought of, what I had felt, and what I could express
myself about in conversation. My new friend had mingled in the best
society; besides the department of history and politics, with every part
of which he was familiar, he had gained extensive literary knowledge;
there was nothing new that issued from the press, especially in France,
that he was unacquainted with. He brought or sent me many a pleasant
book, but this we had to keep as secret as forbidden love. Learned
women had been made ridiculous, nor were well-informed women
tolerated,&mdash;apparently because it would have been uncivil to put so
many ill-informed men to shame. Even my father, much as he delighted in
this new opportunity of cultivating my mind, expressly stipulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
that our literary commerce should remain secret.</p>

<p>Thus our intercourse continued for almost year and day; and still I
could not say, that, in any wise, Narciss had ever shown me aught of
love or tenderness. He was always complaisant and kind, but manifested
nothing like attachment: on the contrary, he even seemed to be in some
degree affected by the charms of my youngest sister, who was then
extremely beautiful. In sport, he gave her many little friendly names
out of foreign tongues; for he could speak two or three of these
extremely well, and loved to mix their idiomatic phrases with his
German. Such compliments she did not answer very liberally; she was
entangled in a different noose: and being very sharp, while he was very
sensitive, the two were often quarrelling about trifles. With my mother
and my aunt he kept on very pleasant terms; and thus, by gradual
advances, he was grown to be a member of the family.</p>

<p>Who knows how long we might have lived in this way, had not a curious
accident altered our relations all at once? My sisters and I were
invited to a certain house, to which we did not like to go. The company
was too mixed; and persons of the stupidest, if not the rudest, stamp
were often to be met there. Narciss, on this occasion, was invited also;
and on his account I felt inclined to go, for I was sure of finding one,
at least, whom I could converse with as I desired. Even at table we had
many things to suffer, for several of the gentlemen had drunk too much:
then, in the drawing-room, they insisted on a game at forfeits. It went
on with great vivacity and tumult. Narciss had lost a forfeit: they
ordered him, by way of penalty, to whisper something pleasant in the ear
of every member of the company. It seems he staid too long beside my
next neighbor, the lady of a captain. The latter on a sudden struck him
such a box with his fist, that the powder flew about me, into my eyes.
When I had got my eyes cleared, and in some degree recovered from my
terror, I saw that both gentlemen had drawn their swords. Narciss was
bleeding; and the other, mad with wine and rage and jealousy, could
scarcely be held back by all the company. I seized Narciss, led him by
the arm up-stairs; and, as I did not think my friend safe even here from
his frantic enemy, I shut the door and bolted it.</p>

<p>Neither of us considered the wound serious, for a slight cut across the
hand was all we saw. Soon, however, I discovered that there was a stream
of blood running down his back, that there was a deep wound on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
head. I now began to be afraid. I hastened to the lobby, to get help:
but I could see no person; every one had staid below to calm the raving
captain. At last a daughter of the family came skipping up: her mirth
annoyed me; she was like to die with laughing at the bedlam spectacle. I
conjured her, for the sake of Heaven, to get a surgeon; and she, in her
wild way, sprang down-stairs to fetch me one herself.</p>

<p>Returning to my wounded friend, I bound my handkerchief about his hand,
and a neckerchief, that was hanging on the door, about his head. He was
still bleeding copiously: he now grew pale, and seemed as if he were
about to faint. There was none at hand to aid me: I very freely put my
arm round him, patted his cheek, and tried to cheer him by little
flatteries. It seemed to act on him like a spiritual remedy: he kept his
senses, but sat as pale as death.</p>

<p>At last the active housewife arrived: it is easy to conceive her terror
when she saw my friend in this predicament, lying in my arms, and both
of us bestreamed with blood. No one had supposed he was wounded: all
imagined I had carried him away in safety.</p>

<p>Now smelling-bottles, wine, and every thing that could support and
stimulate, were copiously produced. The surgeon also came, and I might
easily have been dispensed with. Narciss, however, held me firmly by the
hand: I would have staid without holding. During the dressing of his
wounds, I continued wetting his lips with wine: I minded not, though all
the company were now about us. The surgeon having finished, his patient
took a mute but tender leave of me, and was conducted home.</p>

<p>The mistress of the house now led me to her bedroom: she had to strip me
altogether; and I must confess, while they washed the blood from me, I
saw with pleasure, for the first time, in a mirror, that I might be
reckoned beautiful without help of dress. No portion of my clothes could
be put on again; and, as the people of the house were all either less or
larger than myself, I was taken home in a strange disguise. My parents
were, of course, astonished. They felt exceedingly indignant at my
fright, at the wounds of their friend, at the captain's madness, at the
whole occurrence. A very little would have made my father send the
captain a challenge, that he might avenge his friend without delay. He
blamed the gentlemen that had been there, because they had not punished
on the spot such a murderous attempt; for it was but too clear, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
the captain, instantly on striking, had drawn his sword, and wounded the
other from behind. The cut across the hand had been given just when
Narciss himself was grasping at his sword. I felt unspeakably affected,
altered; or how shall I express it? The passion which was sleeping at
the deepest bottom of my heart had at once broken loose, like a flame
getting air. And if joy and pleasure are well suited for the first
producing and the silent nourishing of love, yet this passion, bold by
nature, is most easily impelled by terror to decide and to declare
itself. My mother gave her little flurried daughter some medicine, and
made her go to bed. With the earliest morrow my father hastened to
Narciss, whom he found lying very sick of a wound-fever.</p>

<p>He told me little of what passed between them, but tried to quiet me
about the probable results of this event. They were now considering
whether an apology should be accepted, whether the affair should go
before a court of justice, and many other points of that description. I
knew my father too well to doubt that he would be averse to see the
matter end without a duel: but I held my peace; for I had learned from
him before, that women should not meddle in such things. For the rest,
it did not strike me as if any thing had passed between the friends, in
which my interests were specially concerned; but my father soon
communicated to my mother the purport of their further conversation.
Narciss, he said, appeared to be exceedingly affected at the help
afforded by me; had embraced him, declared himself my debtor forever,
signified that he desired no happiness except what he could share with
me, and concluded by entreating that he might presume to ask my hand.
All this mamma repeated to me, but subjoined the safe reflection, that,
"as for what was said in the first agitation of mind in such a case,
there was little trust to be placed in it."&mdash;"Of course, none," I
answered with affected coldness; though all the while I was feeling,
Heaven knows what.</p>

<p>Narciss continued sick for two months; owing to the wound in his right
hand, he could not even write. Yet, in the mean time, he showed me his
regard by the most obliging courtesies. All these unusual attentions I
combined with what my mother had disclosed to me, and constantly my head
was full of fancies. The whole city talked of the occurrence. With me
they spoke of it in a peculiar tone: they drew inferences, which,
greatly as I struggled to avoid them, touched me very close. What had
formerly been habitude and trifling, was now grown seriousness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
inclination. The anxiety in which I lived was the more violent, the more
carefully I studied to conceal it from every one. The idea of losing him
frightened me: the possibility of any closer union made me tremble. For
a half-prudent girl, there is really something awful in the thought of
marriage.</p>

<p>By such incessant agitations I was once more led to recollect myself.
The gaudy imagery of a thoughtless life, which used to hover day and
night before my eyes, was at once blown away. My soul again began to
awaken, but the greatly interrupted intimacy with my invisible friend
was not so easy to renew. We still continued at a frigid distance: it
was again something, but little to the times of old.</p>

<p>A duel had been fought, and the captain severely wounded, before I ever
heard of it. The public feeling was, in all senses, strong on the side
of my lover, who at length again appeared upon the scene. But, first of
all, he came, with his head tied up and his arm in a sling, to visit us.
How my heart beat while he was there! The whole family was present:
general thanks and compliments were all that passed on either side.
Narciss, however, found an opportunity to show some secret tokens of his
love to me; by which means my inquietude was but increased. After his
recovery he visited us throughout the winter on the former footing; and
in spite of all the soft, private marks of tenderness which he contrived
to give me, the whole affair remained unsettled, undiscussed.</p>

<p>In this manner was I kept in constant practice. I could trust my
thoughts to no mortal, and from God I was too far removed. Him I had
quite forgotten those four wild years: I now again began to think of him
occasionally, but our acquaintance had grown cool; they were visits of
mere ceremony these; and as, moreover, in waiting on him, I used to
dress in fine apparel, to set before him self-complacently my virtue,
honor, and superiorities to others, he did not seem to notice me, or
know me in that finery.</p>

<p>A courtier would have been exceedingly distressed, if the prince who
held his fortune in his hands had treated him in this way; but, for me,
I did not sorrow at it. I had what I required,&mdash;health and
conveniences: if God should please to think of me, well; if not, I
reckoned I had done my duty.</p>

<p>This, in truth, I did not think at that period; yet it was the true
figure of my soul. But, to change and purify my feelings, preparations
were already made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>The spring came on: Narciss once visited me unannounced, and at a time
when I happened to be quite alone. He now appeared in the character of
lover, and asked me if I could bestow on him my heart, and, so soon as
he should obtain some lucrative and honorable place, my hand along with
it.</p>

<p>He had been received into our service; but at first they kept him back,
and would not rapidly promote him, because they dreaded his ambition.
Having some little fortune of his own, he was left with a slender
salary.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my regard for him, I knew that he was not a man to treat
with altogether frankly. I drew up, therefore, and referred him to my
father. About my father he did not seem to doubt, but wished first to be
at one with me, now and here. I at last said, Yes; but stipulated, as an
indispensable condition, that my parents should concur. He then spoke
formally with both of them; they signified their satisfaction: mutual
promises were given, on the faith of his advancement, which it was
expected would be speedy. Sisters and aunts were informed of this
arrangement, and the strictest secrecy enjoined on them.</p>

<p>Thus had my lover become my bridegroom, and great was the difference
between the two. If one could change the lovers of all honorable maidens
into bridegrooms, it would be a kindness to our sex, even though
marriage should not follow the connection. The love between two persons
does not lessen by the change, but it becomes more reasonable.
Innumerable little follies, all coquetries and caprices, disappear. If
the bridegroom tells us that we please him better in a morning-cap than
in the finest head-dress, no discreet young woman will disturb herself
about her hair-dressing; and nothing is more natural than that he, too,
should think solidly, and rather wish to form a housewife for himself
than a gaudy doll for others. And thus it is in every province of the
business.</p>

<p>Should a young woman of this kind be fortunate enough to have a
bridegroom who possesses understanding and acquirements, she learns from
him more than universities and foreign lands can teach. She not only
willingly receives instruction when he offers it, but she endeavors to
elicit more and more from him. Love makes much that was impossible
possible. By degrees, too, that subjection, so necessary and so graceful
for the female sex, begins: the bridegroom does not govern like the
husband; he only asks: but his mistress seeks to discover what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
wants, and to offer it before he asks it.</p>

<p>So did experience teach me what I would not for much have missed. I was
happy, truly happy as woman could be in the world,&mdash;that is to say,
for a while.</p>

<p>Amid these quiet joys, a summer passed away. Narciss gave not the
slightest reason to complain of him: he daily became more dear to me; my
whole soul was his. This he well knew, and knew also how to prize it.
Meanwhile, from seeming trifles, something rose, which by and by grew
hurtful to our union.</p>

<p>Narciss behaved to me as to a bride, and never dared to ask of me such
favors as were yet forbidden us. But, about the boundaries of virtue and
decorum, we were of very different opinions. I meant to walk securely,
and so never granted him the smallest freedom which the whole world
might not have witnessed. He, used to dainties, thought this diet very
strict. On this point there was continual variance: he praised my
modesty, and sought to undermine my resolution.</p>

<p>The <i>serious</i> of my old French teacher now occurred to me, as well as
the defence which I had once suggested in regard to it.</p>

<p>With God I had again become a little more acquainted. He had given me a
bridegroom whom I loved, and for this I felt some thankfulness. Earthly
love itself concentrated my soul, and put its powers in motion: nor did
it contradict my intercourse with God. I naturally complained to him of
what alarmed me, but I did not perceive that I myself was wishing and
desiring it. In my own eyes I was strong: I did not pray, "Lead us not
into temptation!" My thoughts were far beyond temptation. In this flimsy
tinsel-work of virtue I came to God. He did not drive me back. On the
smallest movement towards him, he left a soft impression in my soul; and
this impression caused me always to return.</p>

<p>Except Narciss, the world was altogether dead to me: excepting him,
there was nothing in it that had any charm. Even my love for dress was
but the wish to please him: if I knew that he was not to see me, I could
spend no care upon it. I liked to dance; but, if he was not beside me,
it seemed as if I could not bear the motion. At a brilliant festival, if
he was not invited, I could neither take the trouble of providing new
things, nor of putting on the old according to the mode. To me they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
were alike agreeable, or rather, I might say, alike burdensome. I used
to reckon such an evening very fairly spent when I could join myself to
any ancient card-party, though formerly I had not the smallest taste for
such things; and, if some old acquaintance came and rallied me about it,
I would smile, perhaps for the first time all that night. So, likewise,
it was with promenades, and every social entertainment that can be
imagined:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">"Him had I chosen from all others;</span>
  <span class="i2">His would I be, and not another's:</span>
  <span class="i2">To me his love was all in all."</span>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Thus was I often solitary in the midst of company, and real solitude was
generally acceptable to me. But my busy soul could neither sleep nor
dream: I felt and thought, and acquired by degrees some faculty to speak
about my feelings and my thoughts with God. Then were feelings of
another sort unfolded, but these did not contradict the former feelings:
my affection to Narciss accorded with the universal scheme of nature; it
nowhere hindered the performance of a duty. They did not contradict each
other, yet they were immensely different. Narciss was the only living
form which hovered in my mind, and to which my love was all directed;
but the other feeling was not directed towards any form, and yet it was
unspeakably agreeable. I no longer have it: I no longer can impart it.</p>

<p>My lover, whom I used to trust with all my secrets, did not know of
this. I soon discovered that he thought far otherwise: he often gave me
writings which opposed, with light and heavy weapons, all that can be
called connection with the Invisible. I used to read the books because
they came from him; but, at the end, I knew no word of all that had been
argued in them.</p>

<p>Nor, in regard to sciences and knowledge, was there want of
contradiction in our conduct. He did as all men do,&mdash;he mocked at
learned women; and yet he kept continually instructing me. He used to
speak with me on all subjects, law excepted; and, while constantly
procuring books of every kind for me, he frequently repeated the
uncertain precept, "That a lady ought to keep the knowledge she might
have more secret than the Calvinist his creed in Catholic countries."
And while I, by natural consequence, endeavored not to show myself more
wise or learned than formerly before the world, Narciss himself was
commonly the first who yielded to the vanity of speaking about me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
and my superiorities.</p>

<p>A nobleman of high repute, and at that time valued for his influence,
his talents, and accomplishments, was living at our court with great
applause. He bestowed especial notice on Narciss, whom he kept
continually about him. They once had an argument about the virtue of
women. Narciss repeated to me what had passed between them: I was not
wanting with my observations, and my friend required of me a written
essay on the subject. I could write French fluently enough: I had laid a
good foundation with my teacher. My correspondence with Narciss was
likewise carried on in French: except in French books, there was then no
elegant instruction to be had. My essay pleased the count: I was obliged
to let him have some little songs, which I had lately been composing. In
short, Narciss appeared to revel without stint in the renown of his
beloved: and the story, to his great contentment, ended with a French
epistle in heroic verse, which the count transmitted to him on
departing; in which their argument was mentioned, and my friend reminded
of his happiness in being destined, after all his doubts and errors, to
learn most certainly what virtue was, in the arms of a virtuous and
charming wife.</p>

<p>He showed this poem first of all to me, and then to almost every one;
each thinking of the matter what he pleased. Thus did he act in several
cases: every stranger, whom he valued, must be made acquainted in our
house.</p>

<p>A noble family was staying for a season in the place, to profit by the
skill of our physician. In this house, too, Narciss was looked on as a
son; he introduced me there; we found among these worthy persons the
most pleasant entertainment for mind and heart. Even the common pastimes
of society appeared less empty here than elsewhere. All knew how matters
stood with us: they treated us as circumstances would allow, and left
the main relation unalluded to. I mention this one family; because, in
the after-period of my life, it had a powerful influence upon me.</p>

<p>Almost a year of our connection had elapsed; and, along with it, our
spring was over. The summer came, and all grew drier and more earnest.</p>

<p>By several unexpected deaths, some offices fell vacant, which Narciss
might make pretensions to. The instant was at hand when my whole destiny
must be decided; and while Narciss, and all our friends, were making
every effort to efface some impressions which obstructed him at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
court, and to obtain for him the wished-for situation, I turned with my
request to my Invisible Friend. I was received so kindly, that I gladly
came again. I confessed, without disguise, my wish that Narciss might
obtain the place; but my prayer was not importunate, and I did not
require that it should happen for the sake of my petition.</p>

<p>The place was obtained by a far inferior competitor. I was dreadfully
troubled at this news: I hastened to my room, the door of which I locked
behind me. The first fit of grief went off in a shower of tears: the
next thought was, "Yet it was not by chance that it happened;" and
instantly I formed the resolution to be well content with it, seeing
even this apparent evil would be for my true advantage. The softest
emotions then pressed in upon me, and divided all the clouds of sorrow.
I felt, that, with help like this, there was nothing one might not
endure. At dinner I appeared quite cheerful, to the great astonishment
of all the house.</p>

<p>Narciss had less internal force than I, and I was called upon to comfort
him. In his family, too, he had many crosses to encounter, some of which
afflicted him considerably; and, such true confidence subsisting between
us, he intrusted me with all. His negotiations for entering on foreign
service were not more fortunate; all this I felt deeply on his account
and mine; all this, too, I ultimately carried to the place where my
petitions had already been so well received.</p>

<p>The softer these experiences were, the oftener did I endeavor to renew
them: I hoped continually to meet with comfort where I had so often met
with it. Yet I did not always meet with it: I was as one that goes to
warm him in the sunshine, while there is something standing in the way
that makes a shadow. "What is this?" I asked myself. I traced the matter
zealously, and soon perceived that it all depended on the situation of
my soul: if this was not turned in the straightest direction towards
God, I still continued cold; I did not feel his counter-influence; I
could obtain no answer. The second question was, "What hinders this
direction?" Here I was in a wide field: I perplexed myself in an inquiry
which lasted nearly all the second year of my attachment to Narciss. I
might have ended the investigation sooner, for it was not long till I
had got upon the proper trace; but I would not confess it, and I sought
a thousand outlets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>I very soon discovered that the straight direction of my soul was marred
by foolish dissipations, and employment with unworthy things. The how
and the where were clear enough to me. Yet by what means could I help
myself, or extricate my mind from the calls of a world where every thing
was either cold indifference or hot insanity? Gladly would I have left
things standing as they were, and lived from day to day, floating down
with the stream, like other people whom I saw quite happy: but I durst
not: my inmost feelings contradicted me too often. Yet if I determined
to renounce society, and alter my relations to others, it was not in my
power. I was hemmed in as by a ring drawn round me; certain connections
I could not dissolve; and, in the matter which lay nearest to my heart,
fatalities accumulated and oppressed me more and more. I often went to
bed with tears, and, after a sleepless night, arose again with tears: I
required some strong support: and God would not vouchsafe it me while I
was running with the cap and bells.</p>

<p>I proceeded now to estimate my doings, all and each: dancing and play
were first put upon their trial. Never was there any thing spoken,
thought, or written, for or against these practices, which I did not
examine, talk of, read, weigh, reject, aggravate, and plague myself
about. If I gave up these habits, I was certain that Narciss would be
offended; for he dreaded exceedingly the ridicule which any look of
straitlaced conscientiousness gives one in the eyes of the world. And
doing what I now looked upon as folly, noxious folly, out of no taste of
my own, but merely to gratify him, it all grew wofully irksome to me.</p>

<p>Without disagreeable prolixities and repetitions, it is not in my power
to represent what pains I took, in trying so to counteract those
occupations which distracted my attention and disturbed my peace of
mind, that my heart, in spite of them, might still be open to the
influences of the Invisible Being. But at last, with pain, I was
compelled to admit, that in this way the quarrel could not be composed.
For no sooner had I clothed myself in the garment of folly, than it came
to be something more than a mask, than the foolishness pierced and
penetrated me through and through.</p>

<p>May I here overstep the province of a mere historical detail, and offer
one or two remarks on what was then taking place within me? What could
it be which so changed my tastes and feelings, that, in my twenty-second
year, nay, earlier, I lost all relish for the recreations with which
people of that age are harmlessly delighted? Why were they not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
harmless for me? I may answer, "Just because they were not harmless;
because I was not, like others of my years, unacquainted with my soul."
No! I knew, from experiences which had reached me unsought, that there
are loftier emotions, which afford us a contentment such as it is vain
to seek in the amusements of the world; and that, in these higher joys,
there is also kept a secret treasure for strengthening the spirit in
misfortune.</p>

<p>But the pleasures of society, the dissipations of youth, must needs have
had a powerful charm for me; since it was not in my power to engage in
them without participation, to act among them as if they were not there.
How many things could I now do, if I liked, with entire coldness, which
then dazzled and confounded me, nay, threatened to obtain the mastery
over me! Here there could no medium be observed: either those delicious
amusements, or my nourishing and quickening internal emotions, must be
given up.</p>

<p>But, in my soul, the strife had, without my own consciousness, already
been decided. Even if there still was any thing within me that longed
for earthly pleasures, I had now become unfitted for enjoying them. Much
as a man might hanker after wine, all desire of drinking would forsake
him, if he should be placed among full barrels in a cellar, where the
foul air was like to suffocate him. Free air is more than wine; this I
felt but too keenly: and, from the first, it would have cost me little
studying to prefer the good to the delightful, if the fear of losing the
affection of Narciss had not restrained me. But at last, when after many
thousand struggles, and thoughts continually renewed, I began to cast a
steady eye upon the bond which held me to him, I discovered that it was
but weak, that it might be torn asunder. I at once perceived it to be
only as a glass bell, which shut me up in the exhausted, airless space:
one bold stroke to break the bell in pieces, and thou art delivered!</p>

<p>No sooner thought than tried. I drew off the mask, and on all occasions
acted as my heart directed. Narciss I still cordially loved: but the
thermometer, which formerly had stood in hot water, was now hanging in
the natural air; it could rise no higher than the warmth of the
atmosphere directed.</p>

<p>Unhappily it cooled very much. Narciss drew back, and began to assume a
distant air: this was at his option, but my thermometer descended as he
drew back. Our family observed this, questioned me, and seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
surprised. I explained to them, with stout defiance, that heretofore I
had made abundant sacrifices; that I was ready, still farther and to the
end of my life, to share all crosses that befell him; but that I
required full freedom in my conduct, that my doings and avoidings must
depend upon my own conviction; that, indeed, I would never bigotedly
cleave to my own opinion, but, on the other hand, would willingly be
reasoned with; yet, as it concerned my own happiness, the decision must
proceed from myself, and be liable to no manner of constraint. The
greatest physician could not move me, by his reasonings, to take an
article of food, which perhaps was altogether wholesome and agreeable to
many, so soon as my experience had shown, that on all occasions it was
noxious to me; as I might produce coffee for an instance: and just as
little, nay, still less, would I have any sort of conduct which misled
me, preached up and demonstrated upon me as morally profitable.</p>

<p>Having so long prepared myself in silence, these debates were rather
pleasant than vexatious to me. I gave vent to my soul: I felt the whole
worth of my determination. I yielded not a hair's-breadth, and those to
whom I owed no filial respect were sharply handled and despatched. In
the family I soon prevailed. My mother from her youth had entertained
these sentiments, though in her they had never reached maturity; for no
necessity had pressed upon her, and exalted her courage to achieve her
purpose. She rejoiced in beholding her silent wishes fulfilled through
me. My younger sisters seemed to join themselves with me: the second was
attentive and quiet. Our aunt had the most to object. The arguments
which she employed appeared to her irrefragable; and they were
irrefragable, being altogether commonplace. At last I was obliged to
show her, that she had no voice in the affair in any sense; and, after
this, she seldom signified that she persisted in her views. She was,
indeed, the only person that observed this transaction close at hand,
without in some degree experiencing its influence. I do not calumniate
her, when I say that she had no character, and the most limited ideas.</p>

<p>My father had acted altogether in his own way. He spoke not much, but
often, with me on the matter: his arguments were rational; and, being
<i>his</i> arguments, they could not be impugned. It was only the deep
feeling of my right that gave me strength to dispute against him. But
the scenes soon changed: I was forced to make appeal to his heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
Straitened by his understanding, I came out with the most pathetic
pleadings. I gave free course to my tongue and to my tears. I showed him
how much I loved Narciss; how much constraint I had for two years been
enduring; how certain I was of being in the right; that I was ready to
testify that certainty, by the loss of my beloved bridegroom and
prospective happiness,&mdash;nay, if it were necessary, by the loss of
all that I possessed on earth; that I would rather leave my native
country, my parents, and my friends, and beg my bread in foreign lands,
than act against these dictates of my conscience. He concealed his
emotion: he said nothing on the subject for a while, and at last he
openly declared in my favor.</p>

<p>During all this time Narciss forbore to visit us; and my father now gave
up the weekly club, where he was used to meet him. The business made a
noise at court, and in the town. People talked about it, as is common in
such cases, which the public takes a vehement interest in, because its
sentence has usurped an influence on the resolutions of weak minds. I
knew enough about the world to understand that one's conduct is often
censured by the very persons who would have advised it, had one
consulted them; and independently of this, with my internal composure, I
should have looked on all such transitory speculations just as if they
had not been.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I hindered not myself from yielding to my inclination
for Narciss. To me he had become invisible, and to him my feelings had
not altered. I loved him tenderly; as it were anew, and much more
steadfastly than before. If he chose to leave my conscience undisturbed,
then I was his: wanting this condition, I would have refused a kingdom
with him. For several months I bore these feelings and these thoughts
about with me; and, finding at last that I was calm and strong enough to
go peacefully and firmly to work, I wrote him a polite but not a tender
note, inquiring why he never came to see me.</p>

<p>As I knew his manner of avoiding to explain himself in little matters,
but of silently doing what seemed good to him, I purposely urged him in
the present instance. I got a long, and, as it seemed to me, pitiful,
reply, in vague style and unmeaning phrases, stating, that, without a
better place, he could not fix himself, and offer me his hand; that I
best knew how hard it had fared with him hitherto; that as he was
afraid lest a fruitless intercourse, so long continued, might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
prove hurtful to my reputation, I would give him leave to continue at
his present distance; so soon as it was in his power to make me happy,
he would look upon the word which he had given me as sacred.</p>

<p>I answered him on the spot, that, as our intercourse was known to all
the world, it might, perhaps, be rather late to spare my reputation:
for which, at any rate, my conscience and my innocence were the surest
pledges; however, that I hereby freely gave him back his word, and hoped
the change would prove a happy one for him. The same hour I received
a short reply, which was, in all essential particulars, entirely
synonymous with the first. He adhered to his former statement, that, so
soon as he obtained a situation, he would ask me, if I pleased, to share
his fortune with him.</p>

<p>This I interpreted as meaning simply nothing. I signified to my
relations and acquaintances, that the affair was altogether settled; and
it was so in fact. Having, nine months afterwards, obtained the
much-desired preferment, he offered me his hand, but under the
condition, that, as the wife of a man who must keep house like other
people, I should alter my opinions. I returned him many thanks, and
hastened with my heart and mind away from this transaction, as one
hastens from the playhouse when the curtain falls. And as he, a short
time afterwards, had found a rich and advantageous match, a thing now
easy for him; and as I now knew him to be happy in the way he
liked,&mdash;my own tranquillity was quite complete.</p>

<p>I must not pass in silence the fact, that several times before he got a
place, and after it, there were respectable proposals made to me; which,
however, I declined without the smallest hesitation, much as my father
and my mother could have wished for more compliance on my part.</p>

<p>At length, after a stormy March and April, the loveliest May weather
seemed to be allotted me. With good health, I enjoyed an indescribable
composure of mind: look around me as I pleased, my loss appeared a gain
to me. Young and full of sensibility, I thought the universe a thousand
times more beautiful than formerly, when I required to have society and
play, that in the fair garden tedium might not overtake me. And now, as
I did not conceal my piety, I likewise took heart to own my love for the
sciences and arts. I drew, painted, read, and found enough of people to
support me: instead of the great world, which I had left, or, rather,
which had left me, a smaller one formed itself about me, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
infinitely richer and more entertaining. I had a turn for social life;
and I do not deny, that, on giving up my old acquaintances, I trembled
at the thought of solitude. I now found myself abundantly, perhaps
excessively, indemnified. My acquaintances erelong were very numerous,
not at home only, but likewise among people at a distance. My story had
been noised abroad, and many persons felt a curiosity to see the woman
who had valued God above her bridegroom. There was a certain pious tone
to be observed, at that time, generally over Germany. In the families of
several counts and princes, a care for the welfare of the soul had been
awakened. Nor were there wanting noblemen who showed a like attention;
while, in the inferior classes, sentiments of this kind were diffused on
every side.</p>

<p>The noble family, whom I mentioned above, now drew me nearer to them.
They had, in the mean while, gathered strength; several of their
relations having settled in the town. These estimable persons courted my
familiarity, as I did theirs. They had high connections: I became
acquainted, in their house, with a great part of the princes, counts,
and lords of the empire. My sentiments were not concealed from any one:
they might be honored or be tolerated; I obtained my object,&mdash;none
attacked me.</p>

<p>There was yet another way by which I was again led back into the world.
About this period a step-brother of my father, who till now had never
visited the house except in passing, staid with us for a considerable
time. He had left the service of his court, where he enjoyed great
influence and honor, simply because all matters were not managed quite
according to his mind. His intellect was just, his character was rigid.
In these points he was very like my father: only the latter had withal a
certain touch of softness, which enabled him with greater ease to yield
a little in affairs, and though not to do, yet to permit, some things
against his own conviction; and then to evaporate his anger at them,
either in silence by himself, or in confidence amid his family. My uncle
was a great deal younger, and his independence of spirit had been
favored by his outward circumstances. His mother had been very rich, and
he still had large possessions to expect from her near and distant
relatives; so he needed no foreign increase: whereas my father, with his
moderate fortune, was bound to his place by the consideration of his
salary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>My uncle had become still more unbending from domestic sufferings. He
had early lost an amiable wife and a hopeful son; and, from that time,
he appeared to wish to push away from him every thing that did not hang
upon his individual will.</p>

<p>In our family it was whispered now and then with some complacency, that
probably he would not wed again, and so we children might anticipate
inheriting his fortune. I paid small regard to this, but the demeanor of
the rest was not a little modified by their hopes. In his own
imperturbable firmness of character, my uncle had grown into the habit
of never contradicting any one in conversation. On the other hand, he
listened with a friendly air to every one's opinion, and would himself
elucidate and strengthen it by instances and reasons of his own. All who
did not know him fancied that he thought as they did: for he was
possessed of a preponderating intellect, and could transport himself
into the mental state of any man, and imitate his manner of conceiving.
With me he did not prosper quite so well; for here the question was
about emotions, of which he had not any glimpse: and, with whatever
tolerance and sympathy and rationality he spoke about my sentiments, it
was palpable to me, that he had not the slightest notion of what formed
the ground of all my conduct.</p>

<p>With all his secrecy, we by and by found out the aim of his unusual stay
with us. He had, as we at length discovered, cast his eyes upon our
youngest sister, with the view of giving her in marriage, and rendering
her happy as he pleased; and certainly, considering her personal and
mental attractions, particularly when a handsome fortune was laid into
the scale along with them, she might pretend to the first matches. His
feelings towards me he likewise showed us pantomimically, by procuring
me a post of canoness, the income of which I very soon began to draw.</p>

<p>My sister was not so contented with his care as I. She now disclosed to
me a tender secret, which hitherto she had very wisely kept back;
fearing, as in truth it happened, that I would by all means counsel her
against connection with a man who was not suited to her. I did my
utmost, and succeeded. The purpose of my uncle was too serious and too
distinct: the prospect for my sister, with her worldly views, was too
delightful to be thwarted by a passion which her own understanding
disapproved; she mustered force to give it up.</p>

<p>On her ceasing to resist the gentle guidance of my uncle, the
foundation of his plan was quickly laid. She was appointed maid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
honor at a neighboring court, where he could commit her to the oversight
and the instructions of a lady, his friend, who presided there as
governess with great applause. I accompanied her to the place of her new
abode. Both of us had reason to be satisfied with the reception we met
with; and frequently I could not help, in secret, smiling at the
character, which now as canoness, as young and pious canoness, I was
enacting in the world.</p>

<p>In earlier times a situation such as this would have confused me
dreadfully, perhaps have turned my head; but now, in the midst of all
the splendors that surrounded me, I felt extremely cool. With great
quietness I let them frizzle me, and deck me out for hours, and thought
no more of it than that my place required me to wear that gala livery.
In the thronged saloons I spoke with all and each, though no shape or
character among them made any impression on me. On returning to my
house, nearly all the feeling I brought back with me was that of tired
limbs. Yet my understanding drew advantage from the multitude of persons
whom I saw: and I became acquainted with some ladies, patterns of every
virtue, of a noble and good demeanor; particularly with the governess,
under whom my sister was to have the happiness of being formed.</p>

<p>At my return, however, the consequences of this journey, in regard to
health, were found to be less favorable. With the greatest temperance,
the strictest diet, I had not been, as I used to be, completely mistress
of my time and strength. Food, motion, rising, and going to sleep,
dressing and visiting, had not depended, as at home, on my own
conveniency and will. In the circle of social life you cannot stop
without a breach of courtesy: all that was needful I had willingly
performed; because I looked upon it as my duty, because I knew that it
would soon be over, and because I felt myself completely healthy. Yet
this unusual, restless life must have had more effect upon me than I was
aware of. Scarcely had I reached home, and cheered my parents with a
comfortable narrative, when I was attacked by a hemorrhage, which,
although it did not prove dangerous or lasting, yet left a weakness
after it, perceptible for many a day.</p>

<p>Here, then, I had another lesson to repeat. I did it joyfully. Nothing
bound me to the world, and I was convinced that here the true good was
never to be found; so I waited in the cheerfullest and meekest state:
and, after having abdicated life, I was retained in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>A new trial was awaiting me: my mother took a painful and oppressive
ailment, which she had to bear five years, before she paid the debt of
nature. All this time we were sharply proved. Often, when her terror
grew too strong, she would have us all summoned, in the night, to her
bed, that so at least she might be busied, if not bettered, by our
presence. The load grew heavier, nay, scarcely to be borne, when my
father, too, became unwell. From his youth he had frequently had violent
headaches, which, however, at longest never used to last beyond six and
thirty hours. But now they were continual; and, when they mounted to a
high degree of pain, his moanings tore my very heart. It was in these
tempestuous seasons that I chiefly felt my bodily weakness; because it
kept me from my holiest and dearest duties, or rendered the performance
of them hard to an extreme degree.</p>

<p>It was now that I could try whether the path which I had chosen was the
path of fantasy or truth; whether I had merely thought as others showed
me, or the object of my trust had a reality. To my unspeakable support,
I always found the latter. The straight direction of my heart to God, the
fellowship of the "Beloved Ones."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I had sought and found; and this
was what made all things light to me. As a traveller in the dark, my
soul, when all was pressing on me from without, hastened to the place of
refuge; and never did it return empty.</p>

<p>In later times some champions of religion, who seem to be animated more
by zeal than feeling for it, have required of their brethren to produce
examples of prayers actually heard; apparently as wishing to have seal
and signature, that so they might proceed juridically in the matter. How
unknown must the true feeling be to these persons! how few real
experiences can they themselves have made!</p>

<p>I can say that I never returned empty, when in straits and oppression
I called on God. This is saying infinitely much: more I must not and
can not say. Important as each experience was at the critical moment
for myself, the recital of them would be flat, improbable, and
insignificant, were I to specify the separate cases. Happy was I, that
a thousand little incidents in combination proved, as clearly as the
drawing of my breath proved me to be living, that I was not without God
in the world. He was near to me: I was before him. This is what, with a
diligent avoidance of all theological systematic terms, I can with the
greatest truth declare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>Much do I wish, that, in those times too, I had been entirely without
system. But which of us arrives early at the happiness of being
conscious of his individual self, in its own pure combination, without
extraneous forms? I was in earnest with religion. I timidly trusted in
the judgments of others: I entirely gave in to the Hallean system of
conversion, but my nature would by no means tally with it.</p>

<p>According to this scheme of doctrine, the alteration of the heart must
begin with a deep terror on account of sin: the heart in this agony must
recognize, in a less or greater degree, the punishment which it has
merited, must get a foretaste of hell, and so embitter the delight of
sin. At last it feels a very palpable assurance of grace; which,
however, in its progress often fades away, and must again be sought with
earnest prayer.</p>

<p>Of all this no jot or tittle happened with me. When I sought God
sincerely, he let himself be found of me, and did not reproach me about
by-gone things. On looking back, I saw well enough where I had been
unworthy, where I still was so; but the confession of my faults was
altogether without terror. Not for a moment did the fear of hell occur
to me; nay, the very notion of a wicked spirit, and a place of
punishment and torment after death, could nowise gain admission into the
circle of my thoughts. I considered the men who lived without God, whose
hearts were shut against the trust in and the love of the Invisible, as
already so unhappy, that a hell and external pains appeared to promise
rather an alleviation than an increase of their misery. I had but to
look upon the persons, in this world, who in their breasts gave scope to
hateful feelings; who hardened their hearts against the good of whatever
kind, and strove to force the evil on themselves and others; who shut
their eyes by day, that so they might deny the shining of the sun. How
unutterably wretched did these persons seem to me! Who could have formed
a hell to make their situation worse?</p>

<p>This mood of mind continued in me, without change, for half a score of
years. It maintained itself through many trials, even at the moving
death-bed of my beloved mother. I was frank enough, on this occasion,
not to hide my comfortable frame of mind from certain pious but
rigorously orthodox people; and I had to suffer many a friendly
admonition on that score. They reckoned they were just in season,
for explaining with what earnestness one should be diligent to lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
a right foundation in the days of health and youth.</p>

<p>In earnestness I, too, determined not to fail. For the moment I
allowed myself to be convinced; and fain would I have grown, for life,
distressed and full of fears. But what was my surprise on finding that
I absolutely could not. When I thought of God, I was cheerful and
contented: even at the painful end of my dear mother, I did not shudder
at the thought of death. Yet I learned many and far other things than my
uncalled teachers thought of, in these solemn hours.</p>

<p>By degrees I grew to doubt the dictates of so many famous people, and
retained my own sentiments in silence. A certain lady of my friends, to
whom I had at first disclosed too much, insisted always on interfering
with my business. Of her, too, I was obliged to rid myself: I at last
firmly told her, that she might spare herself this labor, as I did not
need her counsel; that I knew my God, and would have no guide but him.
She was greatly offended: I believe she never quite forgave me.</p>

<p>Such determination to withdraw from the advices and the influence of my
friends, in spiritual matters, produced the consequence, that also in my
temporal affairs I gained sufficient courage to obey my own persuasions.
But for the assistance of my faithful, invisible Leader, I could not
have prospered here. I am still gratefully astonished at his wise and
happy guidance. No one knew how matters stood with me: even I myself did
not know.</p>

<p>The thing, the wicked and inexplicable thing, which separates us from
the Being to whom we owe our life, and in whom all that deserves the
name of life must find its nourishment,&mdash;the thing which we call
sin I yet knew nothing of.</p>

<p>In my intercourse with my invisible Friend, I felt the sweetest
enjoyment of all my powers. My desire of constantly enjoying this
felicity was so predominant, that I abandoned without hesitation
whatever marred our intercourse; and here experience was my best
teacher. But it was with me as with sick persons who have no medicine,
and try to help themselves by diet: something is accomplished, but far
from enough.</p>

<p>I could not always live in solitude, though in it I found the best
preservative against the dissipation of my thoughts. On returning to the
tumult, the impression it produced upon me was the deeper for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
previous loneliness. My most peculiar advantage lay in this, that love
for quiet was my ruling passion, and that in the end I still drew back
to it. I perceived, as in a kind of twilight, my weakness and my misery,
and tried to save myself by avoiding danger and exposure.</p>

<p>For seven years I had used my dietetic scheme. I held myself not wicked,
and I thought my state desirable. But for some peculiar circumstances
and occurrences I had remained in this position: it was by a curious
path that I got farther. Contrary to the advice of all my friends, I
entered on a new connection. Their objections, at first, made me pause.
I turned to my invisible Leader; and, as he permitted me, I went forward
without fear.</p>

<p>A man of spirit, heart, and talents had bought a property beside us.
Among the strangers whom I grew acquainted with, were this person and
his family. In our manners, domestic economy, and habits we accorded
well; and thus we soon approximated to each other.</p>

<p>Philo, as I propose to call him, was already middle-aged: in certain
matters he was highly serviceable to my father, whose strength was now
decaying. He soon became the friend of the family: and finding in me, as
he was pleased to say, a person free alike from the extravagance and
emptiness of the great world, and from the narrowness and aridness of
the still world in the country, he courted intimacy with me; and erelong
we were in one another's confidence. To me he was very pleasing and
useful.</p>

<p>Though I did not feel the smallest inclination or capacity for mingling
in public business, or seeking any influence on it, yet I liked to hear
about such matters,&mdash;liked to know whatever happened far and near.
Of worldly things, I loved to get a clear though unconcerned perception:
feeling, sympathy, affection, I reserved for God, for my people, and my
friends.</p>

<p>The latter were, if I may say so, jealous of Philo, in my new connection
with him. In more than one sense, they were right in warning me about
it. I suffered much in secret, for even I could not consider their
remonstrances as altogether empty or selfish. I had been accustomed,
from of old, to give a reason for my views and conduct; but in this case
my conviction would not follow. I prayed to God, that here, as
elsewhere, he would warn, restrain, and guide me; and, as my heart on
this did not dissuade me, I went forward on my way with comfort.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>Philo, on the whole, had a remote resemblance to Narciss: only a pious
education had more enlivened and concentrated his feelings. He had less
vanity, more character; and in business, if Narciss was delicate, exact,
persevering, indefatigable, the other was clear, sharp, quick, and
capable of working with incredible ease. By means of him I learned the
secret history of almost every noble personage with whose exterior I had
got acquainted in society. It was pleasant for me to behold the tumult,
off my watch-tower from afar. Philo could now hide nothing from me: he
confided to me, by degrees, his own concerns, both inward and outward. I
was in fear because of him, for I foresaw certain circumstances and
entanglements; and the mischief came more speedily than I had looked
for. There were some confessions he had still kept back, and even at
last he told me only what enabled me to guess the worst.</p>

<p>What an effect had this upon my heart! I attained experiences which to
me were altogether new. With infinite sorrow I beheld an Agathon, who,
educated in the groves of Delphi, still owed his school-fees, which he
was now obliged to pay with their accumulated interest; and this Agathon
was my especial friend. My sympathy was lively and complete; I suffered
with him; both of us were in the strangest state.</p>

<p>After having long occupied myself with the temper of his mind, I at last
turned round to contemplate my own. The thought, "Thou art no better
than he," rose like a little cloud before me, and gradually expanded
till it darkened all my soul.</p>

<p>I now not only thought myself no better than he: I felt this, and felt
it as I should not wish to do again. Nor was it any transitory mood. For
more than a year, I was compelled to feel, that, had not an unseen hand
restrained me, I might have become a Girard, a Cartouche, a Damiens, or
any wretch you can imagine. The tendencies to this I traced too clearly
in my heart. Heavens, what a discovery!</p>

<p>If hitherto I had never been able, in the faintest degree, to
recognize in myself the reality of sin by experience, its possibility
was now become apparent to me by anticipation, in the frightfullest
manner. And yet I knew not evil; I but feared it: I felt that I might be
guilty, and could not accuse myself of being so.</p>

<p>Deeply as I was convinced that such a temperament of soul, as I now saw
mine to be, could never be adapted for that union with the invisible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
Being which I hoped for after death, I did not, in the smallest, fear
that I should finally be separated from him. With all the wickedness
which I discovered in my heart, I still loved <i>Him</i>: I hated what I
felt, nay, wished to hate it still more earnestly; my whole desire was,
to be delivered from this sickness, and this tendency to sickness; and I
was persuaded that the great Physician would at length vouchsafe his
help.</p>

<p>The sole question was, What medicine will cure this malady? The
practice of virtue? This I could not for a moment think. For ten years I
had already practised more than mere virtue; and the horrors now first
discovered had, all the while, lain hidden at the bottom of my soul.
Might they not have broken out with me, as they did with David when he
looked on Bathsheba? Yet was not he a friend of God! and was not I
assured, in my inmost heart, that God was my friend?</p>

<p>Was it, then, an unavoidable infirmity of human nature? Must we just
content ourselves in feeling and acknowledging the sovereignty of
inclination? And, with the best will, is there nothing left for us but
to abhor the fault we have committed, and on the like occasion to commit
it again?</p>

<p>From systems of morality I could obtain no comfort. Neither their
severity, by which they try to bend our inclinations, nor their
attractiveness, by which they try to place our inclinations on the side
of virtue, gave me any satisfaction. The fundamental notions, which I
had imbibed from intercourse with my invisible Friend, were of far
higher value to me.</p>

<p>Once, while I was studying the songs composed by David after that
tremendous fall, it struck me very much that he traced his indwelling
corruption even in the substance out of which he had been shaped; yet
that he wished to be freed from sin, and that he earnestly entreated for
a pure heart.</p>

<p>But how was this to be attained? The answer from Scripture I was well
aware of: "that the blood of Jesus cleanseth us from all sin," was a
Bible truth which I had long known. But now, for the first time, I
observed that as yet I had never understood this oft-repeated saying.
The questions, What does it mean? How is it to be? were day and night
working out their answers in me. At last I thought I saw, as by a gleam
of light, that what I sought was to be found in the incarnation of the
everlasting Word, by whom all things, even we ourselves, were made. That
the Eternal descended as an inhabitant to the depths in which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
dwell, which he surveys and comprehends; that he passed through our lot
from stage to stage, from conception and birth to the grave; that by
this marvellous circuit he again mounted to those shining heights,
whither we too must rise in order to be happy: all this was revealed to
me, as in a dawning remoteness.</p>

<p>Oh! why must we, in speaking of such things, make use of figures which
can only indicate external situations? Where is there in his eyes aught
high or deep, aught dark or clear? It is we only that have an Under and
Upper, a night and day. And even for this did he become like us, since
otherwise we could have had no part in him.</p>

<p>But how shall we obtain a share in this priceless benefit? "By faith,"
the Scripture says. And what is faith? To consider the account of an
event as true, what help can this afford me? I must be enabled to
appropriate its effects, its consequences. This appropriating faith must
be a state of mind peculiar, and, to the natural man, unknown.</p>

<p>"Now, gracious Father, grant me faith!" so prayed I once, in the deepest
heaviness of heart. I was leaning on a little table, where I sat: my
tear-stained countenance was hidden in my hands. I was now in the
condition in which we seldom are, but in which we are required to be, if
God is to regard our prayers.</p>

<p>Oh, that I could but paint what I felt then! A sudden force drew my soul
to the cross where Jesus once expired: it was a sudden force, a pull, I
cannot name it otherwise, such as leads our soul to an absent loved one;
an approximation, which, perhaps, is far more real and true than we
imagine. So did my soul approach the Son of man, who died upon the
cross; and that instant did I know what faith was.</p>

<p>"This is faith!" said I, and started up as if half frightened. I now
endeavored to get certain of my feeling, of my view; and shortly I
became convinced that my soul had acquired a power of soaring upwards
which was altogether new to it.</p>

<p>Words fail us in describing such emotions. I could most distinctly
separate them from all fantasy: they were entirely without fantasy,
without image; yet they gave us just such certainty of their referring
to some object as our imagination gives us when it paints the features
of an absent lover.</p>

<p>When the first rapture was over, I observed that my present condition
of mind had formerly been known to me; only I had never felt it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
such strength; I had never held it fast, never made it mine. I believe,
indeed, every human soul at intervals feels something of it. Doubtless
it is this which teaches every mortal that there is a God.</p>

<p>With such faculty, wont from of old to visit me now and then, I had
hitherto been well content: and had not, by a singular arrangement of
events, that unexpected sorrow weighed upon me for a twelvemonth; had
not my own ability and strength, on that occasion, altogether lost
credit with me,&mdash;I perhaps might have remained content with such a
state of matters all my days.</p>

<p>But now, since that great moment, I had, as it were, got wings. I could
mount aloft above what used to threaten me; as the bird can fly singing
and with ease across the fiercest stream, while the little dog stands
anxiously baying on the bank.</p>

<p>My joy was indescribable; and, though I did not mention it to any one,
my people soon observed an unaccustomed cheerfulness in me, and could
not understand the reason of my joy. Had I but forever held my peace,
and tried to nourish this serene temper in my soul; had I not allowed
myself to be misled by circumstances, so as to reveal my secret,&mdash;I
might then have been saved once more a long and tedious circuit.</p>

<p>As in the previous ten years of my Christian course, this necessary
force had not existed in my soul, I had just been in the case of other
worthy people,&mdash;had helped myself by keeping my fancy always full
of images, which had some reference to God,&mdash;a practice so far
truly useful; for noxious images and their baneful consequences are by
that means kept away. Often, too, our spirit seizes one or other of
these spiritual images, and mounts with it a little way upwards, like a
young bird fluttering from twig to twig.</p>

<p>Images and impressions pointing towards God are presented to us by the
institutions of the Church, by organs, bells, singing, and particularly
by the preaching of our pastors. Of these I used to be unspeakably
desirous; no weather, no bodily weakness, could keep me from church; the
sound of the Sunday bells was the only thing that rendered me impatient
on a sick-bed. Our head court-chaplain, a gifted man, I heard with great
pleasure; his colleagues, too, I liked: and I could pick the golden
apple of the Word from the common fruit, with which on earthen platters
it was mingled. With public ordinances, all sorts of private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
exercises were combined; and these, too, only nourished fancy and a
finer kind of sense. I was so accustomed to this track, I reverenced it
so much, that even now no higher one occurred to me. For my soul has
only feelers, and not eyes: it gropes, but does not see. Ah! that it
could get eyes, and look!</p>

<p>Now again, therefore, I went with a longing mind to sermon; but, alas!
what happened? I no longer found what I was wont to find. These
preachers were blunting their teeth on the shell, while I enjoyed the
kernel. I soon grew weary of them; and I had already been so spoiled,
that I could not be content with the little they afforded me. I required
images, I wanted impressions from without, and reckoned it a pure
spiritual desire that I felt.</p>

<p>Philo's parents had been in connection with the Herrnhuter Community: in
his library were many writings of Count Zinzendorf's. He had spoken with
me, more than once, very candidly and clearly on the subject; inviting
me to turn over one or two of these treatises, if it were but for the
sake of studying a psychological phenomenon. I looked upon the count,
and those that followed him, as very heterodox; and so the Ebersdorf
Hymn-book, which my friend had pressed upon me, lay unread.</p>

<p>However, in this total destitution of external excitements for my soul,
I opened the hymn-book, as it were, by chance, and found in it, to my
astonishment, some songs which actually, though under a fantastic form,
appeared to shadow what I felt. The originality and simplicity of their
expression drew me on. It seemed to be peculiar emotions expressed in a
peculiar way: no school technology suggested any notion of formality or
commonplace. I was persuaded that these people felt as I did: I was very
happy to lay hold of here and there a stanza in their songs, to fix it
in my memory, and carry it about with me for days.</p>

<p>Since the moment when the truth had been revealed to me, some three
months had in this way passed on. At last I came to the resolution of
disclosing every thing to Philo, and asking him to let me have those
writings, about which I had now become immoderately curious. Accordingly
I did so, notwithstanding there was something in my heart which
earnestly dissuaded me.</p>

<p>I circumstantially related to him all the story; and as he was himself a
leading person in it, and my narrative conveyed the sharpest reprimand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
on him, he felt surprised and moved to an extreme degree. He melted into
tears. I rejoiced; believing that, in his mind also, a full and
fundamental change had taken place.</p>

<p>He provided me with all the writings I could require, and now I had
excess of nourishment for my imagination. I made rapid progress in the
Zinzendorfic mode of thought and speech. And be it not supposed that I
am yet incapable of prizing the peculiar turn and manner of the count. I
willingly do him justice: he is no empty fantast; he speaks of mighty
truths, and mostly in a bold, figurative style; the people who despise
him know not either how to value or discriminate his qualities.</p>

<p>At that time I became exceedingly attached to him. Had I been mistress
of myself, I would certainly have left my friends and country, and gone
to join him. We should infallibly have understood each other, and should
hardly have agreed together long.</p>

<p>Thanks to my better genius, that now kept me so confined by my domestic
duties! I reckoned it a distant journey if I visited the garden. The
charge of my aged, weakly father afforded me employment enough; and in
hours of recreation, I had Fancy to procure me pastime. The only mortal
whom I saw was Philo; he was highly valued by my father; but, with me,
his intimacy had been cooled a little by the late explanation. Its
influence on him had not penetrated deep: and, as some attempts to talk
in my dialect had not succeeded with him, he avoided touching on this
subject; and the rather, as his extensive knowledge put it always in his
power to introduce new topics in his conversation.</p>

<p>I was thus a Herrnhut sister on my own footing. I had especially to
hide this new turn of my temper and my inclinations from the head
court-chaplain, whom, as my father confessor, I had much cause to honor,
and whose high merits his extreme aversion to the Herrnhut Community did
not diminish, in my eyes, even then. Unhappily this worthy person had to
suffer many troubles on account of me and others.</p>

<p>Several years ago he had become acquainted with an upright, pious
gentleman, residing in a distant quarter, and had long continued in
unbroken correspondence with him, as with one who truly sought God. How
painful was it to the spiritual leader, when this gentleman subsequently
joined himself to the Community of Herrnhut, where he lived for a long
while! How delightful, on the other hand, when at length he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
quarrelled with the brethren, determined to settle in our neighborhood,
and seemed once more to yield himself completely to the guidance of his
ancient friend!</p>

<p>The stranger was presented, as in triumph, by the upper pastor, to all
the chosen lambs of his fold. To our house alone he was not introduced,
because my father did not now see company. The gentleman obtained no
little approbation: he combined the polish of the court with the winning
manner of the brethren; and, having also many fine qualities by nature,
he soon became the favorite saint with all who knew him,&mdash;a result
at which the chaplain was exceedingly contented. But, alas! it was
merely in externals that the gentleman had split with the Community: in
his heart he was yet entirely a Herrnhuter. He was, in truth, concerned
for the reality of the matter; but yet the gimcracks, which the count
had stuck round it, were, at the same time, quite adapted to his taste.
Besides, he had now become accustomed to this mode of speaking and
conceiving: and, if he had to hide it carefully from his old friend, the
gladder was he, in any knot of trusty persons, to come forth with his
couplets, litanies, and little figures; in which, as might have been
supposed, he met with great applause.</p>

<p>I knew nothing of the whole affair, and wandered quietly along in my
separate path. For a good while we continued mutually unknown.</p>

<p>Once, in a leisure hour, I happened to visit a lady who was sick. I
found several acquaintances with her, and soon perceived that my
appearance had cut short their conversation. I affected not to notice
any thing, but saw erelong, with great surprise, some Herrnhut figures
stuck upon the wall in elegant frames. Quickly comprehending what had
passed before my entrance, I expressed my pleasure at the sight, in a
few suitable verses.</p>

<p>Conceive the wonder of my friends! We explained ourselves: instantly we
were agreed, and in each other's confidence.</p>

<p>I often henceforth sought opportunities of going out. Unhappily I
found such only once in the three or four weeks; yet I grew acquainted
with our gentleman apostle, and by degrees with all the body. I visited
their meetings when I could: with my social disposition, it was quite
delightful for me to communicate to others, and to hear from them, the
feelings which, till now, I had conceived and harbored by myself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>But I was not so completely taken with my friends, as not to see that
few of them could really feel the sense of those affecting words and
emblems; and that from these they drew as little benefit as formerly
they did from the symbolic language of the Church. Yet, notwithstanding,
I went on with them, not letting this disturb me. I thought I was
not called to search and try the hearts of others. Had not I, too,
by long-continued innocent exercisings of that sort, been prepared
for something better? I had my share of profit from our meetings: in
speaking, I insisted on attending to the sense and spirit, which, in
things so delicate, is rather apt to be disguised by words than
indicated by them; and for the rest, I left, with silent tolerance,
each to act according to his own conviction.</p>

<p>These quiet times of secret social joy were shortly followed by storms
of open bickering and contradiction,&mdash;contentions which excited
great commotion, I might almost say occasioned not a little scandal, in
court and town. The period was now arrived when our chaplain, that stout
gain-sayer of the Herrnhut Brethren, must discover to his deep, but, I
trust, sanctified humiliation, that his best and once most zealous
hearers were now all leaning to the side of that community. He was
excessively provoked: in the first moments he forgot all moderation, and
could not, even if he had inclined it, retract afterwards. Violent
debates took place, in which happily I was not mentioned, both as being
an accidental member of those hated meetings, and then because, in
respect of certain civic matters, our zealous preacher could not safely
disoblige either my father or my friend. With silent satisfaction I
continued neutral. It was irksome to me to converse about such feelings
and objects, even with well-affected people, when they could not
penetrate the deepest sense, and lingered merely on the surface. But to
strive with adversaries, about things on which even friends could
scarcely understand each other, seemed to me unprofitable, nay,
pernicious. For I soon perceived, that many amiable noblemen, who on
this occurrence could not shut their hearts to enmity and hatred, had
rapidly passed over to injustice, and, in order to defend an outward
form, had almost sacrificed their most substantial duties.</p>

<p>Far as the worthy clergyman might, in the present case, be wrong; much
as others tried to irritate me at him,&mdash;I could never hesitate to
give him my sincere respect. I knew him well: I could candidly transport
myself into his way of looking at these matters. I have never seen a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
man without his weaknesses: only in distinguished men they strike us
more. We wish, and will at all rates have it, that persons privileged as
they are should at the same time pay no tribute, no tax whatever. I
honored him as a superior man, and hoped to use the influence of my calm
neutrality to bring about, if not a peace, at least a truce. I know
not what my efforts might have done; but God concluded the affair more
briefly, and took the chaplain to himself. On his coffin all wept, who
had lately been striving with him about words. His uprightness, his fear
of God, no one had ever doubted.</p>

<p>I, too, was erelong forced to lay aside this Herrnhut doll-work,
which, by means of these contentions, now appeared before me in a rather
different light. Our uncle had, in silence, executed his intentions
with my sister. He offered her a young man of rank and fortune as a
bridegroom, and showed, by a rich dowry, what might be expected
of himself. My father joyfully consented: my sister was free and
forewarned; she did not hesitate to change her state. The bridal was
appointed at my uncle's castle: family and friends were all invited,
and we came together in the cheerfullest mood.</p>

<p>For the first time in my life, the aspect of a house excited admiration
in me. I had often heard of my uncle's taste, of his Italian architect,
of his collections and his library; but, comparing this with what I had
already seen, I had formed a very vague and fluctuating picture of it in
my thoughts. Great, accordingly, was my surprise at the earnest and
harmonious impression which I felt on entering the house, and which
every hall and chamber deepened. If elsewhere pomp and decoration had
but dissipated my attention, I felt here concentrated and drawn back
upon myself. In like manner the preparatives for these solemnities and
festivals produced a silent pleasure, by their air of dignity and
splendor; and to me it seemed as inconceivable that one man could have
invented and arranged all this, as that more than one could have worked
together in so high a spirit. Yet, withal, the landlord and his people
were entirely natural: not a trace of stiffness or of empty form was to
be seen.</p>

<p>The wedding itself was managed in a striking way: an exquisite strain of
vocal music came upon us by surprise, and the clergyman went through the
ceremony with a singular solemnity. I was standing by Philo at the time;
and, instead of a congratulation, he whispered in my ear, "When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
saw your sister give away her hand, I felt as if a stream of boiling
water had been poured over me."&mdash;"Why so?" I inquired. "It is
always the way with me," said he, "when I see two people joined." I
laughed at him, but I have often since had cause to recollect his words.</p>

<p>The revel of the party, among whom were many young people, looked
particularly glittering and airy; as every thing around us was dignified
and serious. The furniture, plate, table-ware, and table-ornaments
accorded with the general whole; and if in other houses you would say
the architect was of the school of the confectioner, it here appeared as
if even our confectioner and butler had taken lessons from the
architect.</p>

<p>We staid together several days, and our intelligent and gifted landlord
had variedly provided for the entertainment of his guests. I did not in
the present case repeat the melancholy proof, which has so often in my
life been forced upon me, how unhappily a large mixed company are
situated, when, altogether left to themselves, they have to select the
most general and vapid pastimes, that the fools of the party may not
want amusement, however it may fare with those that are not such.</p>

<p>My uncle had arranged it altogether differently. Two or three marshals,
if I may call them so, had been appointed by him: one of them had charge
of providing entertainment for the young. Dances, excursions, little
games, were of his invention and under his direction: and as young
people take delight in being out-of-doors, and do not fear the
influences of the air, the garden and garden-hall had been assigned to
them; while some additional pavilions and galleries had been erected and
appended to the latter, formed of boards and canvas merely, but in such
proportions, so elegant and noble, they reminded one of nothing but
stone and marble.</p>

<p>How rare is a festivity in which the person who invites the guests feels
also that it is his duty to provide for their conveniences and wants of
every kind!</p>

<p>Hunting and card parties, short promenades, opportunities for trustful
private conversations, were afforded the elder persons; and whoever
wished to go earliest to bed was sure to be lodged the farthest from
noise.</p>

<p>By this happy order, the space we lived in appeared to be a little
world: and yet, considered narrowly, the castle was not large; without
an accurate knowledge of it, and without the spirit of its owner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
it would have been impossible to entertain so many people here, and
quarter each according to his humor.</p>

<p>As the aspect of a well-formed person pleases us, so also does a fair
establishment, by means of which the presence of a rational, intelligent
mind is manifested. We feel a joy in entering even a cleanly house,
though it may be tasteless in its structure and its decorations, because
it shows us the presence of a person cultivated in at least one sense.
Doubly pleasing is it, therefore, when, from a human dwelling, the
spirit of a higher though merely sensual culture speaks to us.</p>

<p>All this was vividly impressed on my observation at my uncle's castle.
I had heard and read much of art; Philo, too, was a lover of pictures,
and had a fine collection: I myself had often practised drawing; but I
had been too deeply occupied with my emotions, striving exclusively
after the one thing needful, which alone I was bent on carrying to
perfection; and then, such objects of art as I had hitherto seen,
appeared, like all other worldly objects, to distract my thoughts. But
now, for the first time, outward things had led me back upon myself: I
now first perceived the difference between the natural charm of the
nightingale's song, and that of a four-voiced anthem pealed from the
expressive organs of men.</p>

<p>My joy over this discovery I did not hide from my uncle, who, when all
the rest were settled at their posts, was wont to come and talk with me
in private. He spoke with great modesty of what he possessed and had
produced here, with great decision of the views in which it had been
gathered and arranged: and I could easily observe that he spoke with a
forbearance towards me; seeming, in his usual way, to rate the
excellence, which he himself possessed below that other excellence,
which, in my way of thinking, was the best and properest.</p>

<p>"If we can conceive it possible," he once observed, "that the Creator of
the world himself assumed the form of his creature, and lived in that
manner for a time upon earth, this creature must appear to us of
infinite perfection, because susceptible of such a combination with its
Maker. Hence, in our idea of man, there can be no inconsistency with our
idea of God; and if we often feel a certain disagreement with him and
remoteness from him, it is but the more on that account our duty, not
like advocates of the wicked Spirit, to keep our eyes continually upon
the nakedness and weakness of our nature, but rather to seek out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
every property and beauty by which our pretension to a similarity with
the Divinity may be made good."</p>

<p>I smiled, and answered, "Do not make me blush, dear uncle, by your
complaisance in talking in my language! What you have to say is of such
importance to me, that I wish to hear it in your own most peculiar
style; and then what parts of it I cannot quite appropriate I will
endeavor to translate."</p>

<p>"I may continue," he replied, "in my own most peculiar way, without
any alteration of my tone. Man's highest merit always is, as much as
possible to rule external circumstances, and as little as possible to
let himself be ruled by them. Life lies before us, as a huge quarry lies
before the architect: he deserves not the name of architect, except
when, out of this fortuitous mass, he can combine, with the greatest
economy and fitness and durability, some form, the pattern of which
originated in his spirit. All things without us, nay, I may add, all
things on us, are mere elements; but deep within us lies the creative
force, which out of these can produce what they were meant to be, and
which leaves us neither sleep nor rest, till, in one way or another,
without us or on us, that same have been produced. You, my dear niece,
have, it may be, chosen the better part; you have striven to bring your
moral being, your earnest, lovely nature, into accordance with itself
and with the Highest: but neither ought we to be blamed, when we strive
to get acquainted with the sentient man in all his comprehensiveness,
and to bring about an active harmony among his powers."</p>

<p>By such discoursing, we in time grew more familiar; and I begged of him
to speak with me as with himself, omitting every sort of condescension.
"Do not think," replied my uncle, "that I flatter you when I commend
your mode of thinking and acting. I reverence the individual who
understands distinctly what it is he wishes; who unweariedly advances,
who knows the means conducive to his object, and can seize and use them.
How far his object may be great or little, may merit praise or censure,
is the next consideration with me. Believe me, love, most part of all
the misery and mischief, of all that is denominated evil in the world,
arises from the fact, that men are too remiss to get a proper knowledge
of their aims, and, when they do know them, to work intensely in
attaining them. They seem to me like people who have taken up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
notion that they must and will erect a tower, and who yet expend on the
foundation not more stones and labor than would be sufficient for a hut.
If you, my friend, whose highest want it was to perfect and unfold your
moral nature, had, instead of those bold and noble sacrifices, merely
trimmed between your duties to yourself and to your family, your
bridegroom, or perhaps your husband, you must have lived in constant
contradiction with your feelings, and never could have had a peaceful
moment."</p>

<p>"You employ the word sacrifice," I answered here: "and I have often
thought, that to a higher purpose, as to a divinity, we offer up by way
of sacrifice a thing of smaller value; feeling like persons who should
willingly and gladly bring a favorite lamb to the altar for the health
of a beloved father."</p>

<p>"Whatever it may be," said he, "reason or feeling, that commands us to
give up the one thing for the other, to choose the one before the other,
decision and perseverance are, in my opinion, the noblest qualities of
man. You cannot have the ware and the money both at the same time; and
he who always hankers for the ware without having heart to give the
money for it, is no better off than he who repents him of the purchase
when the ware is in his hands. But I am far from blaming men on
this account: it is not they that are to blame; it is the difficult,
entangled situation they are in: they know not how to guide themselves
in its perplexities. Thus, for instance, you will on the average find
fewer bad economists in the country than in towns, and fewer again in
small towns than in great; and why? Man is intended for a limited
condition; objects that are simple, near, determinate, he comprehends,
and he becomes accustomed to employ such means as are at hand; but, on
entering a wider field, he now knows neither what he would nor what he
should; and it amounts to quite the same, whether his attention is
distracted by the multitude of objects, or is overpowered by their
magnitude and dignity. It is always a misfortune for him when he is
induced to struggle after any thing with which he cannot connect
himself by some regular exertion of his powers.</p>

<p>"Certainly," pursued he, "without earnestness there is nothing to be
done in life; yet, among the people whom we name cultivated men, little
earnestness is to be found: in labors and employments, in arts, nay,
even in recreations, they proceed, if I may say so, with a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
self-defence; they live, as they read a heap of newspapers, only to
have done with it; they remind one of that young Englishman at Rome, who
said, with a contented air one evening in some company, that to-day he
had despatched six churches and two galleries. They wish to know and
learn a multitude of things, and precisely those they have the least
concern with; and they never see that hunger is not stilled by snapping
at the air. When I become acquainted with a man, my first inquiry is,
With what does he employ himself, and how, and with what degree of
perseverance? The answer regulates the interest I shall take in him for
life."</p>

<p>"My dear uncle," I replied, "you are, perhaps, too rigorous: you perhaps
withdraw your helping hand from here and there a worthy man to whom you
might be useful."</p>

<p>"Can it be imputed as a fault," said he, "to one who has so long and
vainly labored on them and about them? How much we have to suffer in
our youth from men who think they are inviting us to a delightful
pleasure-party, when they undertake to introduce us to the Danaides or
Sisyphus! Heaven be praised! I have rid myself of these people: if one
of them unfortunately comes within my sphere, I forthwith, in the
politest manner, compliment him out again. It is from such persons that
you hear the bitterest complaints about the miserable course of things,
the aridity of science, the levity of artists, the emptiness of poets,
and much more of that sort. They do not recollect that they, and the
many like them, are the very persons who would never read a book which
had been written just as they require it; that true poetry is alien
to them; that even an excellent work of art can never gain their
approbation except by means of prejudice. But let us now break off,
for this is not the time to rail or to complain."</p>

<p>He directed my attention to the different pictures hanging on the wall:
my eye dwelt on those whose look was beautiful or subject striking. This
he permitted for a while: at last he said, "Bestow a little notice on
the spirit manifested in these other works. Good minds delight to trace
the finger of the Deity in nature: why not likewise pay some small
regard to the hand of his imitator?" He then led my observation to some
unobtrusive figures; endeavoring to make me understand that it was the
history of art alone which could give us an idea of the worth and
dignity of any work of art; that we should know the weary steps of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
mere handicraft and mechanism, over which the man of talents has
struggled in the course of centuries, before we can conceive how it is
possible for the man of genius to move with airy freedom on the pinnacle
whose very aspect makes us giddy.</p>

<p>With this view he had formed a beautiful series of works; and, whilst
he explained it, I could not help conceiving that I saw before me a
similitude of moral culture. When I expressed my thought to him, he
answered, "You are altogether right; and we see from this, that those do
not act well, who, in a solitary, exclusive manner, follow moral
cultivation by itself. On the contrary, it will be found, that he whose
spirit strives for a development of that kind, has likewise every
reason, at the same time, to improve his finer sentient powers; that so
he may not run the risk of sinking from his moral height by giving way
to the enticements of a lawless fancy, and degrading his moral nature by
allowing it to take delight in tasteless baubles, if not in something
worse."</p>

<p>I did not suspect him of levelling at me; but I felt myself struck,
when I reflected how many insipidities there might be in the songs that
used to edify me, and how little favor the figures which had joined
themselves to my religious ideas would have found in the eyes of my
uncle.</p>

<p>Philo, in the mean time, had frequently been busied in the library:
he now took me along with him. We admired the selection, as well as the
multitude, of books. They had been collected on my uncle's general
principle: there were none to be found among them but such as either
lead to correct knowledge, or teach right arrangement; such as either
give us fit materials, or further the concordance of our spirit.</p>

<p>In the course of my life I had read very largely; in certain branches,
there was almost no work unknown to me: the more pleasant was it here to
speak about the general survey of the whole; to mark deficiencies, and
not, as elsewhere, see nothing but a hampered confusion or a boundless
expansion.</p>

<p>Here, too, we became acquainted with a very interesting, quiet man. He
was a physician and a naturalist: he seemed rather one of the <i>Penates</i>
than of the inmates. He showed us the museum, which, like the library,
was fixed in glass cases to the walls of the chambers, adorning and
ennobling the space, which it did not crowd. On this occasion I recalled
with joy the days of my youth, and showed my father many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
things he had been wont to lay upon the sick-bed of his little child,
just opening its little eyes to look into the world then. At the same
time the physician, in our present and following conversations, did
not scruple to avow how near he approximated to me in respect of my
religious sentiments: he warmly praised my uncle for his tolerance,
and his esteem of all that testified or forwarded the worth and unity
of human nature; admitting, also, that he called for a similar return
from others, and would shun and condemn nothing else so heartily as
individual pretension and narrow exclusiveness.</p>

<p>Since the nuptials of my sister, joy had sparkled in the eyes of our
uncle: he often spoke with me of what he meant to do for her and for her
children. He had several fine estates: he managed them himself, and
hoped to leave them in the best condition to his nephews. Regarding the
small estate where we at present were, he appeared to entertain peculiar
thoughts. "I will leave it to none," said he, "but to a person who can
understand and value and enjoy what it contains, and who feels how
loudly every man of wealth and rank, especially in Germany, is called
on to exhibit something like a model to others."</p>

<p>Most of his guests were now gone: we, too, were making ready for
departure, thinking we had seen the final scene of this solemnity, when
his attention in affording us some dignified enjoyment produced a new
surprise. We had mentioned to him the delight which the chorus of
voices, suddenly commencing without accompaniment of any instrument,
had given us, at my sister's marriage. We hinted, at the same time, how
pleasant it would be were such a thing repeated; but he seemed to pay no
heed to us. The livelier was our surprise, when he said, one evening,
"The music of the dance has died away; our transitory, youthful friends
have left us; the happy pair themselves have a more serious look than
they had some days ago. To part at such a time, when, perhaps, we shall
never meet again, certainly never without changes, exalts us to a solemn
mood, which I know not how to entertain more nobly than by the music you
were lately signifying a desire to have repeated."</p>

<p>The chorus, which had in the mean while gathered strength, and by secret
practice more expertness, was accordingly made to sing to us a series of
four and of eight voiced melodies, which, if I may say so, gave a real
foretaste of bliss. Till then I had only known the pious mode of
singing, as good souls practise it, frequently with hoarse pipes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
imagining, like wild birds, that they are praising God, while they
procure a pleasant feeling to themselves. Or, perhaps, I had listened
to the vain music of concerts, in which you are at best invited to
admire the talent of the singer, and very seldom have even a transient
enjoyment. Now, however, I was listening to music, which, as it
originated in the deepest feeling of the most accomplished human beings,
was, by suitable and practised organs in harmonious unity, made again to
address the deepest and best feelings of man, and to impress him at that
moment with a lively sense of his likeness to the Deity. They were all
devotional songs, in the Latin language: they sat like jewels in the
golden ring of a polished intellectual conversation; and, without
pretending to edify, they elevated me and made me happy in the most
spiritual manner.</p>

<p>At our departure he presented all of us with handsome gifts. To me
he gave the cross of my order, more beautifully and artfully worked and
enamelled than I had ever seen it before. It was hung upon a large
brilliant, by which also it was fastened to the chain: this he gave me,
he said, "as the noblest stone in the cabinet of a collector."</p>

<p>My sister, with her husband, went to their estates, the rest of us to
our abodes; appearing to ourselves, so far as outward circumstances were
concerned, to have returned to quite an every-day existence. We had
been, as it were, dropped from a palace of the fairies down upon the
common earth, and were again obliged to help ourselves as we best could.</p>

<p>The singular experiences which this new circle had afforded left a fine
impression on my mind. This, however, did not long continue in its first
vivacity: though my uncle tried to nourish and renew it by sending me
certain of his best and most pleasing works of art; changing them, from
time to time, with others which I had not seen.</p>

<p>I had been so much accustomed to be busied with myself, in regulating
the concerns of my heart and temper, and conversing on these matters
with persons of a like mind, that I could not long study any work of art
attentively without being turned by it back upon myself. I was used to
look at a picture or copper-plate merely as at the letters of a book.
Fine printing pleases well, but who would read a book for the beauty of
the printing? In like manner I required of each pictorial form that it
should tell me something, should instruct, affect, improve me; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
after all my uncle's letters to expound his works of art, say what he
would, I continued in my former humor.</p>

<p>Yet not only my peculiar disposition, but external incidents and changes
in our family, still farther drew me back from contemplations of that
nature; nay, for some time even from myself. I had to suffer and to do
more than my slender strength seemed fit for.</p>

<p>My maiden sister had, till now, been as a right arm to me. Healthy,
strong, unspeakably good-natured, she had managed all the housekeeping;
I myself being busied with the personal nursing of our aged father. She
was seized with a catarrh, which changed to a disorder of the lungs: in
three weeks she was lying in her coffin. Her death inflicted wounds on
me, the scars of which I am not yet willing to examine.</p>

<p>I was lying sick before they buried her: the old ailment in my breast
appeared to be awakening; I coughed with violence, and was so hoarse I
could not speak beyond a whisper.</p>

<p>My married sister, out of fright and grief, was brought to bed before
her time. Our old father thought he was about to lose at once his
children and the hope of their posterity; his natural tears increased
my sorrow: I prayed to God that he would give me back a sufferable state
of health. I asked him but to spare my life till my father should die.
I recovered: I was what I reckoned well, being able to discharge my
duties, though with pain.</p>

<p>My sister was again with child. Many cares, which in such cases are
committed to the mother, in the present instance fell to me. She was not
altogether happy with her husband; this was to be hidden from our
father: I was often made judge of their disputes, in which I could
decide with the greater safety, as my brother trusted in me; and the two
were really worthy persons, only each of them, instead of humoring,
endeavored to convince, the other, and, out of eagerness to live in
constant harmony, never could agree. I now learned to mingle seriously
in worldly matters, and to practise what of old I had but sung.</p>

<p>My sister bore a son: the frailty of my father did not hinder him from
travelling to her. The sight of the child exceedingly enlivened and
cheered him: at the christening, contrary to his custom, he seemed as if
inspired; nay, I might say like a Genius with two faces. With the one,
he looked joyfully forward to those regions which he soon hoped to
enter; with the other, to the new, hopeful, earthly life which had
arisen in the boy descended from him. On our journey home he never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
wearied talking to me of the child, its form, its health, and his wish
that the gifts of this new denizen of earth might be rightly cultivated.
His reflections on the subject lasted when we had arrived at home: it
was not till some days afterwards that I observed a kind of fever in
him, which displayed itself, without shivering, in a sort of languid
heat commencing after dinner. He did not yield, however: he went out as
usual in the mornings, faithfully attending to the duties of his office,
till at last continuous serious symptoms kept him within doors.</p>

<p>I never shall forget with what distinctness, clearness, and repose of
mind he settled in the greatest order the concerns of his house, nay,
the arrangements of his funeral, as he would have done a business of
some other person.</p>

<p>With a cheerfulness which he never used to show, and which now mounted
to a lively joy, he said to me, "Where is the fear of death which I once
felt? Shall I shrink at departing? I have a gracious God; the grave
awakens no terror in me; I have an eternal life."</p>

<p>To recall the circumstances of his death, which shortly followed, forms
one of the most pleasing entertainments of my solitude: the visible
workings of a higher Power in that solemn time, no one shall ever argue
from me.</p>

<p>The death of my beloved father altogether changed my mode of life. From
the strictest obedience, the narrowest confinement, I passed at once
into the greatest freedom: I enjoyed it like a sort of food from which
one has long abstained. Formerly I very seldom spent two hours from
home: now I very seldom lived a day there. My friends, whom I had been
allowed to visit only by hurried snatches, wished now to have my company
without interruption, as I did to have theirs. I was often asked to
dinner: at walks and pleasure-jaunts I never failed. But, when once the
circle had been fairly run, I saw that the invaluable happiness of
liberty consisted, not in doing what one pleases and what circumstances
may invite to, but in being able, without hinderance or restraint, to do
in the direct way what one regards as right and proper; and, in this
instance, I was old enough to reach a valuable truth, without smarting
for my ignorance.</p>

<p>One pleasure I could not deny myself: it was, as soon as might be, to
renew and strengthen my connection with the Herrnhut Brethren. I
hastened, accordingly, to visit one of their establishments at no great
distance; but here I by no means found what I had been anticipating.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
I was frank enough to signify my disappointment, which they tried to
soften by alleging that the present settlement was nothing to a full and
fitly organized community. This I did not take upon me to deny; yet, in
my thought, the genuine spirit of the matter might have displayed itself
in a small body as well as in a great one.</p>

<p>One of their bishops, who was present, a personal disciple of the count,
took considerable pains with me. He spoke English perfectly; and as I,
too, understood a little of it, he reckoned this a token that we both
belonged to one class. I, however, reckoned nothing of the kind: his
conversation did not in the least satisfy me. He had been a cutler; was
a native of Moravia; his mode of thought still savored of the artisan.
With Herr Von L&mdash;&mdash;, who had been a major in the French
service, I got upon a better footing: yet I could never bring myself to
the submissiveness he showed to his superiors; nay, I felt as if you had
given me a box on the ear, when I saw the major's wife, and other women
more or less like ladies, take the bishop's hand and kiss it. Meanwhile
a journey into Holland was proposed; which, however, doubtless for my
good, did not take place.</p>

<p>My sister had been delivered of a daughter; and now it was the turn of
us women to exult, and consider how the little creature should be bred
like one of us. The husband, on the other hand, was not so satisfied,
when in the following year another daughter saw the light: with his
large estates, he wanted to have boys about him, who in future might
assist him in his management.</p>

<p>My health was feeble: I kept myself in peace, and, by a quiet mode of
life, in tolerable equilibrium. I was not afraid of death; nay, I wished
to die: yet I secretly perceived that God was granting time for me to
prove my soul, and to advance still nearer to himself. In my many
sleepless nights, especially, I have at times felt something which I
cannot undertake to describe.</p>

<p>It was as if my soul were thinking separately from the body: she looked
upon the body as a foreign substance, as we look upon a garment. She
pictured with extreme vivacity events and times long past, and felt, by
means of this, events that were to follow. Those times are all gone by;
what follows likewise will go by; the body, too, will fall to pieces
like a vesture; but I, the well-known I, I am.</p>

<p>The thought is great, exalted, and consoling; yet an excellent friend,
with whom I every day became more intimate, instructed me to dwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
on it as little as I could. This was the physician whom I met in my
uncle's house, and who had since accurately informed himself about the
temper of my body and my spirit. He showed me how much these feelings,
when we cherish them within us independently of outward objects, tend,
as it were, to excavate us, and to undermine the whole foundation of our
being. "To be active," he would say, "is the primary vocation of man:
all the intervals in which he is obliged to rest, he should employ in
gaining clearer knowledge of external things; for this will in its turn
facilitate activity."</p>

<p>This friend was acquainted with my custom of looking on my body as
an outward object: he knew also that I pretty well understood my
constitution, my disorder, and the medicines of use for it; nay, that,
by continual sufferings of my own or other people's, I had really grown
a kind of half-doctor: he now carried forward my attention from the
human body, and the drugs which act upon it, to the kindred objects of
creation; he led me up and down as in the paradise of the first man;
only, if I may continue my comparison, allowing me to trace, in dim
remoteness, the Creator walking in the garden in the cool of the
evening.</p>

<p>How gladly did I now see God in nature, when I bore him with such
certainty within my heart! How interesting to me was his handiwork! how
thankful did I feel that he had pleased to quicken me with the breath of
his mouth!</p>

<p>We again had hopes that my sister would present us with a boy: her
husband waited anxiously for that event, but did not live to see it. He
died in consequence of an unlucky fall from horseback; and my sister
followed him, soon after she had brought into the world a lovely boy.
The four orphans they had left I could not look at but with sadness. So
many healthy people had been called away before poor, sickly me; might I
not also have blights to witness among these fair and hopeful blossoms?
I knew the world sufficiently to understand what dangers threaten the
precarious breeding of a child, especially a child of quality; and it
seemed as if, since the period of my youth, these dangers had increased.
I felt that, weakly as I was, I could not be of much, perhaps of any,
service to the little ones; and I rejoiced the more on finding that my
uncle, as indeed might have been looked for, had determined to devote
his whole attention to the education of these amiable creatures. And
this they doubtless merited in every sense: they were handsome; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
with great diversities, all promised to be well-conditioned, reasonable
persons.</p>

<p>Since my worthy doctor had suggested it, I loved to trace out family
likenesses among our relatives and children. My father had carefully
preserved the portraits of his ancestors, and got his own and those of
his descendants drawn by tolerable masters; nor had my mother and her
people been forgotten. We accurately knew the characters of all the
family; and, as we had frequently compared them with each other, we now
endeavored to discover in the children the same peculiarities outward or
inward. My sister's eldest son, we thought, resembled his paternal
grandfather, of whom there was a fine youthful picture in my uncle's
collection: he had been a brave soldier; and in this point, too, the
boy took after him, liking arms above all things, and busying himself
with them whenever he paid me a visit. For my father had left a very
pretty armory; and the boy got no rest till I had given him a pair of
pistols and a fowling-piece, and he had learned the proper way of using
them. At the same time, in his conduct or bearing, there was nothing
like rudeness: far from that, he was always meek and sensible.</p>

<p>The eldest daughter had attracted my especial love; of which, perhaps,
the reason was, that she resembled me, and of all the four seemed to
like me best. But I may well admit, that, the more closely I observed
her as she grew, the more she shamed me: I could not look on her without
a sentiment of admiration, nay, I may almost say, of reverence. You
would scarcely have seen a nobler form, a more peaceful spirit, an
activity so equable and universal. No moment of her life was she
unoccupied, and every occupation in her hands became dignified. All
seemed indifferent to her, so that she could but accomplish what was
proper in the place and time; and, in the same manner, she could
patiently continue unemployed, when there was nothing to be done. This
activity without need of occupation I have never elsewhere met with. In
particular, her conduct to the suffering and destitute was, from her
earliest youth, inimitable. For my part, I freely confess I never had
the gift to make a business of beneficence: I was not niggardly to the
poor; nay, I often gave too largely for my means; yet this was little
more than buying myself off: and a person needed to be made for me, if I
was to bestow attention on him. Directly the reverse was the conduct of
my niece. I never saw her give a poor man money: whatever she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
obtained from me for this purpose, she failed not in the first place to
change for some necessary article. Never did she seem more lovely in my
eyes, than when rummaging my clothes-presses: she was always sure to
light on something which I did not wear and did not need; to sew these
old cast-off articles together, and put them on some ragged child, she
thought her highest happiness.</p>

<p>Her sister's turn of mind appeared already different: she had much of
her mother; she promised to become very elegant and beautiful, and she
now bids fair to keep her promise. She is greatly taken up with her
exterior: from her earliest years she could decorate and carry herself
in a way that struck you. I still remember with what ecstasy, when
quite a little creature, she saw herself in a mirror, decked in certain
precious pearls, once my mother's, which she had by chance discovered,
and made me try upon her.</p>

<p>Reflecting on these diverse inclinations, it was pleasant for me to
consider how my property would, after my decease, be shared among them,
and again called into use. I saw the fowling-pieces of my father once
more travelling round the fields on my nephew's shoulder, and birds once
more falling from his hunting-pouch: I saw my whole wardrobe issuing
from the church, at Easter Confirmation, on the persons of tidy little
girls; while the best pieces of it were employed to decorate some
virtuous burgher maiden on her marriage-day. In furnishing such children
and poor little girls, Natalia had a singular delight; though, as I must
here remark, she showed not the smallest love, or, if I may say it,
smallest need, of a dependence upon any visible or invisible Being, such
as I had in my youth so strongly manifested.</p>

<p>When I also thought that the younger sister, on that same day,
would wear my jewels and pearls at court, I could see with peace
my possessions, like my body, given back to the elements.</p>

<p>The children waxed apace: to my comfort, they are healthy, handsome,
clever creatures. That my uncle keeps them from me, I endure without
repining: when staying in the neighborhood, or even in town, they seldom
see me.</p>

<p>A singular personage, regarded as a French clergyman, though no one
rightly knows his history, has been intrusted with the oversight of all
these children. He has them taught in various places: they are put to
board now here, now there.</p>

<p>At first I could perceive no plan whatever in this mode of education;
till at last our doctor told me the abbé had convinced my uncle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
that, in order to accomplish any thing by education, we must first
become acquainted with the pupil's tendencies and wishes; that, these
once ascertained, he ought to be transported to a situation where he
may, as speedily as possible, content the former and attain the latter,
and so, if he have been mistaken, may still in time perceive his error,
and at last, having found what suits him, may hold the faster by it, may
the more diligently fashion himself according to it. I wish this strange
experiment may prosper: with such excellent natures it is, perhaps,
possible.</p>

<p>But there is one peculiarity in these instructors, which I never
shall approve of: they study to seclude the children from whatever might
awaken them to an acquaintance with themselves and with the invisible,
sole, faithful Friend. I often take it ill of my uncle, that, on this
account, he considers me dangerous for the little ones. Thus in practice
there is no man tolerant! Many assure us that they willingly leave each
to take his own way, yet all endeavor to exclude from action every one
that does not think as they do.</p>

<p>This removal of the children troubles me the more, the more I am
convinced of the reality of my belief. How can it fail to have a
heavenly origin, an actual object, when in practice it is so effectual?
Is it not by practice alone that we prove our own existence? Why, then,
may we not, by a like mode, prove to ourselves the influence of that
Power who gives us all good things?</p>

<p>That I am still advancing, never retrograding; that my conduct is
approximating more and more to the image I have formed of perfection;
that I every day feel more facility in doing what I reckon proper, even
while the weakness of my body so obstructs me,&mdash;can all this be
accounted for upon the principles of human nature, whose corruption I
have so clearly seen into? For me, at least, it cannot.</p>

<p>I scarcely remember a commandment: to me there is nothing that assumes
the aspect of law; it is an impulse that leads me, and guides me always
aright. I freely follow my emotions, and know as little of constraint as
of repentance. God be praised that I know to whom I am indebted for such
happiness, and that I cannot think of it without humility! There is no
danger I should ever become proud of what I myself can do or can forbear
to do: I have seen too well what a monster might be formed and nursed in
every human bosom, did not higher Influence restrain us.</p>

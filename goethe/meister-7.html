<h1>Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship</h1>
<h2>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</h2>
<h3>Translated by Thomas Carlyle (1839)</h3>
<h3>BOOK VII</h3>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>Spring had come in all its brilliancy; a storm that had been lowering
all day went fiercely down upon the hills; the rain drew back into the
country; the sun came forth in all its splendor, and upon the dark vapor
rose the lordly rainbow. Wilhelm was riding towards it: the sight made
him sad. "Ah!" said he within himself, "must it be that the fairest hues
of life appear to us only on a ground of black? And must drops fall, if
we are to be enraptured? A bright day is like a dull day, if we look at
it unmoved; and what can move us but some silent hope that the inborn
inclination of our soul shall not always be without an object? The
recital of a noble action moves us; the sight of every thing harmonious
moves us: we feel then as if we were not altogether in a foreign land;
we fancy we are nearer the home towards which our best and inmost wishes
impatiently strive."</p>

<p>Meanwhile a pedestrian overtook him, and, walking with a stout step
by the side of the horse, began to keep him company. After a few common
words, he looked at the rider, and said, "If I am not mistaken, I must
have already seen you somewhere."</p>

<p>"I, too, remember you," said Wilhelm: "had we not some time ago a
pleasant sail together?"&mdash;"Right!" replied the other.</p>

<p>Wilhelm looked at him more narrowly, then, after a pause, observed, "I
do not know what alteration has occurred in you. Last time we met, I
took you for a Lutheran country clergyman: you now seem to me more like
a Catholic priest."</p>

<p>"To-day, at least, you are not wrong," replied the other, taking off
his hat, and showing him the tonsure. "Where is your company gone? Did
you stay long with them?"</p>

<p>"Longer than was good: on looking back upon the period which I
passed in their society, it seems as if I looked into an endless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
void; nothing of it has remained with me."</p>

<p>"Here you are mistaken," said the stranger: "every thing that happens
to us leaves some trace behind it; every thing contributes imperceptibly
to form us. Yet often it is dangerous to take a strict account of that.
For either we grow proud and negligent, or downcast and dispirited; and
both are equally injurious in their consequences. The safe plan is,
always simply to do the task that lies nearest us; and this in the
present case," added he, with a smile, "is to hasten to our quarters."</p>

<p>Wilhelm asked how far Lothario's house was distant: the stranger
answered that it lay behind the hill. "Perhaps I shall meet you there,"
continued he: "I have merely a small affair to manage in the
neighborhood. Farewell till then!" And, with this, he struck into a
steep path that seemed to lead more speedily across the hill.</p>

<p>"Yes, the man is right!" said Wilhelm to himself, as he proceeded:
"we should think of what is nearest; and for me, at present, there is
nothing nearer than the mournful errand I have come to do. Let me see
whether I can still repeat the speech, which is to put that cruel man to
shame."</p>

<p>He then began reciting to himself this piece of oratory: not a syllable
was wanting; and the more his recollection served him, the higher grew
his passion and his courage. Aurelia's sorrows and her death were
vividly present to his soul.</p>

<p>"Spirit of my friend!" exclaimed he, "hover round me, and, if thou
canst, give some sign to me that thou art softened, art appeased!"</p>

<p>Amid such words and meditations, he had reached the summit of the hill;
and, near the foot of its declivity, he now beheld a curious building,
which he at once took to be Lothario's dwelling. An old, irregular
castle, with several turrets and peaked roofs, appeared to have been the
primitive erection; but the new additions to it, placed near the main
structure, looked still more irregular. A part of them stood close upon
the main edifice: others, at some distance, were combined with it by
galleries and covered passages. All external symmetry, every shade of
architectural beauty, appeared to have been sacrificed to the
convenience of the interior. No trace of wall or trench was to be seen;
none of avenues or artificial gardens. A fruit and pot-herb garden
reached to the very buildings, and little patches of a like sort showed
themselves even in the intermediate spaces. A cheerful village lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
at no great distance: the fields and gardens everywhere appeared in the
highest state of cultivation.</p>

<p>Sunk in his own impassioned feelings, Wilhelm rode along, not thinking
much of what he saw: he put up his horse at an inn, and, not without
emotion, hastened to the castle.</p>

<p>An old serving-man received him at the door, and signified, with
much good-nature, that to-day it would be difficult to get admission
to his lordship, who was occupied in writing letters, and had already
refused some people that had business with him. Our friend became more
importunate: the old man was at last obliged to yield, and announce him.
He returned, and conducted Wilhelm to a spacious, ancient hall; desiring
him to be so good as wait, since perhaps it might be some time before
his lordship could appear. Our friend walked up and down unrestfully,
casting now and then a look at the knights and dames whose ancient
figures hung round him on the walls. He repeated the beginning of his
speech: it seemed, in presence of these ruffs and coats of mail, to
answer even better. Every time there rose any stir, he put himself in
posture to receive his man with dignity; meaning first to hand him the
letter, then assail him with the weapons of reproach.</p>

<p>More than once mistaken, he was now beginning to be really vexed
and out of tune, when at last a handsome man, in boots and light
surtout, stepped in from a side-door. "What good news have you for me?"
said he to Wilhelm, with a friendly voice: "pardon me, that I have made
you wait."</p>

<p>So speaking, he kept folding a letter which he held in his hand.
Wilhelm, not without embarrassment, delivered him Aurelia's paper, and
replied, "I bring you the last words of a friend, which you will not
read without emotion."</p>

<p>Lothario took it, and returned to his chamber with it; where, as
Wilhelm through the open door could very easily observe, he addressed
and sealed some letters before opening Aurelia's. He appeared to have
perused it once or twice; and Wilhelm, though his feelings signified
that the pathetic speech would sort but ill with such a cool reception,
girded up his mind, went forward to the threshold, and was just about
beginning his address, when a tapestry-door of the cabinet opened, and
the clergyman came in.</p>

<p>"I have got the strangest message you can think of," cried Lothario
to him. "Pardon me," continued he, addressing Wilhelm, "if I am not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
in a mood for speaking further with you at this moment. You remain with
us to-night: you, abbé, see the stranger properly attended to."</p>

<p>With these words, he made his guest a bow: the clergyman took Wilhelm
by the hand, who followed, not without reluctance.</p>

<p>They walked along some curious passages in silence, and at last reached
a very pretty chamber. The abbé led him in, then left him, making no
excuses. Erelong an active boy appeared: he introduced himself as
Wilhelm's valet, and brought up his supper. In waiting, he had much to
say about the order of the house, about their breakfasting and dining,
labors and amusements; interspersing many things in commendation of
Lothario.</p>

<p>Pleasant as the boy was, Wilhelm endeavored to get rid of him as soon
as possible. He wished to be alone, for he felt exceedingly oppressed
and straitened in his new position. He reproached himself with having
executed his intention so ill, with having done his errand only half.
One moment, he proposed to undertake next morning what he had neglected
to-night; the next, he saw, that, by Lothario's presence, he would be
attuned to quite a different set of feelings. The house, too, where he
was, seemed very strange to him: he could not be at home in his
position. Intending to undress, he opened his travelling-bag: with his
night-clothes, he took out the Spirit's veil, which Mignon had packed in
along with them. The sight of it increased the sadness of his humor.
"Flee, youth! flee!" cried he. "What means this mystic word? What am I
to flee, or whither? It were better had the Spirit called to me, Return
to thyself!" He cast his eyes on some English copper-plates hung round
the room in frames; most of them he looked at with indifference: at last
he met with one, in which a ship was represented sinking in a tempest; a
father, with his lovely daughters, was awaiting death from the intrusive
billows. One of the maidens had a kind of likeness to the Amazon: an
indescribable compassion seized our friend; he felt an irresistible
necessity to vent his feelings; tears filled his eyes, he wept, and did
not recover his composure till slumber overpowered him.</p>

<p>Strange dreams arose upon him towards morning. He was in a garden,
which in boyhood he had often visited: he looked with pleasure at the
well-known alleys, hedges, flower-beds. Mariana met him: he spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
to her with love and tenderness, recollecting nothing of any by-gone
grievance. Erelong his father joined them, in his week-day dress; with a
look of frankness that was rare in him, he bade his son fetch two seats
from the garden-house; then took Mariana by the hand, and led her into a
grove.</p>

<p>Wilhelm hastened to the garden-house, but found it altogether empty:
only at a window in the farther side he saw Aurelia standing. He went
forward, and addressed her, but she turned not round; and, though he
placed himself beside her, he could never see her face. He looked out
from the window: in an unknown garden, there were several people, some
of whom he recognized. Frau Melina, seated under a tree, was playing
with a rose which she had in her hand: Laertes stood beside her,
counting money from the one hand to the other. Mignon and Felix were
lying on the grass, the former on her back, the latter on his face.
Philina came, and clapped her hands above the children: Mignon lay
unmoved; Felix started up and fled. At first he laughed while running,
as Philina followed; but he screamed in terror when he saw the harper
coming after him with large, slow steps. Felix ran directly to a pond.
Wilhelm hastened after him: too late; the child was lying in the water!
Wilhelm stood as if rooted to the spot. The fair Amazon appeared on the
other side of the pond: she stretched her right hand towards the child,
and walked along the shore. The child came through the water, by the
course her finger pointed to; he followed her as she went round; at last
she reached her hand to him, and pulled him out. Wilhelm had come
nearer: the child was all in flames; fiery drops were falling from his
body. Wilhelm's agony was greater than ever; but instantly the Amazon
took a white veil from her head, and covered up the child with it. The
fire was at once quenched. But, when she lifted up the veil, two boys
sprang out from under it, and frolicsomely sported to and fro; while
Wilhelm and the Amazon proceeded hand in hand across the garden, and
noticed in the distance Mariana and his father walking in an alley,
which was formed of lofty trees, and seemed to go quite round the
garden. He turned his steps to them, and, with his beautiful attendant,
was moving through the garden, when suddenly the fair-haired Friedrich
came across their path, and kept them back with loud laughter and a
thousand tricks. Still, however, they insisted on proceeding; and
Friedrich hastened off, running towards Mariana and the father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
These seemed to flee before him; he pursued the faster, till Wilhelm saw
them hovering down the alley almost as on wings. Nature and inclination
called on him to go and help them, but the hand of the Amazon detained
him. How gladly did he let himself be held! With this mingled feeling
he awoke, and found his chamber shining with the morning beams.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>Our friend was called to breakfast by the boy: he found the abbé waiting
in the hall; Lothario, it appeared, had ridden out. The abbé was not
very talkative, but rather wore a thoughtful look: he inquired about
Aurelia's death, and listened to our friend's recital of it with
apparent sympathy. "Ah!" cried he, "the man that discerns, with lively
clearness, what infinite operations art and nature must have
joined in before a cultivated human being can be formed; the man that
himself as much as possible takes interest in the culture of his
fellow-men,&mdash;is ready to despair when he sees how lightly mortals
will destroy themselves, will blamelessly or blamably expose themselves
to be destroyed. When I think of these things, life itself appears to me
so uncertain a gift, that I could praise the man who does not value it
beyond its worth."</p>

<p>Scarcely had he spoken, when the door flew violently up: a young lady
came rushing in; she pushed away the old servant, who attempted to
restrain her. She made right to the abbé, and seized him by the arm:
her tears and sobs would hardly let her speak these words: "Where is he?
Where have you put him? 'Tis a frightful treachery! Confess it now! I
know what you are doing: I will after him,&mdash;will know where you
have sent him!"</p>

<p>"Be calm, my child," replied the abbé, with assumed composure; "come
with me to your room: you shall know it all; only you must have the
strength to listen, if you ask me to relate." He offered her his hand,
as if he meant to lead her out. "I will not return to my room," cried
she: "I hate the walls where you have kept me prisoner so long. I know
it already: the colonel has challenged him; he is gone to meet his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
enemy: perhaps this very moment he&mdash;once or twice I thought I heard
the sound of shots! I tell you, order out a coach, and come along with
me, or I will fill the house and all the village with my screaming."</p>

<p>Weeping bitterly, she hastened to the window: the abbé held her back,
and sought in vain to soothe her.</p>

<p>They heard a sound of wheels: she threw up the window, exclaiming, "He
is dead! They are bringing home his body."&mdash;"He is coming out,"
replied the abbé: "you perceive he lives."&mdash;"He is wounded," said
she wildly, "else he would have come on horseback. They are holding him!
The wound is dangerous!" She ran to the door, and down the stairs: the
abbé hastened after her; and Wilhelm, following, observed the fair one
meet her lover, who had now dismounted.</p>

<p>Lothario leaned on his attendant, whom Wilhelm at once knew as his
ancient patron, Jarno. The wounded man spoke very tenderly and kindly to
the tearful damsel: he rested on her shoulder, and came slowly up the
steps, saluted Wilhelm as he passed, and was conducted to his cabinet.</p>

<p>Jarno soon returned, and, going up to Wilhelm, "It appears," said he,
"you are predestined everywhere to find a theatre and actors. We have
here commenced a play which is not altogether pleasant."</p>

<p>"I rejoice to find you," answered Wilhelm, "in so strange an hour:
I am astonished, frightened; and your presence already quiets my mind.
Tell me, is there danger? Is the baron badly wounded?"</p>

<p>"I imagine not," said Jarno.</p>

<p>It was not long till the young surgeon entered from the cabinet. "Now,
what say you?" cried Jarno to him. "That it is a dangerous piece of
work," replied the other, putting several instruments into his leathern
pouch. Wilhelm looked at the band, which was hanging from the pouch: he
fancied he knew it. Bright, contrary colors, a curious pattern, gold and
silver wrought in singular figures, marked this band from all the bands
in the world. Wilhelm was convinced he beheld the very pouch of the
ancient surgeon who had dressed his wounds in the green of the forest;
and the hope, so long deferred, of again finding traces of the lovely
Amazon, struck like a flame through all his soul.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that pouch?" cried he. "To whom did it belong before
you? I beg of you, tell me."&mdash;"I bought it at an auction," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
the other: "what is it to me whom it belonged to?" So speaking, he went
out; and Jarno said, "If there would come but one word of truth from our
young doctor's mouth!"&mdash;"Then, he did not buy the pouch?" said
Wilhelm. "Just as little as Lothario is in danger," said the other.</p>

<p>Wilhelm stood, immersed in many reflections: Jarno asked how he had
fared of late. Wilhelm sketched an outline of his history; and when he
at last came to speak of Aurelia's death, and his message to the place,
his auditor exclaimed, "Well! it is strange! most strange!"</p>

<p>The abbé entered from Lothario's chamber, beckoned Jarno to go in
instead of him, and said to Wilhelm, "The baron bids me ask you to
remain with us a day or two, to share his hospitality, and, in the
present circumstances, contribute to his solacement. If you need to give
any notice to your people, your letter shall be instantly despatched.
Meanwhile, to make you understand this curious incident, of which you
have been witness, I must tell you something, which, indeed, is no
secret. The baron had a small adventure with a lady, which excited more
than usual attention; the lady having taken him from a rival, and
wishing to enjoy her victory too ostentatiously. After a time he no
longer found the same delight in her society; which he, of course,
forsook: but, being of a violent temper, she could not bear her fate
with patience. Meeting at a ball, they had an open quarrel: she thought
herself irreparably injured, and would be revenged. No knight stepped
forth to do battle for her; till her husband, whom for years she had not
lived with, heard of the affair and took it up. He challenged the baron,
and to-day he has wounded him; yet, as I hear, the gallant colonel has
himself come still worse off."</p>

<p>From this hour our friend was treated in the house as if he had belonged
to it.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>At times they had read a little to the patient: Wilhelm joyfully
performed this service. Lydia stirred not from Lothario's bed: her care
for him absorbed her whole attention. But to-day the patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
himself seemed occupied with thought: he bade them lay aside their book.
"To-day," said he, "I feel through my whole heart how foolishly we let
our time pass on. How many things have I proposed to do, how many have I
planned; yet how we loiter in our noblest purposes! I have just read
over the scheme of the changes which I mean to make in my estates; and
it is chiefly, I may say, on their account that I rejoice at the
bullet's not having gone a deadlier road."</p>

<p>Lydia looked at him with tenderness, with tears in her eyes; as if to
ask if <i>she</i>, if his friends, could not pretend to any interest in
his wish to live. Jarno answered, "Changes such as you project require
to be considered well on every side before they are resolved on."</p>

<p>"Long considerations," said Lothario, "are commonly a proof that we
have not the point to be determined clearly in our eye; precipitate
proceedings, that we do not know it. I see distinctly, that, in managing
my property, there are several particulars in which the services of my
dependants cannot be remitted; certain rights which I must rigidly
insist on: but I also see that there are other articles, advantageous to
me, but by no means indispensable, which might admit of relaxation. Do I
not profit by my lands far better than my father did? Is not my income
still increasing? And shall I alone enjoy this growing benefit? Shall
not those who labor with and for me partake, in their degree, of the
advantages which expanding knowledge, which a period of improvement, are
procuring for us?"</p>

<p>"'Tis human nature!" cried Jarno: "I do not blame myself when I detect
this selfish quality among the rest. Every man desires to gather all
things round him, to shape and manage them according to his own
pleasure: the money which he himself does not expend, he seldom reckons
well expended."</p>

<p>"Certainly," observed Lothario, "much of the capital might be abated
if we consumed the interest less capriciously."</p>

<p>"The only thing I shall mention," said the other, "the only reason I can
urge against your now proceeding with those alterations, which, for a
time at least, must cause you loss, is, that you yourself are still in
debt, and that the payment presses hard on you. My advice is, therefore,
to postpone your plan till you are altogether free."</p>

<p>"And in the mean while leave it at the mercy of a bullet, or the
fall of a tile, to annihilate the whole result of my existence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
activity! O my friend! it is ever thus: it is ever the besetting fault
of cultivated men, that they wish to spend their whole resources on some
idea, scarcely any part of them on tangible, existing objects. Why was
it that I contracted debts, that I quarrelled with my uncle, that I left
my sisters to themselves so long? Purely for the sake of an idea. In
America I fancied I might accomplish something; over seas, I hoped to
become useful and essential: if any task was not begirt with a thousand
dangers, I considered it trivial, unworthy of me. How differently do
matters now appear! How precious, how important, seems the duty which is
nearest me, whatever it may be!"</p>

<p>"I recollect the letter which you sent me from the Western world," said
Jarno: "it contains the words, 'I will return; and in my house, amid my
fields, among my people, I will say, <i>Here or nowhere is America</i>!'"</p>

<p>"Yes, my friend; and I am still repeating it, and still repining at
myself that I am not so busy here as I was there. For certain equable,
continuous modes of life, there is nothing more than judgment necessary,
and we study to attain nothing more: so that we become unable to discern
what extraordinary services each vulgar day requires of us; or, if we
do discern them, we find abundance of excuses for not doing them. A
judicious man is valuable to himself, but of little value for the
general whole."</p>

<p>"We will not," said Jarno, "bear too hard upon judgment: let us grant,
that, whenever extraordinary things are done, they are generally
foolish."</p>

<p>"Yes! and just because they are not done according to the proper plan.
My brother-in-law, you see, is giving up his fortune, so far as in his
power, to the Community of Herrnhut: he reckons, that, by doing so, he
is advancing the salvation of his soul. Had he sacrificed a small
portion of his revenue, he might have rendered many people happy, might
have made for them and for himself a heaven upon earth. Our sacrifices
are rarely of an active kind: we, as it were, abandon what we give away.
It is not from resolution, but despair, that we renounce our property.
In these days, I confess it, the image of the count is hovering
constantly before me: I have firmly resolved on doing from conviction
what a crazy fear is forcing upon him. I will not wait for being cured.
Here are the papers: they require only to be properly drawn out. Take
the lawyer with you; our guest will help: what I want, you know as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
well as I; recovering or dying. I will stand by it, and say, <i>Here or
nowhere is Herrnhut</i>!"</p>

<p>When he mentioned dying, Lydia sank before his bed: she hung upon his
arm, and wept bitterly. The surgeon entered: Jarno gave our friend the
papers, and made Lydia leave the room.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake! what is this about the count?" cried Wilhelm, when
they reached the hall and were alone. "What count is it that means to
join the Herrnhuters?"</p>

<p>"One whom you know very well," said Jarno. "You yourself are the ghost
who have frightened the unhappy wiseacre into piety: you are the villain
who have brought his pretty wife to such a state that she inclines
accompanying him."</p>

<p>"And she is Lothario's sister?" cried our friend.</p>

<p>"No other!"&mdash;"And Lothario knows"&mdash;</p>

<p>"The whole!"</p>

<p>"Oh, let me fly!" cried Wilhelm. "How shall I appear before him? What
can he say to me?"</p>

<p>"That no man should cast a stone at his brother; that when one composes
long speeches, with a view to shame his neighbors, he should speak them
to a looking-glass."</p>

<p>"Do you know that too?"</p>

<p>"And many things beside," said Jarno, with a smile. "But in the present
case," continued he, "you shall not get away from me so easily as you
did last time. You need not now be apprehensive of my bounty-money: I
have ceased to be a soldier; when I was one, you might have thought more
charitably of me. Since you saw me, many things have altered. My prince,
my only friend and benefactor, being dead, I have now withdrawn from
busy life and its concerns. I used to have a pleasure in advancing what
was reasonable; when I met with any despicable thing, I hesitated not to
call it so; and men had never done with talking of my restless head and
wicked tongue. The herd of people dread sound understanding more than
any thing: they ought to dread stupidity, if they had any notion what
was really dreadful. Understanding is unpleasant, they must have it
pushed aside; stupidity is but pernicious, they can let it stay. Well,
be it so! I need to live: I will by and by communicate my plans to you;
if you incline, you shall partake in them. But tell me first how things
have gone with you. I see, I feel, that you are changed. How is it with
your ancient maggot of producing something beautiful and good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
in the society of gypsies?"</p>

<p>"Do not speak of it!" cried Wilhelm: "I have been already punished
for it. People talk about the stage, but none that has not been upon
it can form the smallest notion of it. How utterly these men are
unacquainted with themselves, how thoughtlessly they carry on their
trade, how boundless their pretensions are, no mortal can conceive.
Each would be not only first, but sole; each wishes to exclude the rest,
and does not see that even with them he can scarcely accomplish any
thing. Each thinks himself a man of marvellous originality; yet, with a
ravening appetite for novelty, he cannot walk a footstep from the beaten
track. How vehemently they counterwork each other! It is only the
pitifullest self-love, the narrowest views of interest, that unite them.
Of reciprocal accommodation they have no idea: backbiting and hidden
spitefulness maintain a constant jealousy among them. In their lives
they are either rakes or simpletons. Each claims the loftiest respect,
each writhes under the slightest blame. 'All this he knew already,'
he will tell you! Why, then, did he not do it? Ever needy, ever
unconfiding, they seem as if their greatest fear were reason and good
taste; their highest care, to secure the majesty of their self-will."</p>

<p>Wilhelm drew breath, intending to proceed with his eulogium, when an
immoderate laugh from Jarno interrupted him. "Poor actors!" cried he;
threw himself into a chair, and laughed away. "Poor, dear actors! Do you
know, my friend," continued he, recovering from his fit, "that you have
been describing, not the playhouse, but the world; that, out of all
ranks, I could find you characters and doings in abundance to suit your
cruel pencil? Pardon me: it makes me laugh again, that you should think
these amiable qualities existed on the boards alone."</p>

<p>Wilhelm checked his feelings. Jarno's extravagant, untimely laughter
had in truth offended him. "It is scarcely hiding your misanthropy,"
said he, "when you maintain that faults like these are universal."</p>

<p>"And it shows your unacquaintance with the world, when you impute them
to the theatre in such a heinous light. I pardon, in the player, every
fault that springs from self-deception and the desire to please. If he
seem not something to himself and others, he is nothing. To seem is his
vocation; he must prize his moment of applause, for he gets no other
recompense; he must try to glitter,&mdash;he is there to do so."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will give me leave at least to smile, in my turn," answered
Wilhelm. "I should never have believed that you could be so merciful,
so tolerant."</p>

<p>"I swear to you I am serious, fully and deliberately serious. All
faults of the man I can pardon in the player: no fault of the player
can I pardon in the man. Do not set me upon chanting my lament about
the latter: it might have a sharper sound than yours."</p>

<p>The surgeon entered from the cabinet; and, to the question how his
patient was, he answered, with a lively air of complaisance, "Extremely
well, indeed: I hope soon to see him quite recovered." He hastened
through the hall, not waiting Wilhelm's speech, who was preparing to
inquire again with greater importunity about the leathern case. His
anxiety to gain some tidings of his Amazon inspired him with confidence
in Jarno: he disclosed his case to him, and begged his help. "You that
know so many things," said he, "can you not discover this?"</p>

<p>Jarno reflected for a moment; then, turning to his friend, "Be calm,"
said he, "give no one any hint of it: we shall come upon the fair one's
footsteps, never fear. At present I am anxious only for Lothario: the
case is dangerous; the kindliness and comfortable talking of the doctor
tells me so. We should be quit of Lydia, for here she does no good; but
how to set about the task I know not. To-night I am looking for our old
physician: we shall then take further counsel."</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>The physician came: it was the good, old, little doctor whom we
know already, and to whom we were obliged for the communication of the
pious manuscript. First of all, he visited the wounded man, with whose
condition he appeared to be by no means satisfied. He had next a long
interview with Jarno, but they made no allusion to the subject of it
when they came to supper.</p>

<p>Wilhelm saluted him in the kindest manner, and inquired about the
harper. "We have still hopes of bringing round the hapless creature,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
answered the physician. "He formed a dreary item in your limited and
singular way of life," said Jarno. "How has it fared with him? Tell me."</p>

<p>Having satisfied Jarno's curiosity, the physician thus proceeded: "I
have never seen another man so strangely circumstanced. For many years
he has not felt the smallest interest in any thing without him, scarcely
paid the smallest notice to it: wrapped up in himself, he has looked at
nothing but his own hollow, empty Me, which seemed to him like an
immeasurable abyss. It was really touching when he spoke to us of this
mournful state. 'Before me,' cried he, 'I see nothing; behind me nothing
but an endless night, in which I live in the most horrid solitude. There
is no feeling in me but the feeling of my guilt; and this appears but
like a dim, formless spirit, far before me. Yet here there is no height,
no depth, no forwards, no backwards: no words can express this
never-changing state. Often in the agony of this sameness I exclaim with
violence, Forever! Forever! and this dark, incomprehensible word is
clear and plain to the gloom of my condition. No ray of Divinity
illuminates this night: I shed all my tears by myself and for myself.
Nothing is more horrible to me than friendship and love, for they alone
excite in me the wish that the apparitions which surround me might be
real. But these two spectres also have arisen from the abyss to plague
me, and at length to tear from me the precious consciousness of my
existence, unearthly though it be.'</p>

<p>"You should hear him speak," continued the physician, "when in hours
of confidence he thus alleviates his heart. I have listened to him often
with the deepest feelings. When pressed by any thing, and, as it were,
compelled for an instant to confess that a space of time has passed, he
looks astounded, then again refers the alteration to the things about
him, considering it as an appearance of appearances, and so rejecting
the idea of progress in duration. One night he sung a song about his
gray hairs: we all sat round him weeping."</p>

<p>"Oh, get it for me!" cried Wilhelm.</p>

<p>"But have you not discovered any trace of what he calls his crime?"
inquired Jarno: "nor found out the reason of his wearing such a singular
garb; of his conduct at the burning of the house; of his rage against
the child?"</p>

<p>"It is only by conjectures that we can approximate to any knowledge of
his fate: to question him directly contradicts our principle. Observing
easily that he was of the Catholic religion, we thought perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
confession might afford him some assuagement; but he shrinks away with
the strangest gestures every time we try to introduce the priest to
him. However, not to leave your curiosity respecting him entirely
unsatisfied, I may communicate our suppositions on the subject. In his
youth, we think, he must have been a clergyman: hence probably his wish
to keep his beard and long cloak. The joys of love appear to have
remained for many years unknown to him. Late in life, as we conceive,
some aberration with a lady very nearly related to him; then her death,
the consequence of an unlucky creature's birth,&mdash;have altogether
crazed his brain.</p>

<p>"His chief delusion is a fancy that he brings misfortune everywhere
along with him; and that death, to be unwittingly occasioned by a boy,
is constantly impending over him. At first he was afraid of Mignon, not
knowing that she was a girl; then Felix frightened him; and as, with all
his misery, he has a boundless love of life, this may, perhaps, have
been the origin of his aversion to the child."</p>

<p>"What hopes have you of his recovery?" inquired our friend.</p>

<p>"It advances slowly," answered the physician, "yet it does advance.
He continues his appointed occupations: we have now accustomed him to
read the newspapers; he always looks for them with eagerness."</p>

<p>"I am curious about his songs," said Jarno.</p>

<p>"Of these I can engage to get you several," replied the doctor. "Our
parson's eldest son, who frequently writes down his father's sermons,
has, unnoticed by the harper, marked on paper many stanzas of his
singing; out of which some songs have gradually been pieced together."</p>

<p>Next morning Jarno met our friend, and said to him, "We have to ask a
kindness of you. Lydia must, for some time, be removed: her violent,
unreasonable love and passionateness hinder the baron's recovery. His
wound requires rest and calmness, though with his healthy temperament it
is not dangerous. You see how Lydia tortures him with her tempestuous
anxieties, her ungovernable terrors, her never-drying tears;
and&mdash;Enough!" he added with a smile, after pausing for a moment,
"our doctor expressly requires that she must quit us for a while. We
have got her to believe that a lady, one of her most intimate friends,
is at present in the neighborhood, wishing and expecting instantly to
see her. She has been prevailed upon to undertake a journey to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
lawyer's, which is but two leagues off. This man is in the secret: he
will wofully lament that Fräulein Theresa should just have left him
again; he will seem to think she may still be overtaken. Lydia will
hasten after her, and, if you prosper, will be led from place to place.
At last, if she insist on turning back, you must not contradict her; but
the night will help you: the coachman is a cunning knave, and we shall
speak with him before he goes. You are to travel with her in the coach,
to talk to her, and manage the adventure."</p>

<p>"It is a strange and dubious commission that you give me," answered
Wilhelm. "How painful is the sight of true love injured! And am I to be
the instrument of injuring it? I have never cheated any person so; for
it has always seemed to me, that if we once begin deceiving, with a view
to good and useful purposes, we run the risk of carrying it to excess."</p>

<p>"Yet you cannot manage children otherwise," said Jarno.</p>

<p>"With children it may do," said Wilhelm; "for we love them tenderly, and
take an open charge of them. But with our equals, in behalf of whom our
heart is not so sure to call upon us for forbearance, it might
frequently be dangerous. Yet do not think," he added, after pausing for
a moment, "that I purpose to decline the task on this account. Honoring
your judgment as I do, feeling such attachment to your noble friend,
such eagerness to forward his recovery by whatever means, I willingly
forget myself and my opinions. It is not enough that we can risk our
life to serve a friend: in the hour of need, we should also yield him
our convictions. Our dearest passions, our best wishes, we are bound to
sacrifice in helping him. I undertake the charge; though it is easy to
foresee the pain I shall have to suffer, from the tears, from the
despair, of Lydia."</p>

<p>"And, for this, no small reward awaits you," answered Jarno: "Fräulein
Theresa, whom you get acquainted with, is a lady such as you will rarely
see. She puts many a man to shame; I may say, she is a genuine Amazon:
while others are but pretty counterfeits, that wander up and down the
world in that ambiguous dress."</p>

<p>Wilhelm was struck: he almost fancied that in Theresa he would find
his Amazon again; especially as Jarno, whom he importuned to tell him
more, broke off abruptly, and went away.</p>

<p>The new, near hope of once more seeing that beloved and honored being
awoke a thousand feelings in his heart. He now looked upon the task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
which had been given him as the intervention of a special Providence:
the thought that he was minded treacherously to carry off a helpless
girl from the object of her sincerest, warmest love dwelt but a moment
in his mind, as the shadow of a bird flits over the sunshiny earth.</p>

<p>The coach was at the door: Lydia lingered for a moment, as she was about
to mount. "Salute your lord again for me," said she to the old servant:
"tell him that I shall be home before night." Tears were standing in her
eyes as she again looked back when the carriage started. She then turned
round to Wilhelm, made an effort to compose herself, and said, "In
Fräulein Theresa you will find a very interesting person. I wonder what
it is that brings her hither; for, you must know, Lothario and she once
passionately loved each other. In spite of the distance, he often used
to visit her: I was staying with her then; I thought they would have
lived and died for one another. But all at once it went to wreck, no
creature could discover why. He had seen me, and I must confess that I
was envious of Theresa's fortune; that I scarcely hid my love from him;
that, when he suddenly appeared to choose me in her stead, I could not
but accept of him. She behaved to me beyond my wishes, though it almost
seemed as if I had robbed her of this precious lover. But, ah! how many
thousand tears and pains that love of his has cost me! At first we met
only now and then, and by stealth, at some appointed place: but I could
not long endure that kind of life; in his presence only was I happy,
wholly happy! Far from him, my eyes were never dry, my pulse was never
calm. Once he staid away for several days: I was altogether in despair;
I ordered out my carriage, and surprised him here. He received me
tenderly; and, had not this unlucky quarrel happened, I should have led
a heavenly life with him. But, since the time he began to be in danger
and in pain, I shall not say what I have suffered: at this moment I am
bitterly reproaching myself that I could leave him for a single day."</p>

<p>Wilhelm was proceeding to inquire about Theresa, when they reached the
lawyer's house. This gentleman came forward to the coach, lamenting
wofully that Fräulein Theresa was already gone. He invited them to
breakfast; signifying, however, that the lady might be overtaken in
the nearest village. They determined upon following her: the coachman
did not loiter; they had soon passed several villages, and yet come up
with nobody. Lydia now gave orders for returning: the coachman drove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
along, as if he did not understand her. As she insisted with redoubled
vehemence, Wilhelm called to him, and gave the promised token. The
coachman answered that it was not necessary to go back by the same road:
he knew a shorter, and, at the same time, greatly easier one. He turned
aside across a wood, and over large commons. At last, no object they
could recognize appearing, he confessed that unfortunately he had lost
his way; declaring, at the same time, that he would soon get right
again, as he saw a little town before him. Night came on: the coachman
managed so discreetly, that he asked everywhere, and nowhere waited for
an answer. He drove along all night: Lydia never closed an eye; in the
moonshine she was constantly detecting similarities, which as constantly
turned out to be dissimilar. In the morning things around seemed known
to her, and but more strange on that account. The coach drew up before
a neat little country-house: a young lady stepped out, and opened the
carriage-door. Lydia looked at her with a stare of wonder, looked round,
looked at her again, and fainted in the arms of Wilhelm.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>Wilhelm was conducted to a little upper room: the house was new,
as small nearly as it could be, and extremely orderly and clean. In
Theresa, who had welcomed him and Lydia at the coach, he had not found
his Amazon: she was another and an altogether different woman. Handsome,
and but of middle stature, she moved about with great alertness; and it
seemed as if her clear, blue, open eyes let nothing that occurred escape
them.</p>

<p>She entered Wilhelm's room, inquiring if he wanted any thing. "Pardon
me," said she, "for having lodged you in a chamber which the smell of
paint still renders disagreeable: my little dwelling is but just made
ready; you are handselling this room, which is appointed for my guests.
Would that you had come on some more pleasant errand! Poor Lydia is like
to be a dull companion: in other points, also, you will have much to
pardon. My cook has run away from me, at this unseasonable time; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
a serving-man has bruised his hand. The case might happen I had to
manage every thing myself; and if it were so, why, then we should just
put up with it. One is plagued so with nobody as with one's servants:
none of them will serve you, scarcely even serve himself."</p>

<p>She said a good deal more on different matters: in general she seemed
to like speaking. Wilhelm inquired for Lydia,&mdash;if he might not see
her, and endeavor to excuse himself.</p>

<p>"It will have no effect at present," said Theresa: "time excuses, as it
comforts. Words, in both cases, are of little effect. Lydia will not see
you. 'Keep him from my sight,' she cried, when I was leaving her: 'I
could almost despair of human nature. Such an honorable countenance, so
frank a manner, and this secret guile!' Lothario she has quite forgiven:
in a letter to the poor girl, he declares, 'My friends persuaded me, my
friends compelled me!' Among these she reckons you, and she condemns you
with the rest."</p>

<p>"She does me too much honor in so blaming me," said Wilhelm: "I have
no pretension to the friendship of that noble gentleman; on this
occasion, I am but a guiltless instrument. I will not praise what I
have done: it is enough that I could do it. It concerned the health, it
concerned the life, of a man whom I value more than any one I ever knew
before. Oh, what a man is he, Fräulein! and what men are they that live
about him! In their society, I for the first time, I may well say,
carried on a conversation; for the first time, was the inmost sense of
my words returned to me, more rich, more full, more comprehensive, from
another's mouth; what I had been groping for was rendered clear to me;
what I had been thinking I was taught to see. Unfortunately this
enjoyment was disturbed, at first by numerous anxieties and whims, and
then by this unpleasant task. I undertook it with submission; for I
reckoned it my duty, even though I sacrificed my feelings, to comply
with the request of this gifted company of men."</p>

<p>While he spoke, Theresa had been looking at him with a very friendly
air. "Oh, how sweet is it to hear one's own opinion uttered by a
stranger tongue! We are never properly ourselves until another thinks
entirely as we do. My own opinion of Lothario is perfectly the same as
yours: it is not every one that does him justice, and therefore all that
know him better are enthusiastic in esteem of him. The painful sentiment
that mingles with the memory of him in my heart cannot hinder me from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
thinking of him daily." A sigh heaved her bosom as she spoke thus, and a
lovely tear glittered in her right eye. "Think not," continued she,
"that I am so weak, so easy to be moved. It is but the eye that weeps.
There was a little wart upon the under eyelid; they have happily removed
it, but the eye has been weak ever since; the smallest cause brings a
tear into it. Here sat the little wart: you cannot see a vestige of it
now."</p>

<p>He saw no vestige, but he saw into her eye; it was clear as crystal: he
almost imagined he could see to the very bottom of her soul.</p>

<p>"We have now," said she, "pronounced the watchword of our friendship:
let us get entirely acquainted as fast as possible. The history of
every person paints his character. I will tell you what my life has
been: do you, too, place a little trust in me, and let us be united even
when distance parts us. The world is so waste and empty, when we figure
only towns and hills and rivers in it; but to know of some one here
and there whom we accord with, who is living on with us, even in
silence,&mdash;this makes our earthly ball a peopled garden."</p>

<p>She hastened off, engaging soon to take him out to walk. Her presence
had affected him agreeably: he wished to be informed of her relation to
Lothario. He was called: she came to meet him from her room. While they
descended, necessarily one by one, the straight and even steepish
stairs, she said, "All this might have been larger and grander, had I
chosen to accept the offers of your generous friend; but, to continue
worthy of him, I must study to retain the qualities which gave me merit
in his eyes. Where is the steward?" asked she, stepping from the bottom
of the stairs. "You must not think," continued she, "that I am rich
enough to need a steward: the few acres of my own little property I
myself can manage well enough. The steward is my new neighbor's, who
has bought a fine estate beside us, every point of which I am acquainted
with. The good old gentleman is lying ill of gout: his men are strangers
here; I willingly assist in settling them."</p>

<p>They took a walk through fields, meadows, and some orchards. Everywhere
Theresa kept instructing the steward; nothing so minute but she could
give account of it: and Wilhelm had reason to wonder at her knowledge,
her precision, the prompt dexterity with which she suggested means for
ends. She loitered nowhere, always hastened to the leading-points;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
and thus her task was quickly over. "Salute your master," said she, as
she sent away the man: "I mean to visit him as soon as possible, and
wish him a complete recovery. There, now," she added with a smile, as
soon as he was gone, "I might soon be rich: my good neighbor, I believe,
would not be disinclined to offer me his hand."</p>

<p>"The old man with the gout?" cried Wilhelm: "I know not how,
at your years, you could bring yourself to make so desperate a
determination."&mdash;"Nor am I tempted to it!" said Theresa.
"Whoever can administer what he possesses has enough; and to be
wealthy is a burdensome affair, unless you understand it."</p>

<p>Wilhelm testified his admiration at her skill in husbandry concerns.
"Decided inclination, early opportunity, external impulse, and continued
occupation in a useful business," said she, "make many things, which
were at first far harder, possible in life. When you have learned what
causes stimulated me in this pursuit, you will cease to wonder at the
talent you now think strange."</p>

<p>On returning home, she sent him to her little garden. Here he could
scarcely turn himself, so narrow were the walks, so thickly was it sown
and planted. On looking over to the court, he could not help smiling:
the fire-wood was lying there, as accurately sawed, split, and piled, as
if it had been part of the building, and had been intended to continue
permanently there. The tubs and implements, all clean, were standing
in their places: the house was painted white and red; it was really
pleasant to behold. Whatever can be done by handicraft, which knows not
beautiful proportions, but labors for convenience, cheerfulness, and
durability, appeared united in this spot. They served him up dinner in
his own room: he had time enough for meditating. Especially it struck
him, that he should have got acquainted with another person of so
interesting a character, who had been so closely related to Lothario.
"It is just," said he to himself, "that a man so gifted should attract
round him gifted women. How far the influence of manliness and dignity
extends! Would that others did not come so wofully short, compared with
him! Yes, confess thy fear. When thou meetest with thy Amazon, this
woman of women, in spite of all thy hopes and dreaming, thou wilt find
her, in the end, to thy humiliation and thy shame,&mdash;his bride."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>Wilhelm had passed a restless afternoon, not altogether without tedium,
when towards evening his door opened, and a handsome hunter-boy stepped
forward with a bow. "Shall we have a walk?" said the youth; and in the
instant Wilhelm recognized Theresa by her lovely eyes.</p>

<p>"Pardon me this masquerade," said she; "for now, alas! it is nothing
more. But, as I am going to tell you of the time when I so enjoyed the
world, I will recall those days by every method to my fancy. Come along!
Even the place where we have rested so often from our hunts and
promenades shall help me."</p>

<p>They went accordingly. On their way Theresa said to her attendant,
"It is not fair that I alone should speak: you already know enough of
me, I nothing about you. Tell me, in the mean while, something of
yourself, that I may gather courage to submit to you my history and
situation."&mdash;"Alas!" said Wilhelm, "I have nothing to relate but
error on the back of error, deviation following deviation; and I know
none from whom I would more gladly hide my present and my past
embarrassments than from yourself. Your look, the scene you move in,
your whole temperament and manner, prove to me that you have reason to
rejoice in your by-gone life; that you have travelled by a fair, clear
path in constant progress; that you have lost no time; that you have
nothing to reproach yourself withal."</p>

<p>Theresa answered with a smile, "Let us see if you will think so after
you have heard my history." They walked along: among some general
remarks, Theresa asked him, "Are you free?"&mdash;"I think I am," said
he, "and yet I do not wish it."&mdash;"Good!" said she: "that indicates
a complicated story: you also will have something to relate."</p>

<p>Conversing thus, they ascended the hill, and placed themselves beside
a lofty oak, which spread its shade far out on every side. "Here," said
she, "beneath this German tree, will I disclose to you the history of a
German maiden: listen to me patiently.</p>

<p>"My father was a wealthy nobleman of this province,&mdash;a cheerful,
clear-sighted, active, able man; a tender father, an upright friend, an
excellent economist. I knew but one fault in him: he was too compliant
to a wife who did not know his worth. Alas that I should have to say so
of my mother! Her nature was the opposite of his. She was quick and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
changeful; without affection either for her home or for me, her only
child; extravagant, but beautiful, sprightly, full of talent, the
delight of a circle she had gathered round her. Her society, in truth,
was never large; nor did it long continue the same. It consisted
principally of men, for no woman could like to be near her; still less
could <i>she</i> endure the merit or the praise of any woman. I resembled
my father, both in form and disposition. As the duckling, with its first
footsteps, seeks the water; so, from my earliest youth, the kitchen,
the storeroom, the granaries, the fields, were my selected element.
Cleanliness and order in the house seemed, even while I was playing in
it, to be my peculiar instinct, my peculiar object. This tendency gave
my father pleasure; and he directed, step by step, my childish endeavor
into the suitablest employments. On the contrary, my mother did not like
me; and she never for a moment hid it.</p>

<p>"I waxed in stature: with my years increased my turn for occupation, and
my father's love to me. When we were by ourselves, when walking through
the fields, when I was helping to examine his accounts, it was then I
could see how glad he was. While gazing on his eyes, I felt as if I had
been looking in upon myself; for it was in the eyes that I completely
resembled him. But, in the presence of my mother, he lost this energy,
this aspect: he excused me mildly when she blamed me unjustly and
violently; he took my part, not as if he would protect me, but as if he
would extenuate the demerit of my good qualities. To none of her
caprices did he set himself in opposition. She began to be immensely
taken with a passion for the stage: a theatre was soon got up; of men of
all shapes and ages, crowding to display themselves along with her upon
her boards, she had abundance; of women, on the other hand, there was
often a scarcity. Lydia, a pretty girl who had been brought up with me,
and who promised from the first to be extremely beautiful, had to
undertake the secondary parts; the mothers and the aunts were
represented by an ancient chamber-maid; while the leading heroines,
lovers, and shepherdesses of every kind were seized on by my mother. I
cannot tell you how ridiculous it seemed to me to see the people, every
one of whom I knew full well, standing on their scaffold, and
pretending, after they had dressed themselves in other clothes, to pass
for something else than what they were. In my eyes they were never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
any thing but Lydia and my mother, this baron and that secretary,
whether they appeared as counts and princes, or as peasants; and I could
not understand how they meant to make me think that they were sad or
happy, that they were indifferent or in love, liberal or avaricious,
when I well knew the contrary to be the case. Accordingly I very seldom
staid among the audience: I always snuffed their candles, that I might
not be entirely without employment; I prepared the supper; and next
morning, before they rose, I used to have their wardrobe all sorted,
which commonly, the night before, they had left in a chaotic state.</p>

<p>"To my mother this activity appeared quite proper, but her love I could
not gain. She despised me; and I know for certain that she more than
once exclaimed with bitterness, 'If the mother could be as uncertain as
the father, you would scarcely take this housemaid for my daughter!'
Such treatment, I confess, at length entirely estranged me from her: I
viewed her conduct as the conduct of a person unconnected with me; and,
being used to watch our servants like a falcon (for this, be it said in
passing, is the ground of all true housekeeping), the proceedings of my
mother and her friends at the same time naturally forced themselves upon
my observation. It was easy to perceive that she did not look on all men
alike: I gave sharper heed, and soon found out that Lydia was her
confidant, and had herself, by this opportunity, become acquainted with
a passion, which, from her earliest youth, she had so often represented.
I was aware of all their meetings; but I held my tongue, hinting nothing
to my father, whom I was afraid of troubling. At last, however, I was
obliged to speak. Many of their enterprises could not be accomplished
without corrupting the servants. These now began to grow refractory:
they despised my father's regulations, disregarded my commands. The
disorders which arose from this I could not tolerate: I discovered all,
complained of all to my father.</p>

<p>"He listened to me calmly. 'Good girl!' replied he with a smile; 'I know
it all: be quiet, bear it patiently; for it is on thy account alone that
I endure it.'</p>

<p>"I was not quiet: I had not patience. I in secret blamed my father,
for I did not think that any reason should induce him to endure such
things. I called for regularity from all the servants: I was bent on
driving matters to extremity.</p>

<p>"My mother had been rich before her marriage, yet she squandered more
than she had a right to; and this, as I observed, occasioned many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
conferences between my parents. For a long time the evil was not helped,
till at last the passions of my mother brought it to a head.</p>

<p>"Her first gallant became unfaithful in a glaring manner: the house,
the neighborhood, her whole condition, grew offensive to her. She
insisted on removing to a different estate; there she was too solitary:
she insisted on removing to the town; there she felt herself eclipsed
among the crowd. Of much that passed between my father and her I know
nothing: however, he at last determined, under stipulations which I did
not learn, to consent that she should take a journey, which she had been
meditating, to the south of France.</p>

<p>"We were now free; we lived as if in heaven: I do believe my father
could not be a loser, had he purchased her absence by a considerable
sum. All our useless domestics were dismissed, and fortune seemed to
smile on our undertakings: we had some extremely prosperous years; all
things succeeded to our wish. But, alas! this pleasing state was not of
long continuance: altogether unexpectedly my father had a shock of
palsy; it lamed his right side, and deprived him of the proper use of
speech. We had to guess at every thing that he required, for he never
could pronounce the word that he intended. There were times when this
was dreadfully afflicting to us: he would require expressly to be left
alone with me; with earnest gestures, he would signify that every one
should go away; and, when we saw ourselves alone, he could not speak the
word he meant. His impatience mounted to the highest pitch: his
situation touched me to the inmost heart. Thus much seemed certain: he
had something which he wished to tell me, which especially concerned my
interest. What longing did I feel to know it! At other times I could
discover all things in his eyes, but now it was in vain. Even his eyes
no longer spoke. Only this was clear: he wanted nothing, he desired
nothing; he was striving to discover something to me, which unhappily I
did not learn. His malady revisited him: he grew entirely inactive,
incapable of motion; and a short time afterwards he died.</p>

<p>"I know not how it had got rooted in my thoughts, that somewhere he had
hid a treasure which he wished at death to leave me rather than my
mother; I searched about for traces of it while he lived, but I could
meet with none: at his death a seal was put on every thing. I wrote to
my mother, offering to continue in the house, and manage for her:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
she refused, and I was obliged to leave the place. A mutual testament
was now produced: it gave my mother the possession and the use of all;
and I was left, at least throughout her life, dependent on her. It was
now that I conceived I rightly understood my father's beckonings: I
pitied him for having been so weak; he had let himself be forced to do
unjustly to me even after he was dead. Certain of my friends maintained
that it was little better than if he had disinherited me: they called
upon me to attack the will by law, but this I never could resolve on
doing. I reverenced my father's memory too much: I trusted in destiny; I
trusted in myself.</p>

<p>"There was a lady in the neighborhood possessed of large property, with
whom I had always been on good terms: she gladly received me; I engaged
to superintend her household, and erelong the task grew very easy to me.
She lived regularly, she loved order in every thing; and I faithfully
assisted her in struggling with her steward and domestics. I am neither
of a niggardly nor grudging temper; but we women are disposed to insist,
more earnestly than men, that nothing shall be wasted. Embezzlement of
all sorts is intolerable to us: we require that each enjoy exactly in so
far as right entitles him.</p>

<p>"Here I was in my element once more: I mourned my father's death in
silence. My protectress was content with me: one small circumstance
alone disturbed my peace. Lydia returned: my mother had been harsh
enough to cast the poor girl off, after having altogether spoiled her.
Lydia had learned with her mistress to consider passions as her
occupation: she was wont to curb herself in nothing. On her unexpected
re-appearance, the lady whom I lived with took her in: she wished to
help me, but could train herself to nothing.</p>

<p>"About this time the relatives and future heirs of my protectress often
visited the house, to recreate themselves with hunting. Lothario was
frequently among them: it was not long till I had noticed, though
without the smallest reference to myself, how far he was superior to the
rest. He was courteous towards all, and Lydia seemed erelong to have
attracted his attention to her. Constantly engaged in something, I was
seldom with the company: while he was there I did not talk so much as
usual; for, I will confess it, lively conversation, from of old, had
been to me the finest seasoning of existence. With my father I was wont
to talk of every thing that happened. What you do not speak of, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
will seldom accurately think of. No man had I ever heard with greater
pleasure than I did Lothario, when he told us of his travels and
campaigns. The world appeared to lie before him clear and open, as to me
the district was in which I lived and managed. We were not entertained
with marvellous personal adventures, the extravagant half-truths of a
shallow traveller, who is always painting out himself, and not the
country he has undertaken to describe. Lothario did not tell us his
adventures: he led us to the place itself. I have seldom felt so pure a
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"But still higher was my pleasure when I heard him talk, one evening,
about women. The subject happened to be introduced: some ladies of the
neighborhood had come to see us, and were speaking, in the common style,
about the cultivation of the female mind. Our sex, they said, was
treated unjustly: every sort of higher education men insisted on
retaining for themselves; they admitted us to no science, they required
us either to be dolls or family drudges. To all this Lothario said not
much; but, when the party was a little thinned, he gave us his opinion
more explicitly. 'It is very strange,' cried he, 'that men are blamed
for their proceeding here: they have placed woman on the highest station
she is capable of occupying. And where is there any station higher than
the ordering of the house? While the husband has to vex himself with
outward matters, while he has wealth to gather and secure, while perhaps
he takes part in the administration of the state, and everywhere depends
on circumstances; ruling nothing, I may say, while he conceives that he
is ruling much; compelled to be but politic where he would willingly be
reasonable, to dissemble where he would be open, to be false where he
would be upright; while thus, for the sake of an object which he never
reaches, he must every moment sacrifice the first of objects, harmony
with himself,&mdash;a reasonable housewife is actually governing in the
interior of her family; has the comfort and activity of every person in
it to provide for, and make possible. What is the highest happiness of
mortals, if not to execute what we consider right and good,&mdash;to be
really masters of the means conducive to our aims? And where should or
can our nearest aims be, but in the interior of our home? All those
indispensable and still to be renewed supplies, where do we expect, do
we require, to find them, if not in the place where we rise and where
we go to sleep, where kitchen and cellar, and every species of
accommodation for ourselves and ours, is to be always ready? What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
unvarying activity is needed to conduct this constantly recurring series
in unbroken living order! How few are the men to whom it is given to
return regularly like a star, to command their day as they command their
night; to form for themselves their household instruments, to sow and to
reap, to gain and to expand, and to travel round their circle with
perpetual success and peace and love! It is when a woman has attained
this inward mastery, that she truly makes the husband whom she loves, a
master: her attention will acquire all sorts of knowledge; her activity
will turn them all to profit. Thus is she dependent upon no one; and she
procures her husband genuine independence, that which is interior and
domestic: whatever he possesses, he beholds secured; what he earns, well
employed: and thus he can direct his mind to lofty objects; and, if
fortune favors, he may act in the state the same character which so well
becomes his wife at home.'</p>

<p>"He then described to us the kind of wife he wished. I reddened; for he
was describing me, as I looked and lived. I silently enjoyed my triumph;
and the more, as I perceived, from all the circumstances, that he had
not meant me individually, that, indeed, he did not know me. I cannot
recollect a more delightful feeling in my life than this, when a man
whom I so highly valued gave the preference, not to my person, but to my
inmost nature. What a recompense did I consider it! What encouragement
did it afford me!</p>

<p>"So soon as they were gone, my worthy benefactress with a smile observed
to me, 'Pity that men often think and speak of what they will never
execute, else here were a special match, the exact thing for my dear
Theresa!' I made sport of her remark, and added, that indeed men's
understanding gave its vote for household wives, but that their heart
and imagination longed for other qualities; and that we household people
could not stand a rivalry with beautiful and lovely women. This was
spoken for the ear of Lydia; she did not hide from us that Lothario had
made a deep impression on her heart: and, in reality, he seemed at each
new visit to grow more and more attentive to her. She was poor, and not
of rank; she could not think of marriage; but she was unable to resist
the dear delight of charming and of being charmed. I had never loved,
nor did I love at present; but though it was unspeakably agreeable to
see in what light my turn of mind was viewed, how high it was ranked by
such a man, I will confess I still was not altogether satisfied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
I now wished that he should be acquainted with me, and should take a
personal interest in me. This wish arose, without the smallest settled
thought of any thing that could result from it.</p>

<p>"The greatest service I did my benefactress was in bringing into order
the extensive forests which belonged to her. In this precious property,
whose value time and circumstances were continually increasing, matters
still went on according to the old routine,&mdash;without regularity,
without plan, no end to theft and fraud. Many hills were standing bare:
an equal growth was nowhere to be found but in the oldest cuttings. I
personally visited the whole of them, with an experienced forester. I
got the woods correctly measured: I set men to hew, to sow, to plant; in
a short time, all things were in progress. That I might mount more
readily on horseback, and also walk on foot with less obstruction, I had
a suit of men's clothes made for me: I was present in many places, I was
feared in all.</p>

<p>"Hearing that our young friends, with Lothario, were purposing to have
another hunt, it came into my head, for the first time in my life, to
make a figure, or, that I may not do myself injustice, to pass in the
eyes of this noble gentleman for what I was. I put on my men's clothes,
took my gun upon my shoulder, and went forward with our hunters, to
await the party on our marches. They came: Lothario did not know me; a
nephew of the lady introduced me to him as a clever forester, joked
about my youth, and carried on his jesting in my praise, till at last
Lothario recognized me. The nephew seconded my project, as if we had
concocted it together. He circumstantially and gratefully described what
I had done for the estates of his aunt, and consequently for himself.</p>

<p>"Lothario listened with attention: he talked with me, inquired
concerning all particulars of the estates and district. I, of course,
was glad to have such an opportunity of showing him my knowledge: I
stood my ordeal very well; I submitted certain projects of improvement
to him, which he sanctioned, telling me of similar examples, and
strengthening my arguments by the connection which he gave them. My
satisfaction grew more perfect every moment. Happily, however, I merely
wished that he should be acquainted with me, not that he should love me.
We came home; and I observed, more clearly than before, that the
attention he showed Lydia seemed expressive of a secret attachment. I
had reached my object, yet I was not at rest: from that day he showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
a true respect for me, a fine trust in me; in company he usually spoke
to me, asked my opinion, and appeared to be persuaded, that, in
household matters, nothing was unknown to me. His sympathy excited me
extremely: even when the conversation was of general finance and
political economy, he used to lead me to take part in it; and, in his
absence, I endeavored to acquire more knowledge of our province, nay,
of all the empire. The task was easy for me: it was but repeating on the
great scale what I knew so accurately on the small.</p>

<p>"From this period he visited our house oftener. We talked, I may say,
of every thing; yet in some degree our conversation always in the end
grew economical, if even but in a secondary sense. What immense effects
a man, by the continuous application of his powers, his time, his money,
even by means which seem but small, may bring about, was frequently and
largely spoken of.</p>

<p>"I did not withstand the tendency which drew me towards him; and, alas!
I felt too soon how deep, how cordial, how pure and genuine, was my
love, as I believed it more and more apparent that Lydia, and not
myself, was the occasion of these visits. She, at least, was most
vividly persuaded so: she made me her confidant; and this, again, in
some degree, consoled me. For, in truth, what she explained so much to
her advantage, I reckoned nowise of importance: there was not a trace of
any serious lasting union being meditated, but the more distinctly did I
see the wish of the impassioned girl to be his at any price.</p>

<p>"Thus did matters stand, when the lady of the house surprised me with
an unexpected message. 'Lothario,' said she, 'offers you his hand, and
desires through life to have you ever at his side.' She enlarged upon my
qualities, and told me, what I liked sufficiently to hear, that in me
Lothario was persuaded he had found the person whom he had so long been
seeking for.</p>

<p>"The height of happiness was now attained for me: my hand was asked by a
man for whom I had the greatest value, beside whom, and along with whom,
I might expect a full, expanded, free, and profitable employment of my
inborn tendency, of my talent perfected by practice. The sum of my
existence seemed to have enlarged itself into infinitude. I gave my
consent: he himself came, and spoke with me in private; he held out his
hand to me; he looked into my eyes, he clasped me in his arms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
pressed a kiss upon my lips. It was the first and the last. He confided
to me all his circumstances; told me how much his American campaign had
cost him, what debts he had accumulated on his property: that, on this
score, he had in some measure quarrelled with his grand-uncle; that the
worthy gentleman intended to relieve him, though truly in his own
peculiar way, being minded to provide him with a rich wife, whereas,
a man of sense would choose a household wife, at all events; that,
however, by his sister's influence, he hoped his noble relative would be
persuaded. He set before me the condition of his fortune, his plans, his
prospects, and requested my co-operation. Till his uncle should consent,
our promise was to be a secret.</p>

<p>"Scarcely was he gone when Lydia asked me whether he had spoken of her.
I answered no, and tired her with a long detail of economical affairs.
She was restless, out of humor; and his conduct, when he came again, did
not improve her situation.</p>

<p>"But the sun, I see, is bending to the place of rest. Well for you, my
friend! You would otherwise have had to hear this story, which I often
enough go over by myself, in all its most minute particulars. Let me
hasten: we are coming to an epoch on which it is not good to linger.</p>

<p>"By Lothario I was made acquainted with his noble sister; and she, at a
convenient time, contrived to introduce me to the uncle. I gained the
old man: he consented to our wishes, and I returned with happy tidings
to my benefactress. The affair was now no secret in the house: Lydia
heard of it; she thought the thing impossible. When she could no longer
doubt of it, she vanished all at once: we knew not whither she had gone.</p>

<p>"Our marriage-day was coming near: I had often asked him for his
portrait; just as he was going off, I reminded him that he had promised
it. He said, 'You have never given me the case you want to have it
fitted into.' This was true: I had got a present from a female friend,
on which I set no ordinary value. Her name, worked from her own hair,
was fastened on the outer glass: within, there was a vacant piece of
ivory, on which her portrait was to have been painted, when a sudden
death snatched her from me. Lothario's love had cheered me at the time
her death lay heavy on my spirits, and I wished to have the void which
she had left me in her present filled by the picture of my friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>"I ran to my chamber, fetched my jewel-box, and opened it in his
presence. Scarcely had he looked into it, when he noticed a medallion
with the portrait of a lady. He took it in his hand, considered it
attentively, and asked me hastily whose face it was. 'My mother's,'
answered I. 'I could have sworn,' said he, 'that it was the portrait of
a Madame Saint Alban, whom I met some years ago in Switzerland.'&mdash;'
It is the same,' replied I, smiling, 'and so you have unwittingly become
acquainted with your step-mother. Saint Alban is the name my mother has
assumed for travelling with: she passes under it in France at present.'</p>

<p>"'I am the miserablest man alive!' exclaimed he, as he threw the
portrait back into the box, covered his eyes with his hand, and hurried
from the room. He sprang on horseback: I ran to the balcony, and called
out after him; he turned, waved his hand to me, went speedily
away,&mdash;and I have never seen him more."</p>

<p>The sun went down: Theresa gazed with unaverted looks upon the splendor,
and both her fine eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>Theresa spoke not: she laid her hand upon her new friend's hands; he
kissed it with emotion: she dried her tears, and rose. "Let us return,
and see that all is right," said she.</p>

<p>The conversation was not lively by the way. They entered the
garden-door, and noticed Lydia sitting on a bench: she rose, withdrew
before them, and walked in. She had a paper in her hand: two little
girls were by her. "I see," observed Theresa, "she is still carrying her
only comfort, Lothario's letter, with her. He promises that she shall
live with him again so soon as he is well: he begs of her till then to
stay in peace with me. On these words she hangs, with these lines she
solaces herself; but with his friends she is extremely angry."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two children had approached. They courtesied to Theresa,
and gave her an account of all that had occurred while she was absent.
"You see here another part of my employment," said Theresa. "Lothario's
sister and I have made a league: we educate some little ones in common;
such as promise to be lively, serviceable housewives I take charge of,
she of such as show a finer and more quiet talent: it is right to
provide for the happiness of future husbands, both in household and in
intellectual matters. When you become acquainted with my noble friend, a
new era in your life will open. Her beauty, her goodness, make her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
worthy of the reverence of the world." Wilhelm did not venture to
confess, that unhappily the lovely countess was already known to him;
that his transient connection with her would occasion him perpetual
sorrow. He was well pleased that Theresa let the conversation drop, that
some business called for her within. He was now alone: the intelligence
which he had just received of the young and lovely countess being driven
to replace, by deeds of benevolence, her own lost comfort, made him very
sad; he felt, that, with her, it was but a need of self-oblivion, an
attempt to supply, by the hopes of happiness to others, the want of a
cheerful enjoyment of existence in herself. He thought Theresa happy,
since, even in that unexpected melancholy alteration which had taken
place in her prospects, there was no alteration needed in herself. "How
fortunate beyond all others," cried he, "is the man, who, in order to
adjust himself to fate, is not required to cast away his whole preceding
life!"</p>

<p>Theresa came into his room, and begged pardon for disturbing him. "My
whole library," said she, "is in the wall-press here: they are rather
books which I do not throw aside, than which I have taken up. Lydia
wants a pious book: there are one or two of that sort among them.
Persons who throughout the whole twelve months are worldly, think it
necessary to be godly at a time of straits: all moral and religious
matters they regard as physic, which is to be taken with aversion when
they are unwell; in a clergyman, a moralist, they see nothing but a
doctor, whom they cannot soon enough get rid of. Now, I confess, I look
upon religion as a kind of diet, which can only be so when I make a
constant practice of it, when throughout the whole twelve months I never
lose it out of sight."</p>

<p>She searched among the books: she found some edifying works, as they are
called. "It was of my mother," said Theresa, "that poor Lydia learned to
have recourse to books like these. While her gallant continued faithful,
plays and novels were her life: his departure brought religious writings
once more into credit. I, for my share, cannot understand," continued
she, "how men have made themselves believe that God speaks to us through
books and histories. The man to whom the universe does not reveal
directly what relation it has to him, whose heart does not tell him what
he owes to himself and others, that man will scarcely learn it out of
books, which generally do little more than give our errors names."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>She left our friend alone: he passed his evening in examining the little
library; it had, in truth, been gathered quite at random.</p>

<p>Theresa, for the few days Wilhelm spent with her, continued still the
same: she related to him at different times the consequences of that
singular incident with great minuteness. Day and hour, place and name,
were present to her memory: we shall here compress into a word or two so
much of it as will be necessary for the information of our readers.</p>

<p>The reason of Lothario's quick departure was, unhappily, too easy to
explain. He had met Theresa's mother on her journey: her charms
attracted him; she was no niggard of them; and this luckless transitory
aberration came at length to shut him out from being united to a lady
whom nature seemed to have expressly made for him. As for Theresa, she
continued in the pure circle of her duties. They learned that Lydia had
been living in the neighborhood in secret. She was happy that the
marriage, though for unknown causes, had not been completed. She
endeavored to renew her intimacy with Lothario; and more, as it seemed,
out of desperation than affection, by surprise than with consideration,
from tedium than of purpose, he had met her wishes.</p>

<p>Theresa was not uneasy on this account; she waived all further claims;
and, if he had even been her husband, she would probably have had
sufficient spirit to endure a matter of this kind, if it had not
troubled her domestic order: at least, she often used to say, that a
wife who properly conducted her economy should take no umbrage at such
little fancies of her husband, but be always certain that he would
return.</p>

<p>Erelong Theresa's mother had deranged her fortune: the losses fell
upon the daughter, whose share of the effects, in consequence, was
small. The old lady, who had been Theresa's benefactress, died, leaving
her a little property in land, and a handsome sum by way of legacy.
Theresa soon contrived to make herself at home in this new, narrow
circle. Lothario offered her a better property, Jarno endeavoring to
negotiate the business; but she refused it. "I will show," said she, "in
this little, that I deserved to share the great with him; but I keep
this before me, that, should accident embarrass me, on my own account or
that of others, I will betake myself without the smallest hesitation to
my generous friend."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>There is nothing less liable to be concealed and unemployed than
well-directed practical activity. Scarcely had she settled in her little
property, when her acquaintance and advice began to be desired by many
of her neighbors; and the proprietor of the adjacent lands gave her
plainly enough to understand that it depended on herself alone whether
she would take his hand, and be heiress of the greater part of his
estates. She had already mentioned the matter to our friend: she often
jested with him about marriages, suitable and unsuitable.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said she once, "gives a greater loose to people's tongues
than when a marriage happens which they can denominate unsuitable: and
yet the unsuitable are far more common than the suitable; for, alas!
with most marriages, it is not long till things assume a very piteous
look. The confusion of ranks by marriage can be called unsuitable only
when the one party is unable to participate in the manner of existence
which is native, habitual, and which at length grows absolutely
necessary, to the other. The different classes have different ways of
living, which they cannot change or communicate to one another; and this
is the reason why connections such as these, in general, were better not
be formed. Yet exceptions, and exceptions of the happiest kind, are
possible. Thus, too, the marriage of a young woman with a man advanced
in life is generally unsuitable; yet I have seen some such turn out
extremely well. For me, I know but of one kind of marriage that would be
entirely unsuitable,&mdash;that in which I should be called upon to make
a show, and manage ceremonies: I would rather give my hand to the son of
any honest farmer in the neighborhood."</p>

<p>Wilhelm at length made ready for returning. He requested of Theresa to
obtain for him a parting word with Lydia. The impassioned girl at last
consented: he said some kindly things to her, to which she answered,
"The first burst of anguish I have conquered. Lothario will be ever dear
to me: but for those friends of his, I know them; and it grieves me that
they are about him. The abbé, for a whim's sake, could leave a person in
extreme need, or even plunge one into it; the doctor would have all
things go on like clock-work; Jarno has no heart; and you&mdash;at least
no force of character! Just go on: let these three people use you as
their tool; they will have many an execution to commit to you. For a
long time, as I know well, my presence has been hateful to them. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
had not found out their secret, but I had observed that they had one.
Why these bolted rooms, these strange passages? Why can no one ever
reach the central tower? Why did they banish me, whenever they could, to
my own chamber? I will confess, jealousy at first incited me to these
discoveries: I feared some lucky rival might be hid there. I have now
laid aside that suspicion: I am well convinced that Lothario loves me,
that he means honorably by me; but I am quite as well convinced that his
false and artful friends betray him. If you would really do him service,
if you would ever be forgiven for the injury which I have suffered from
you, free him from the hands of these men. But what am I expecting! Give
this letter to him; repeat what it contains,&mdash;that I will love him
forever, that I depend upon his word. Ah!" cried she, rising, and
throwing herself with tears upon Theresa's neck: "he is surrounded by my
foes; they will endeavor to persuade him that I have sacrificed nothing
for his sake. Oh! Lothario may well believe that he is worthy of any
sacrifice, without needing to be grateful for it."</p>

<p>Wilhelm's parting with Theresa was more cheerful: she wished they might
soon meet again. "Me you wholly know," said she: "I alone have talked
while we have been together. It will be your duty, next time, to repay
my candor."</p>

<p>During his return he kept contemplating this new and bright phenomenon
with the liveliest recollection. What confidence had she inspired him
with. He thought of Mignon and Felix, and how happy they might be if
under her direction; then he thought of himself, and felt what pleasure
it would be to live beside a being so entirely serene and clear. As
he approached Lothario's castle, he observed, with more than usual
interest, the central tower and the many passages and side-buildings: he
resolved to question Jarno or the abbé on the subject, by the earliest
opportunity.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p>On arriving at the castle, Wilhelm found its noble owner in the way of
full recovery: the doctor and the abbé had gone off; Jarno alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
was there. It was not long till the patient now and then could ride,
sometimes by himself, sometimes with his friends. His conversation was
at once courteous and earnest, instructive and enlivening: you could
often notice in it traces of a tender sensibility; although he strove to
hide it, and almost seemed to blame it, when, in spite of him, it came
to view.</p>

<p>One evening while at table he was silent, though his look was very
cheerful.</p>

<p>"To-day," said Jarno, "you have met with an adventure; and, no doubt,
you relished it."</p>

<p>"I give you credit for your penetration," said Lothario. "Yes, I have
met with a very pleasing adventure. At another time, perhaps, I should
not have considered it so charming as to-day, when it came upon me so
attractively. Towards night I rode out beyond the river, through the
hamlets, by a path which I had often visited in former years. My bodily
ailings must have reduced me more than I supposed: I felt weak; but, as
my strength was re-awakening, I was, as it were, new-born. All objects
seemed to wear the hues they had in earlier times: all looked graceful,
lovely, charming, as they have not looked to me for many years. I easily
observed that it was mere debility, yet I continued to enjoy it: I rode
softly onwards, and could now conceive how men may grow to like diseases
which attune us to those sweet emotions. You know, perhaps, what used of
old so frequently to lead me that way?"</p>

<p>"If I mistake not," answered Jarno, "it was a little love-concern you
were engaged in with a farmer's daughter."</p>

<p>"It might be called a great one," said Lothario; "for we loved each
other deeply, seriously, and for a long time. To-day, it happened, every
thing combined to represent before me in its liveliest color the
earliest season of our love. The boys were again shaking may-bugs from
the trees: the ashen grove had not grown larger since the day I saw her
first. It was now long since I had met with Margaret. She is married at
a distance; and I had heard by chance that she was come with her
children, some weeks ago, to pay a visit to her father."</p>

<p>"This ride, then, was not altogether accidental?"</p>

<p>"I will not deny," replied Lothario, "that I wished to meet her. On
coming near the house, I saw her father sitting at the door: a child of
probably a year old was standing by him. As I approached, a female gave
a hasty look from an upper window; and a minute afterwards I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
some person tripping down-stairs. I thought surely it was she; and, I
will confess, I was flattering myself that she had recognized me, and
was hastening to meet me. But what was my surprise and disappointment,
when she bounded from the door, seized the child, to whom the horses
had come pretty close, and took it in! It gave me a painful twinge: my
vanity, however, was a little solaced when I thought I saw a tint of
redness on her neck and on the ear, which were uncovered.</p>

<p>"I drew up, and, while speaking with the father, glanced sideways over
all the windows, to observe if she would not appear at some of them; but
no trace of her was visible. Ask I would not, so I rode away. My
displeasure was a little mollified by wonder; though I had not seen the
face, it appeared to me that she was scarcely changed; and ten years are
a pretty space! Nay, she looked even younger, quite as slim, as light of
foot; her neck, if possible, was lovelier than before; her cheeks as
quick at blushing; yet she was the mother of six children, perhaps of
more. This apparition suited the enchantment which surrounded me so
well, that I rode along with feelings grown still younger; and I did not
turn till I was at the forest, when the sun was going down. Strongly as
the falling dew and the prescription of our doctor called upon me to
proceed direct homewards, I could not help again going round by the
farmhouse. I observed a woman walking up and down the garden, which is
fenced by a light hedge. I rode along the footpath to it, and found
myself at no great distance from the person whom I wanted.</p>

<p>"Though the evening sun was glancing in my eyes, I saw that she was busy
with the hedge, which only slightly covered her. I thought I recognized
my mistress. On coming up, I halted, not without a palpitation at the
heart. Some high twigs of wild roses, which a soft air was blowing to
and fro, made her figure indistinct to me. I spoke to her, asked her how
she was. She answered, in an under-tone, 'Quite well.' In the mean time
I perceived a child behind the hedge, engaged in plucking roses; and I
took the opportunity of asking where her other children were. 'It is not
my child,' said she: 'that were rather early!' And at this moment it
happened that the twigs were blown aside, and her face could be
distinctly seen. I knew not what to make of the affair. It was my
mistress, and it was not. Almost younger, almost lovelier, than she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
used to be ten years before. 'Are not you the farmer's daughter?'
inquired I, half confused. 'No,' said she: 'I am her cousin.'</p>

<p>"'You resemble one another wonderfully,' added I.</p>

<p>"'Yes, so says every one that knew her half a score of years ago.'</p>

<p>"I continued putting various questions to her: my mistake was pleasant
to me, even after I had found it out. I could not leave this living
image of by-gone blessedness that stood before me. The child, meanwhile,
had gone away: it had wandered to the pond in search of flowers. She
took her leave, and hastened after it.</p>

<p>"I had now, however, learned that my former love was really in her
father's house. While riding forward, I employed myself in guessing
whether it had been her cousin or she that had secured the child from
harm. I more than once, in thought, repeated all the circumstances of
the incident: I can remember few things that have affected me more
gratefully. But I feel that I am still unwell: we must ask the doctor to
deliver us from the remains of this pathetic humor."</p>

<p>With confidential narratives of pretty love adventures, it often happens
as with ghost stories: when the first is told, the others follow of
themselves.</p>

<p>Our little party, in recalling other times, found numerous passages of
this description. Lothario had the most to tell. Jarno's histories were
all of one peculiar character: what Wilhelm could disclose we already
know. He was apprehensive they might mention his adventure with the
countess; but it was not hinted at, not even in the remotest manner.</p>

<p>"It is true," observed Lothario, "there can scarcely any feeling in the
world be more agreeable than when the heart, after a pause of
indifference, again opens to love for some new object; yet I would
forever have renounced that happiness, had fate been pleased to unite me
with Theresa. We are not always youths: we ought not always to be
children. To the man who knows the world, who understands what he should
do in it, what he should hope from it, nothing can be more desirable
than meeting with a wife who will everywhere co-operate with him, who
will everywhere prepare his way for him; whose diligence takes up what
his must leave; whose occupation spreads itself on every side, while his
must travel forward on its single path. What a heaven had I figured for
myself beside Theresa! Not the heaven of an enthusiastic bliss, but of a
sure life on earth; order in prosperity, courage in adversity, care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
for the smallest, and a spirit capable of comprehending and managing the
greatest. Oh! I saw in her the qualities which, when developed, make
such women as we find in history, whose excellence appears to us far
preferable to that of men,&mdash;this clearness of view, this expertness
in all emergencies, this sureness in details, which brings the whole so
accurately out, although they never seem to think of it. You may well
forgive me," added he, and turning to Wilhelm, with a smile, "that I
forsook Aurelia for Theresa: with the one I could expect a calm and
cheerful life, with the other not a happy hour."</p>

<p>"I will confess," said Wilhelm, "that, in coming hither, I had no small
anger in my heart against you; that I proposed to censure with severity
your conduct to Aurelia."</p>

<p>"It was really censurable," said Lothario: "I should not have exchanged
my friendship for her with the sentiment of love; I should not, in place
of the respect which she deserved, have intruded an attachment she was
neither calculated to excite nor to maintain. Alas! she was not lovely
when she loved,&mdash;the greatest misery that can befall a woman."</p>

<p>"Well, it is past!" said Wilhelm. "We cannot always shun the things we
blame; in spite of us, our feelings and our actions sometimes strangely
swerve from their natural and right direction; yet there are certain
duties which we never should lose sight of. Peace be to the ashes of
our friend! Without censuring ourselves or her, let us with sympathizing
hearts strew flowers upon her grave. But, at the grave in which the
hapless mother sleeps, let me ask why you acknowledge not the
child,&mdash;a son whom any father might rejoice in, and whom you appear
entirely to overlook? With your pure and tender nature, how can you
altogether cast away the instinct of a parent? All this while you have
not spent one syllable upon that precious creature, of whose attractions
I could say so much."</p>

<p>"Whom do you speak of?" asked Lothario: "I do not understand you."</p>

<p>"Of whom but of your son, Aurelia's son, the lovely child, to whose good
fortune there is nothing wanting, but that a tender father should
acknowledge and receive him."</p>

<p>"You mistake, my friend!" exclaimed Lothario; "Aurelia never had a son,
at least by me: I know of no child, or I would with joy acknowledge it;
and, even in the present case, I will gladly look upon the little
creature as a relic of her, and take charge of educating it. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
did she ever give you to believe that the boy was hers, was mine?"</p>

<p>"I cannot recollect that I ever heard a word from her expressly on the
subject; but we took it up so, and I never for a moment doubted it."</p>

<p>"I can give you something like a clew to this perplexity," said Jarno.
"An old woman, whom you must have noticed often, gave Aurelia the child:
she accepted it with passion, hoping to alleviate her sorrows by its
presence; and, in truth, it gave her many a comfortable hour."</p>

<p>This discovery awoke anxieties in Wilhelm: he thought of his dear Mignon
and his beautiful Felix with the liveliest distinctness. He expressed
his wish to remove them both from the state in which they were.</p>

<p>"We shall soon arrange it," said Lothario. "The little girl may be
committed to Theresa: she cannot be in better hands. As for the boy, I
think you should yourself take charge of him: what in us the women leave
uncultivated, children cultivate when we retain them near us."</p>

<p>"But first, I think," said Jarno, "you will once for all renounce the
stage, as you have no talent for it."</p>

<p>Our friend was struck: he had to curb himself, for Jarno's harsh
sentence had not a little wounded his self-love. "If you convince me of
that," replied he, forcing a smile, "you will do me a service, though it
is but a mournful service to rouse one from a pleasing dream."</p>

<p>"Without enlarging on the subject," answered Jarno, "I could merely wish
you would go and fetch the children. The rest will come in course."</p>

<p>"I am ready," answered Wilhelm: "I am restless, and curious to see if I
can get no further knowledge of the boy: I long to see the little girl
who has attached herself so strangely to me."</p>

<p>It was agreed that he should lose no time in setting out. Next day he
had prepared himself: his horse was saddled; he only waited for Lothario
to take leave of him. At the dinner-hour they went as usual to table,
not waiting for the master of the house. He did not come till late, and
then sat down by them.</p>

<p>"I could bet," said Jarno, "that to-day you have again been making trial
of your tenderness of heart: you have not been able to withstand the
curiosity to see your quondam love."</p>

<p>"Guessed!" replied Lothario.</p>

<p>"Let us hear," said Jarno, "how it went: I long to know."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>"I confess," replied Lothario, "the affair lay nearer my heart than it
reasonably ought: so I formed the resolution of again riding out, and
actually seeing the person whose renewed young image had affected me
with such a pleasing illusion. I alighted at some distance from the
house, and sent the horses to a side, that the children, who were
playing at the door, might not be disturbed. I entered the house: by
chance she met me just within the threshold; it was herself; and I
recognized her, notwithstanding the striking change. She had grown
stouter, and seemed to be larger; her gracefulness was shaded by a look
of staidness; her vivacity had passed into a calm reflectiveness. Her
head, which she once bore so airily and freely, drooped a little: slight
furrows had been traced upon her brow.</p>

<p>"She cast down her eyes on seeing me, but no blush announced any inward
movement of the heart. I held out my hand to her, she gave me hers; I
inquired about her husband, he was absent; about her children, she
stepped out and called them; all came in and gathered round her. Nothing
is more charming than to see a mother with a child upon her arm; nothing
is more reverend than a mother among many children. That I might say
something, I asked the name of the youngest. She desired me to walk in
and see her father; I agreed; she introduced me to the room, where every
thing was standing almost just as I had left it; and, what seemed
stranger still, the fair cousin, her living image, was sitting on the
very seat behind the spinning-wheel, where I had found my love so often
in the self-same form. A little girl, the very figure of her mother, had
come after us; and thus I stood in the most curious scene, between the
future and the past, as in a grove of oranges, where within a little
circle flowers and fruits are living, in successive stages of their
growth, beside each other. The cousin went away to fetch us some
refreshment: I gave the woman I had loved so much my hand, and said to
her, 'I feel a true joy in seeing you again.'&mdash;'You are very good
to say so,'<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'answered; she'">answered she;</ins> 'but I also can assure you I feel the highest
joy. How often have I wished to see you once more in my life! I have
wished it in moments which I regarded as my last.' She said this with a
settled voice, without appearance of emotion, with that natural air
which of old delighted me so much. The cousin returned, the father with
her; and I leave you to conceive with what feelings I remained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
and with what I came away."</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p>In his journey to the town, our friend was thinking of the lovely women
whom he knew or had heard of: their curious fortunes, which contained so
little happiness, were present to him with a sad distinctness. "Ah!"
cried he, "poor Mariana! What shall I yet learn of thee? And thou, noble
Amazon, glorious, protecting spirit, to whom I owe so much, whom I
everywhere expect to meet, and nowhere see, in what mournful
circumstances may I find thee, shouldst thou again appear before me!"</p>

<p>On his arrival in the town, there was not one of his acquaintances at
home: he hastened to the theatre; he supposed they would be rehearsing.
Here, however, all was still; the house seemed empty: one little door
alone was open. Passing through it to the stage, he found Aurelia's
ancient serving-maid, employed in sewing linen for a new decoration:
there was barely light enough to let her work. Felix and Mignon were
sitting by her on the floor: they had a book between them; and, while
Mignon read aloud, Felix was repeating all the words, as if he, too,
knew his letters,&mdash;as if he, too, could read.</p>

<p>The children started up, and ran to him: he embraced them with the
tenderest feelings, and brought them closer to the woman. "Art thou the
person," said he to her with an earnest voice, "from whom Aurelia
received this child?" She looked up from her work, and turned her face
to him: he saw her in full light; he started back in terror,&mdash;it
was old Barbara.</p>

<p>"Where is Mariana?" cried he. "Far from here," replied the crone.</p>

<p>"And Felix"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is the son of that unhappy and too true and tender-hearted girl. May
you never feel what you have made us suffer! May the treasure which I
now deliver you make you as happy as he made us wretched!"</p>

<p>She arose to go away: Wilhelm held her fast. "I mean not to
escape you," said she: "let me fetch a paper that will make you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
glad and sorrowful."</p>

<p>She retired, and Wilhelm gazed upon the child with a painful joy: he
durst not reckon him his own. "He is thine!" cried Mignon, "he is
thine!" and passed the child to Wilhelm's knee.</p>

<p>Barbara came back, and handed him a letter. "Here are Mariana's last
words," said she.</p>

<p>"She is dead!" cried he.</p>

<p>"Dead," said the old woman. "I wish to spare you all reproaches."</p>

<p>Astonished and confounded, Wilhelm broke up the letter; but scarcely had
he read the first words of it when a bitter grief took hold of him: he
let the letter fall, and sank upon a seat. Mignon hurried to him, trying
to console him. In the mean time Felix had picked up the letter: he
teased his playmate till she yielded, till she knelt beside him and read
it over. Felix repeated the words, and Wilhelm was compelled to hear
them twice. "If this sheet should ever reach thee, then lament thy
ill-starred friend. Thy love has caused her death. The boy, whose birth
I survive but a few days, is thine: I die faithful to thee, much as
appearances may be against me; with thee I lost every thing that bound
me to life. I die content, for they have assured me that the child is
healthy and will live. Listen to old Barbara; forgive her: farewell, and
forget me not."</p>

<p>What a painful, and yet, to his comfort, half enigmatic letter! Its
contents pierced through his heart, as the children, stuttering and
stammering, pronounced and repeated them.</p>

<p>"That's what has come of it!" said the crone, not waiting till he had
recovered. "Thank Heaven, that, having lost so true a love, you have
still left you so fine a child. Your grief will be unequalled when you
learn how the poor, good girl stood faithful to you to the end, how
miserable she became, and what she sacrificed for your sake."</p>

<p>"Let me drain the cup of sorrow and of joy at once!" cried Wilhelm.
"Convince me, even persuade me, that she was a good girl, that she
deserved respect as well as love: then leave me to my grief for her
irreparable loss."</p>

<p>"It is not yet time," said Barbara: "I have work to do, and I would not
we were seen together. Let it be a secret that Felix is your son: I
should have too much abuse to suffer from the company, for having
formerly deceived them. Mignon will not betray us: she is good and
close."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have known it long, and I said nothing," answered Mignon. "How is it
possible?" cried Barbara. "Whence?" cried Wilhelm.</p>

<p>"The spirit told it me."</p>

<p>"Where? Where?"</p>

<p>"In the vault, when the old man drew his knife, it called to me, 'Bring
his father;' and I thought it must be thou."</p>

<p>"<i>Who</i> called to thee?"</p>

<p>"I know not: in my heart, in my head, I was terrified; I trembled, I
prayed; then it called, and I understood it."</p>

<p>Wilhelm pressed her to his heart, recommended Felix to her, and
retired. He had not observed till then that she was grown much paler and
thinner than when he left her. Madam Melina was the first acquaintance
he met: she received him in the friendliest manner. "Oh that you might
find every thing among us as you wished!" exclaimed she.</p>

<p>"I doubt it," answered Wilhelm: "I do not expect it. Confess that they
have taken all their measures to dispense with me."</p>

<p>"Why would you go away?" replied his friend.</p>

<p>"We cannot soon enough convince ourselves," said he, "how very simply we
may be dispensed with in the world. What important personages we
conceive ourselves to be! We think that it is we alone who animate the
circle we move in; that, in our absence, life, nourishment, and breath
will make a general pause: and, alas! the void which occurs is scarcely
remarked, so soon is it filled up again; nay, it is often but the place,
if not for something better, at least for something more agreeable."</p>

<p>"And the sorrows of our friends we are not to take into account?"</p>

<p>"For our friends, too, it is well, when they soon recover their
composure, when they say each to himself, there where thou art, there
where thou remainest, accomplish what thou canst; be busy, be courteous,
and let the present scene delight thee."</p>

<p>On a narrower inquiry, he found what he had looked for: the opera had
been set up, and was exclusively attracting the attention of the public.
His parts had in the mean while been distributed between Horatio and
Laertes, and both of them were in the habit of eliciting from the
spectators far more liberal applause than he had ever been enabled to
obtain.</p>

<p>Laertes entered: and Madam Melina cried, "Look you here at this
lucky fellow; he is soon to be a capitalist, or Heaven knows what!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
Wilhelm, in embracing him, discovered that his coat was superfine: the
rest of his apparel was simple, but of the very best materials.</p>

<p>"Solve me the riddle!" cried our friend.</p>

<p>"You are still in time to learn," replied Laertes, "that my running to
and fro is now about to be repaid; that a partner in a large commercial
house is turning to advantage my acquirements from books or observation,
and allowing me a share with him. I would give something, could I
purchase back my confidence in women: there is a pretty niece in the
house; and I see well enough, that, if I pleased, I might soon be a made
man."</p>

<p>"You have not heard," said Frau Melina, "that a marriage has already
taken place among ourselves? Serlo is actually wedded to the fair
Elmira: her father would not tolerate their secret correspondence."</p>

<p>They talked in this manner about many things that had occurred while he
was absent: nor was it difficult for him to observe, that, according to
the present temper and constitution of the company, his dismissal had
already taken place.</p>

<p>He impatiently expected Barbara, who had appointed him to wait for her
far in the night. She was to come when all were sleeping: she required
as many preparations as if she had been the youngest maiden gliding in
to her beloved. Meanwhile he read a hundred times the letter she had
given him,&mdash;read with unspeakable delight the word <i>faithful</i> in
the hand of his darling, with horror the announcement of her death,
whose approaches she appeared to view unmoved.</p>

<p>Midnight was past, when something rustled at the half-open door, and
Barbara came in with a little basket. "I am to tell you the story of our
woes," said she: "and I must believe that you will sit unmoved at the
recital; that you are waiting for me but to satisfy your curiosity; that
you will now, as you did formerly, retire within your cold selfishness,
while our hearts are breaking. But look you here! Thus, on that happy
evening, did I bring you the bottle of champagne; thus did I place the
three glasses on the table: and as you then began, with soft nursery
tales, to cozen us and lull us asleep; so will I now with stern truths
instruct you and keep you waking."</p>

<p>Wilhelm knew not what to say, when the old woman, in fact, let go the
cork, and filled the three glasses to the brim.</p>

<p>"Drink!" cried she, having emptied at a draught her foaming glass.
"Drink, ere the spirit of it pass! This third glass shall froth away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
untasted to the memory of my unhappy Mariana. How red were her lips when
she then drank your health! Ah, and now forever pale and cold!"</p>

<p>"Sibyl! Fury!" cried Wilhelm, springing up, and striking the table with
his fist, "what evil spirit possesses thee and drives thee? For what
dost thou take me, that thou thinkest the simplest narrative of
Mariana's death and sorrows will not harrow me enough, but usest these
hellish arts to sharpen my torment? If thy insatiable greediness is
such, that thou must revel at the funeral-table, drink and speak! I have
loathed thee from of old; and I cannot reckon Mariana guiltless while I
even look upon thee, her companion."</p>

<p>"Softly, mein Herr!" replied the crone: "you shall not ruffle me.
Your debts to us are deep and dark: the railing of a debtor does not
anger one. But you are right: the simplest narrative will punish you
sufficiently. Hear, then, the struggle and the victory of Mariana
striving to continue yours."</p>

<p>"Continue mine?" cried Wilhelm: "what fable dost thou mean to tell me?"</p>

<p>"Interrupt me not," said she; "hear me, and then give what belief you
list: to me it is all one. Did you not, the last night you were with us,
find a letter in the room, and take it with you?"</p>

<p>"I found the letter <i>after</i> I had taken it with me: it was lying
in the neckerchief, which, in the warmth of my love, I had seized and
carried off."</p>

<p>"What did the sheet contain?"</p>

<p>"The expectation of an angry lover to be better treated on the next than
he had been on the preceding evening. And that you kept your word to
him, I need not be told; for I saw him with my own eyes gliding from
your house before daybreak."</p>

<p>"You may have seen him; but what occurred within, how sadly Mariana
passed that night, how fretfully I passed it, you are yet to learn. I
will be altogether candid: I will neither hide nor palliate the fact,
that I persuaded Mariana to yield to the solicitations of a certain
Norberg; it was with repugnance that she followed my advice, nay, that
she even heard it. He was rich; he seemed attached: I hoped he would be
constant. Soon after, he was forced to go upon his journey; and Mariana
became acquainted with you. What had I then to abide! What to hinder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
what to undergo! 'Oh!' cried she often, 'hadst thou spared my youth, my
innocence, but four short weeks, I might have found a worthy object of
my love; I had then been worthy of him; and love might have given, with
a quiet conscience, what now I have sold against my will.' She entirely
abandoned herself to her affection for you: I need not ask if you were
happy. Over her understanding I had an unbounded power, for I knew the
means of satisfying all her little inclinations: but over her heart I
had no control; for she never sanctioned what I did for her, what I
counselled her to do, when her heart said nay. It was only to
irresistible necessity that she would yield, but erelong the necessity
appeared to her extremely pressing. In the first period of her youth,
she had never known want; by a complication of misfortunes, her people
lost their fortune; the poor girl had been used to have a number of
conveniences; and upon her young spirit certain principles of honor had
been stamped, which made her restless, without much helping her. She had
not the smallest skill in worldly matters: she was innocent in the
strictest meaning of the word. She had no idea that one could buy
without paying; nothing frightened her more than being in debt: she
always rather liked to give than take. This, and this alone, was what
made it possible that she could be constrained to give herself away, in
order to get rid of various little debts which weighed upon her."</p>

<p>"And couldst not thou," cried Wilhelm, in an angry tone, "have saved
her?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" replied the beldame, "with hunger and need, with sorrow and
privation; but for this I was not disposed."</p>

<p>"Abominable, base procuress! So thou hast sacrificed the hapless
creature! Offered her up to thy throat, to thy insatiable maw!"</p>

<p>"It were better to compose yourself, and cease your reviling," said
the dame. "If you will revile, go to your high, noble houses: there you
will meet with many a mother, full of anxious cares to find out for some
lovely, heavenly maiden the most odious of men, provided he be the
richest. See the poor creature shivering and faltering before her fate,
and nowhere finding consolation, till some more experienced female lets
her understand, that, by marriage, she acquires the right, in future, to
dispose of her heart and person as she pleases."</p>

<p>"Peace!" cried Wilhelm. "Dost thou think that one crime can be the
excuse of another? To thy story, without further observations!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you listen, then, without blaming! Mariana became yours against my
will. In this adventure, at least, I have nothing to reproach myself
with. Norberg returned; he made haste to visit Mariana: she received him
coldly and angrily,&mdash;would not even admit him to a kiss. I employed
all my art in apologizing for her conduct,&mdash;gave him to understand
that her confessor had awakened her conscience: that, so long as
conscientious scruples lasted, one was bound to respect them. I at last
so far succeeded that he went away, I promising to do my utmost for him.
He was rich and rude; but there was a touch of goodness in him, and he
loved Mariana without limit. He promised to be patient, and I labored
with the greatest ardor not to try him too far. With Mariana I had a
stubborn contest: I persuaded her, nay, I may call it forced her, by the
threat of leaving her, to write to Norberg, and invite him for the
night. You came, and by chance picked up his answer in the neckerchief.
Your presence broke my game. For scarcely were you gone, when she anew
began her lamentation: she swore she would not be unfaithful to you; she
was so passionate, so frantic, that I could not help sincerely pitying
her. In the end, I promised, that for this night also I would pacify her
lover, and send him off, under some pretence or other. I entreated her
to go to bed, but she did not seem to trust me: she kept on her clothes,
and at last fell asleep, without undressing, agitated and exhausted with
weeping as she was.</p>

<p>"Norberg came; representing in the blackest hues her conscientious
agonies and her repentance, I endeavored to retain him: he wished to see
her, and I went into the room to prepare her; he followed me, and both
of us at once came forward to her bed. She awoke, sprang wildly up, and
tore herself from our arms: she conjured and begged, she entreated,
threatened, and declared she would not yield. She was improvident enough
to let fall some words about the true state of her affections, which
poor Norberg had to understand in a spiritual sense. At length he left
her, and she locked her door. I kept him long with me, and talked with
him about her situation. I told him that she was with child; that, poor
girl, she should be humored. He was so delighted with his fatherhood,
with his prospect of a boy, that he granted every thing she wished: he
promised rather to set out and travel for a time, than vex his dear,
and injure her by these internal troubles. With such intentions, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
an early hour he glided out; and if you, mein Herr, stood sentry by our
house, there was nothing wanting to your happiness, but to have looked
into the bosom of your rival, whom you thought so favored and so
fortunate, and whose appearance drove you to despair."</p>

<p>"Art thou speaking truth?" said Wilhelm.</p>

<p>"True," said the crone, "as I still hope to drive you to despair."</p>

<p>"Yes: certainly you would despair, if I could rightly paint to you the
following morning. How cheerfully did she awake! how kindly did she call
me in, how warmly thank me, how cordially press me to her bosom! 'Now,'
said she, stepping up to her mirror with a smile, 'can I again take
pleasure in myself, and in my looks, since once more I am my own, am
his, my one beloved friend's. How sweet is it to conquer! How I thank
thee for taking charge of me; for having turned thy prudence and thy
understanding, once, at least, to my advantage! Stand by me, and devise
the means of making me entirely happy!'</p>

<p>"I assented, would not irritate her: I flattered her hopes, and she
caressed me tenderly. If she retired but a moment from the window, I was
made to stand and watch: for you, of course, would pass; for she at
least would see you. Thus did we spend the restless day. At night, at
the accustomed hour, we looked for you with certainty. I was already out
waiting at the staircase: I grew weary, and came in to her again. With
surprise I found her in her military dress: she looked cheerful and
charming beyond what I had ever seen her. 'Do I not deserve,' said she,
'to appear to-night in man's apparel? Have I not struggled bravely? My
dearest shall see me as he saw me for the first time: I will press him
as tenderly and with greater freedom to my heart than then; for am I not
his much more than I was then, when a noble resolution had not freed me?
But,' added she, after pausing for a little, 'I have not yet entirely
won him; I must still risk the uttermost, in order to be worthy, to be
certain of possessing him; I must disclose the whole to him, discover to
him all my state, then leave it to himself to keep or to reject me. This
scene I am preparing for my friend, preparing for myself; and, were his
feelings capable of casting me away, I should then belong again entirely
to myself; my punishment would bring me consolation, I would suffer all
that fate could lay upon me.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>"With such purposes and hopes, mein Herr, this lovely girl expected you:
you came not. Oh! how shall I describe the state of watching and of
hope? I see thee still before me,&mdash;with what love, what heartfelt
love, thou spokest of the man whose cruelty thou hadst not yet
experienced."</p>

<p>"Good, dear Barbara!" cried Wilhelm, springing up, and seizing the old
woman by the hand, "we have had enough of mummery and preparation! Thy
indifferent, thy calm, contented tone betrays thee. Give me back my
Mariana! She is living, she is near at hand. Not in vain didst thou
choose this late, lonely hour to visit me; not in vain hast thou
prepared me by thy most delicious narrative. Where is she? Where hast
thou hidden her? I believe all, I will promise to believe all, so thou
but show her to me, so thou give her to my arms. The shadow of her I
have seen already: let me clasp her once more to my bosom. I will kneel
before her, I will entreat forgiveness; I will congratulate her upon her
victory over herself and thee; I will bring my Felix to her. Come! Where
hast thou concealed her? Leave <i>her</i>, leave me no longer in uncertainty!
Thy object is attained. Where hast thou hidden her? Let me light thee
with this candle, let me once more see her fair and kindly face!"</p>

<p>He had pulled old Barbara from her chair: she stared at him; tears
started into her eyes, wild pangs of grief took hold of her. "What
luckless error," cried she, "leaves you still a moment's hope? Yes, I
have hidden her, but beneath the ground: neither the light of the sun
nor any social taper shall again illuminate her kindly face. Take the
boy Felix to her grave, and say to him, 'There lies thy mother, whom
thy father doomed unheard.' The heart of Mariana beats no longer with
impatience to behold you: not in a neighboring chamber is she waiting
the conclusion of my narrative or fable; the dark chamber has received
her, to which no bridegroom follows, from which none comes to meet a
lover."</p>

<p>She cast herself upon the floor beside a chair, and wept bitterly.
Wilhelm now, for the first time, felt entirely convinced that Mariana
was no more: his emotions it is easy to conceive. The old woman rose: "I
have nothing more to tell you," cried she, and threw a packet on the
table. "Here are some writings that will put your cruelty to shame:
peruse these sheets with unwet eyes, if you can." She glided softly out.
Our friend had not the heart to open the pocket-book that night: he had
himself presented it to Mariana; he knew that she had carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
preserved in it every letter he had sent her. Next morning he prevailed
upon himself: he untied the ribbon; little notes came forward written
with pencil in his own hand, and recalled to him every situation, from
the first day of their graceful acquaintance to the last of their stern
separation. In particular, it was not without acute anguish that he read
a small series of billets which had been addressed to himself, and to
which, as he saw from their tenor, Werner had refused admittance.</p>

<p>"No one of my letters has yet penetrated to thee; my entreaties, my
prayers, have not reached thee; was it thyself that gave these cruel
orders? Shall I never see thee more? Yet again I attempt it: I entreat
thee, come, oh come! I ask not to retain thee, if I might but once more
press thee to my heart."</p>

<p>"When I used to sit beside thee, holding thy hands, looking in thy eyes,
and with the full heart of love and trust to call thee 'Dear, dear good
Wilhelm!' it would please thee so, that I had to repeat it over and
over. I repeat it once again: 'Dear, dear good Wilhelm! Be good as thou
wert: come, and leave me not to perish in my wretchedness.'"</p>

<p>"Thou regardest me as guilty: I am so, but not as thou thinkest. Come,
let me have this single comfort, to be altogether known to thee, let
what will befall me afterwards."</p>

<p>"Not for my sake alone, for thy own too, I beg of thee to come. I feel
the intolerable pains thou art suffering, whilst thou fleest from me.
Come, that our separation may be less cruel! Perhaps I was never worthy
of thee till this moment, when thou art repelling me to boundless woe."</p>

<p>"By all that is holy, by all that can touch a human heart, I call upon
thee! It involves the safety of a soul, it involves a life, two lives,
one of which must ever be dear to thee. This, too, thy suspicion will
discredit: yet I will speak it in the hour of death; the child which I
carry under my heart is thine. Since I began to love thee, no other man
has even pressed my hand. Oh that thy love, that thy uprightness, had
been the companions of my youth!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thou wilt not hear me? I must even be silent. But these letters will
not die: perhaps they will speak to thee, when the shroud is covering my
lips, and the voice of thy repentance cannot reach my ear. Through my
weary life, to the last moment, this will be my only comfort, that,
though I cannot call myself blameless, towards thee I am free from
blame."</p>

<hr class="hr" />

<p>Wilhelm could proceed no farther: he resigned himself entirely to his
sorrow, which became still more afflicting; when, Laertes entering, he
was obliged to hide his feelings. Laertes showed a purse of ducats, and
began to count and reckon them, assuring Wilhelm that there could be
nothing finer in the world than for a man to feel himself on the way to
wealth; that nothing then could trouble or detain him. Wilhelm bethought
him of his dream, and smiled; but at the same time, he remembered with a
shudder, that in his vision Mariana had forsaken him, to follow his
departed father, and that both of them at last had moved about the
garden, hovering in the air like spirits.</p>

<p>Laertes forced him from his meditations: he brought him to a
coffee-house, where, immediately on Wilhelm's entrance, several persons
gathered round him. They were men who had applauded his performance on
the stage: they expressed their joy at meeting him; lamenting that, as
they had heard, he meant to leave the theatre. They spoke so reasonably
and kindly of himself and his acting, of his talent, and their hopes
from it, that Wilhelm, not without emotion, cried at last, "Oh, how
infinitely precious would such sympathy have been to me some months ago!
How instructive, how encouraging! Never had I turned my mind so totally
from the concerns of the stage, never had I gone so far as to despair of
the public."</p>

<p>"So far as this," said an elderly man who now stepped forward, "we
should never go. The public is large: true judgment, true feeling, are
not quite so rare as one believes; only the artist ought not to demand
an unconditional approval of his work. Unconditional approval is always
the least valuable: conditional you gentlemen are not content with. In
life, as in art, I know well, a person must take counsel with himself
when he purposes to do or to produce any thing: but, when it is produced
or done, he must listen with attention to the voices of a number; and,
with a little practice, out of these many votes he will be able to
collect a perfect judgment. The few who could well have saved us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
this trouble for the most part hold their peace."</p>

<p>"This they should not do," said Wilhelm. "I have often heard people, who
themselves kept silence in regard to works of merit, complain and lament
that silence was kept."</p>

<p>"To-day, then, we will speak aloud," cried a young man. "You must dine
with us; and we will try to pay off a little of the debt which we have
owed to you, and sometimes also to our good Aurelia."</p>

<p>This invitation Wilhelm courteously declined: he went to Frau Melina,
whom he wished to speak with on the subject of the children, as he meant
to take them from her.</p>

<p>Old Barbara's secret was not too religiously observed by him. He
betrayed himself so soon as he again beheld the lovely Felix. "Oh my
child!" cried he: "my dear child!" He lifted him, and pressed him to his
heart.</p>

<p>"Father! what hast thou brought for me?" cried the child. Mignon looked
at both, as if she meant to warn them not to blab.</p>

<p>"What new phenomenon is this?" said Frau Melina. They got the children
sent away; and Wilhelm, thinking that he did not owe old Barbara the
strictest secrecy, disclosed the whole affair to Frau Melina. She viewed
him with a smile. "Oh, these credulous men!" exclaimed she. "If any
thing is lying in their path, it is so easy to impose it on them; while
in other cases they will neither look to the right nor left, and can
value nothing which they have not previously impressed with the stamp of
an arbitrary passion!" She sighed, against her will: if our friend had
not been altogether blind, he must have noticed in her conduct an
affection for him which had never been entirely subdued.</p>

<p>He now spoke with her about the children,&mdash;how he purposed to keep
Felix with him, and to place Mignon in the country. Madam Melina, though
sorry at the thought of parting with them, said the plan was good, nay,
absolutely necessary. Felix was becoming wild with her, and Mignon
seemed to need fresh air and other occupation: she was sickly, and was
not yet recovering.</p>

<p>"Let it not mislead you," added Frau Melina, "that I have lightly hinted
doubts about the boy's being really yours. The old woman, it is true,
deserves but little confidence; yet a person who invents untruths for
her advantage, may likewise speak the truth when truths are profitable
to her. Aurelia she had hoodwinked to believe that Felix was Lothario's
son; and it is a property of us women, that we cordially like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
children of our lovers, though we do not know the mothers, or even hate
them from the heart." Felix came jumping in: she pressed him to her with
a tenderness which was not usual to her.</p>

<p>Wilhelm hastened home, and sent for Barbara, who, however, would not
undertake to meet him till the twilight. He received her angrily. "There
is nothing in the world more shameful," said he, "than establishing
one's self on lies and fables. Already thou hast done much mischief with
them; and now, when thy word could decide the fortune of my life, now
must I stand dubious, not venturing to call the child my own, though to
possess him without scruple would form my highest happiness. I cannot
look upon thee, scandalous creature, without hatred and contempt."</p>

<p>"Your conduct, if I speak with candor," said the old woman, "appears to
me intolerable. Even if Felix were not yours, he is the fairest and the
loveliest child in nature: one might purchase him at any price, to have
him always near one. Is he not worthy your acceptance? Do not I deserve
for my care, for the labor I have had with him, a little pension for the
small remainder of my life? Oh, you gentlemen who know no want! It is
well for you to talk of truth and honor; but how the miserable being
whose smallest necessity is unprovided for, who sees in her perplexities
no friend, no help, no counsel, how she is to press through the crowd of
selfish men, and to starve in silence, you are seldom at the trouble to
consider. Did you read Mariana's letters? They are the letters she wrote
to you at that unhappy season. It was in vain that I attempted to
approach you to deliver you these sheets: your savage brother-in-law had
so begirt you, that craft and cunning were of no avail; and at last,
when he began to threaten me and Mariana with imprisonment, I had then
to cease my efforts and renounce all hope. Does not every thing agree
with what I told you? And does not Norberg's letter put the story
altogether out of doubt?"</p>

<p>"What letter?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Did you not find it in the pocket-book?" said Barbara.</p>

<p>"I have not yet read all of them."</p>

<p>"Give me the pocket-book: on that paper every thing depends. Norberg's
luckless billet caused this sorrowful perplexity: another from his hand
may loose the knots, so far as aught may still depend upon unravelling
them." She took a letter from the book: Wilhelm recognized that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
odious writing; he constrained himself, and read,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell me, girl, how hast thou got such power over me? I would not have
believed that a goddess herself could make a sighing lover of me.
Instead of hastening towards me with open arms, thou shrankest back from
me: one might have taken it for aversion. Is it fair that I should spend
the night with old Barbara, sitting on a trunk, and but two doors
between me and my pretty Mariana? It is too bad, I tell thee! I have
promised to allow thee time to think, not to press thee unrelentingly: I
could run mad at every wasted quarter of an hour. Have not I given thee
gifts according to my power? Dost thou still doubt of my love? What wilt
thou have? Do but tell me: thou shalt want for nothing. Would the Devil
had the priest that put such stuff into thy head! Why didst thou go to
such a churl? There are plenty of them that allow young people somewhat.
In short, I tell thee, things must alter: in two days I must have an
answer, for I am to leave the town; and, if thou become not kind and
friendly to me, thou shalt never see me more."....</p>

<p>In this style the letter spun itself to great length; turning, to
Wilhelm's painful satisfaction, still about the same point, and
testifying for the truth of the account which he had got from Barbara.
A second letter clearly proved that Mariana, in the sequel, also had
maintained her purpose; and it was not without heartfelt grief, that,
out of these and other papers, Wilhelm learned the history of the
unlucky girl to the very hour of her death.</p>

<p>Barbara had gradually tamed rude, regardless Norberg, by announcing to
him Mariana's death, and leaving him in the belief that Felix was his
son. Once or twice he had sent her money, which, however, she retained
for herself; having talked Aurelia into taking charge of the child. But,
unhappily, this secret source of riches did not long endure. Norberg, by
a life of riot, had impaired his fortune; and, by repeated love-affairs,
his heart was rendered callous to his supposed first-born.</p>

<p>Probable as all this seemed, beautifully as it all agreed, Wilhelm did
not venture to give way to joy. He still appeared to dread a present
coming from his evil Genius.</p>

<p>"Your jealous fears," said Barbara, who guessed his mood of mind, "time
alone can cure. Look upon the child as a stranger one; take stricter
heed of him on that account; observe his gifts, his temper, his
capacities; and if you do not, by and by, discover in him the exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
resemblance of yourself, your eyes must certainly be bad. Of this I can
assure you,&mdash;were I a man, no one should foist a child on me; but
it is a happiness for women, that, in these cases, men are not so quick
of sight."</p>

<p>These things over, Wilhelm and Barbara parted: he was to take Felix with
him; she, to carry Mignon to Theresa, and afterwards to live in any
place she pleased, upon a small annuity which he engaged to settle on
her.</p>

<p>He sent for Mignon, to prepare her for the new arrangement. "Master,"
said she, "keep me with thee: it will do me good, and do me ill."</p>

<p>He told her, that, as she was now grown up, there should be something
further done for her instruction. "I am sufficiently instructed,"
answered she, "to love and grieve."</p>

<p>He directed her attention to her health, and showed that she required
continuous care, and the direction of a good physician. "Why care for
me," said she, "when there are so many things to care for?"</p>

<p>After he had labored greatly to persuade her that he could not take her
with him, that he would conduct her to a place where he might often see
her, she appeared as if she had not heard a word of it. "Thou wishest
not to have me with thee," said she. "Perhaps it is better: send me to
the old harper; the poor man is lonely where he is."</p>

<p>Wilhelm tried to show her that the old man was in comfortable
circumstances. "Every hour I long for him," replied the child.</p>

<p>"I did not see," said Wilhelm, "that thou wert so fond of him when he
was living with us."</p>

<p>"I was frightened for him when he was awake; I could not bear his eyes:
but, when he was asleep, I liked so well to sit by him! I used to chase
the flies from him: I could not look at him enough. Oh! he has stood by
me in fearful moments: none knows how much I owe him. Had I known the
road, I should have run away to him already."</p>

<p>Wilhelm set the circumstances in detail before her: he said that she had
always been a reasonable child, and that, on this occasion also, she
might do as she desired. "Reason is cruel," said she; "the heart is
better: I will go as thou requirest, only leave me Felix."</p>

<p>After much discussion her opinion was not altered; and Wilhelm at last
resolved on giving Barbara both the children, and sending them together
to Theresa. This was the easier for him, as he still feared to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
upon the lovely Felix as his son. He would take him on his arm, and
carry him about: the child delighted to be held before the glass;
Wilhelm also liked, though unavowedly, to hold him there, and seek
resemblances between their faces. If for a moment any striking
similarity appeared between them, he would press the boy in his arms;
and then, at once affrighted by the thought that he might be mistaken,
he would set him down, and let him run away. "Oh," cried he, "if I were
to appropriate this priceless treasure, and it were then to be snatched
from me, I should be the most unhappy man on earth!"</p>

<p>The children had been sent away; and Wilhelm was about to take a formal
leave of the theatre, when he felt that in reality he had already taken
leave, and needed but to go. Mariana was no more: his two guardian
spirits had departed, and his thoughts hied after them. The fair boy
hovered like a beautiful uncertain vision in the eyes of his
imagination: he saw him, at Theresa's hand, running through the fields
and woods, forming his mind and person in the free air, beside a free
and cheerful foster-mother. Theresa had become far dearer to him since
he figured her in company with Felix. Even while sitting in the theatre,
he thought of her with smiles; he was almost in her own case: the stage
could now produce no more illusion in him.</p>

<p>Serlo and Melina were excessively polite to him, when they observed
that he was making no pretensions to his former place. A portion of the
public wished to see him act again: this he could not accede to; nor in
the company did any one desire it, saving Frau Melina.</p>

<p>Of this friend he now took leave; he was moved at parting with her: he
exclaimed, "Why do we presume to promise any thing depending on an
unknown future? The most slight engagement we have not power to keep,
far less a purpose of importance. I feel ashamed in recollecting what I
promised to you all, in that unhappy night, when we were lying
plundered, sick, and wounded, crammed into a miserable tavern. How did
misfortune elevate my courage! what a treasure did I think I had found
in my good wishes! And of all this not a jot has taken effect! I leave
you as your debtor; and my comfort is, that our people prized my promise
at its actual worth, and never more took notice of it."</p>

<p>"Be not unjust to yourself," said Frau Melina: "if no one acknowledges
what you have done for us, I at least will not forget it. Our whole
condition had been different, if you had not been with us. But it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
with our purposes as with our wishes. They seem no longer what they
were, when they have been accomplished, been fulfilled; and we think we
have done, have wished for, nothing."</p>

<p>"You shall not, by your friendly statement," answered Wilhelm, "put my
conscience to peace. I shall always look upon myself as in your debt."</p>

<p>"Nay, perhaps you are so," said Madam Melina, "but not in the manner you
suppose. We reckon it a shame to fail in the fulfilment of a promise we
have uttered with the voice. O my friend! a worthy person by his very
presence promises us much. The confidence he elicits, the inclination he
inspires, the hopes he awakens, are unbounded: he is and continues in
our debt, although he does not know it. Fare you well! If our external
circumstances have been happily repaired by your direction, in my mind
there is, by your departure, produced a void which will not be filled up
again so easily."</p>

<p>Before leaving the city, Wilhelm wrote a copious sheet to Werner. He had
before exchanged some letters; but, not being able to agree, they had at
length ceased to write. Now, however, Wilhelm had again approximated to
his brother: he was just about to do what Werner had so earnestly
desired. He could say, "I am abandoning the stage: I mean to join myself
with men whose intercourse, in every sense, must lead me to a sure and
suitable activity." He inquired about his property; and it now seemed
strange to him, that he had never, for so long a time, disturbed himself
about it. He knew not that it is the manner of all persons who attach
importance to their inward cultivation altogether to neglect their
outward circumstances. This had been Wilhelm's case: he now for the
first time seemed to notice, that, to work effectively, he stood in need
of outward means. He entered on his journey, this time, in a temper
altogether different from that of last; the prospects he had in view
were charming; he hoped to meet with something cheerful by the way.

<hr class="hr2" />
<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p>On returning to Lothario's castle, Wilhelm found that changes had
occurred. Jarno met him with the tidings, that, Lothario's uncle being
dead, the baron had himself set out to take possession of the heritage.
"You come in time," said he, "to help the abbé and me. Lothario has
commissioned us to purchase some extensive properties of land in this
quarter: he has long contemplated the bargain, and we have now got cash
and credit just in season. The only point which made us hesitate was,
that a distant trading-house had also views upon the same estates: at
length we have determined to make common cause with it, as otherwise we
might outbid each other without need or reason. The trader seems to be a
prudent man. At present we are making estimates and calculations: we
must also settle economically how the lands are to be shared, so that
each of us may have a fine estate." The papers were submitted to our
friend: the fields, meadows, houses, were inspected; and, though Jarno
and the abbé seemed to understand the matter fully, Wilhelm could not
help desiring that Theresa had been with them.</p>

<p>In these labors several days were spent, and Wilhelm had scarcely time
to tell his friends of his adventures and his dubious fatherhood. This
incident, to him so interesting, they treated with indifference and
levity.</p>

<p>He had noticed, that they frequently in confidential conversation, while
at table or in walks, would suddenly stop short, and give their words
another application; thereby showing, at least, that they had on the
anvil many things which were concealed from him. He bethought him of
what Lydia had said; and he put the greater faith in it, as one entire
division of the castle had always been inaccessible to him. The way to
certain galleries, particularly to the ancient tower, with which
externally he was so well acquainted, he had often sought, and hitherto
in vain.</p>

<p>One evening Jarno said to him, "We can now consider you as ours, with
such security, that it were unjust if we did not introduce you deeper
into our mysteries. It is right that a man, when he first enters upon
life, should think highly of himself, should determine to attain many
eminent distinctions, should endeavor to make all things possible; but,
when his education has proceeded to a certain pitch, it is advantageous
for him, that he learn to lose himself among a mass of men, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
learn to live for the sake of others, and to forget himself in an
activity prescribed by duty. It is then that he first becomes acquainted
with himself, for it is conduct alone that compares us with others. You
shall soon see what a curious little world is at your very hand, and how
well you are known in it. To-morrow morning before sunrise be dressed
and ready."</p>

<p>Jarno came at the appointed hour: he led our friend through certain
known and unknown chambers of the castle, then through several
galleries; till at last they reached a large old door, strongly framed
with iron. Jarno knocked: the door went up a little, so as to admit one
person. Jarno shoved in our friend, but did not follow him. Wilhelm
found himself in an obscure and narrow stand: all was dark around him;
and, when he tried to go a step forward, he found himself hemmed in. A
voice not altogether strange to him cried, "Enter!" and he now
discovered that the sides of the place where he was were merely hung
with tapestry, through which a feeble light glimmered in to him.
"Enter!" cried the voice again: he raised the tapestry, and entered.</p>

<p>The hall in which he now stood appeared to have at one time been a
chapel: instead of the altar, he observed a large table raised some
steps above the floor, and covered with a green cloth hanging over it.
On the top of this, a drawn curtain seemed as if it hid a picture; on
the sides were spaces beautifully worked, and covered in with fine
wire-netting, like the shelves of a library; only here, instead of
books, a multitude of rolls had been inserted. Nobody was in the hall:
the rising sun shone through the window, right on Wilhelm, and kindly
saluted him as he came in.</p>

<p>"Be seated!" cried a voice, which seemed to issue from the altar.
Wilhelm placed himself in a small arm-chair, which stood against the
tapestry where he had entered. There was no seat but this in the room:
Wilhelm had to be content with it, though the morning radiance dazzled
him; the chair stood fast, he could only keep his hand before his eyes.</p>

<p>But now the curtain, which hung down above the altar, went asunder with
a gentle rustling, and showed, within a picture-frame, a dark, empty
aperture. A man stepped forward at it, in a common dress, saluted the
astonished looker-on, and said to him, "Do you not recognize me? Among
the many things which you would like to know, do you feel no curiosity
to learn where your grandfather's collection of pictures and statues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
are at present? Have you forgot the painting which you once so much
delighted in? Where, think you, is the sick king's son now languishing?"
Wilhelm, without difficulty, recognized the stranger, whom, in that
important night, he had conversed with at the inn. "Perhaps," continued
his interrogator, "we should now be less at variance in regard to
destiny and character."</p>

<p>Wilhelm was about to answer, when the curtain quickly flew together.
"Strange!" said Wilhelm to himself: "can chance occurrences have a
connection? Is what we call Destiny but Chance? Where <i>is</i> my
grandfather's collection? and why am I reminded of it in these solemn
moments?"</p>

<p>He had not leisure to pursue his thoughts: the curtain once more parted;
and a person stood before him, whom he instantly perceived to be the
country clergyman that had attended him and his companions on that
pleasure-sail of theirs. He had a resemblance to the abbé, though he
seemed to be a different person. With a cheerful countenance, in a tone
of dignity, he said, "To guard from error is not the instructor's duty,
but to lead the erring pupil; nay, to let him quaff his error in deep,
satiating draughts, this is the instructor's wisdom. He who only tastes
his error, will long dwell with it, will take delight in it as in a
singular felicity; while he who drains it to the dregs will, if he be
not crazy, find it out." The curtain closed again, and Wilhelm had a
little time to think. "What error can he mean," said he within himself,
"but the error which has clung to me through my whole life,&mdash;that I
sought for cultivation where it was not to be found; that I fancied I
could form a talent in me, while without the smallest gift for it?"</p>

<p>The curtain dashed asunder faster than before: an officer advanced, and
said in passing, "Learn to know the men who may be trusted!" The curtain
closed; and Wilhelm did not long consider, till he found this officer to
be the one who had embraced him in the count's park, and had caused his
taking Jarno for a crimp. How that stranger had come hither, who he was,
were riddles to our friend. "If so many men," cried he, "took interest
in thee, know thy way of life, and how it should be carried on, why did
they not conduct thee with greater strictness, with greater seriousness?
Why did they favor thy silly sports, instead of drawing thee away from
them?"</p>

<p>"Dispute not with us!" cried a voice. "Thou art saved, thou art on the
way to the goal. None of thy follies wilt thou repent; none wilt thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
wish to repeat; no luckier destiny can be allotted to a man." The
curtain went asunder, and in full armor stood the old king of Denmark in
the space. "I am thy father's spirit," said the figure; "and I depart in
comfort since my wishes for thee are accomplished, in a higher sense
than I myself contemplated. Steep regions cannot be surmounted save by
winding paths: on the plain, straight roads conduct from place to place.
Farewell, and think of me when thou enjoyest what I have provided for
thee."</p>

<p>Wilhelm was exceedingly amazed and struck: he thought it was his
father's voice; and yet in truth it was not: the present and the past
alike confounded and perplexed him.</p>

<p>He had not meditated long when the abbé came to view, and placed himself
behind the green table. "Come hither!" cried he to his marvelling
friend. He went, and mounted up the steps. On the green cloth lay a
little roll. "Here is your indenture," said the abbé: "take it to heart;
it is of weighty import." Wilhelm lifted, opened it, and read:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><b>INDENTURE.</b></p>

<p>Art is long, life short, judgment difficult, opportunity transient. To
act is easy, to think is hard; to act according to our thought is
troublesome. Every beginning is cheerful: the threshold is the place of
expectation. The boy stands astonished, his impressions guide him: he
learns sportfully, seriousness comes on him by surprise. Imitation is
born with us: what should be imitated is not easy to discover. The
excellent is rarely found, more rarely valued. The height charms us, the
steps to it do not: with the summit in our eye, we love to walk along
the plain. It is but a part of art that can be taught: the artist needs
it all. Who knows it half, speaks much, and is always wrong: who knows
it wholly, inclines to act, and speaks seldom or late. The former have
no secrets and no force: the instruction they can give is like baked
bread, savory and satisfying for a single day; but flour cannot be sown,
and seed-corn ought not to be ground. Words are good, but they are not
the best. The best is not to be explained by words. The spirit in which
we act is the highest matter. Action can be understood and again
represented by the spirit alone. No one knows what he is doing while he
acts aright, but of what is wrong we are always conscious. Whoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
works with symbols only is a pedant, a hypocrite, or a bungler. There
are many such, and they like to be together. Their babbling detains the
scholar: their obstinate mediocrity vexes even the best. The instruction
which the true artist gives us opens the mind; for, where words fail
him, deeds speak. The true scholar learns from the known to unfold the
unknown, and approaches more and more to being a master.</p>

<p>"Enough!" cried the abbé: "the rest in due time. Now look round you
among these cases."</p>

<p>Wilhelm went, and read the titles of the rolls. With astonishment he
found, "Lothario's Apprenticeship," "Jarno's Apprenticeship," and his
own Apprenticeship placed there, with many others whose names he did not
know.</p>

<p>"May I hope to cast a look into these rolls?"</p>

<p>"In this chamber there is now nothing hid from you."</p>

<p>"May I put a question?"</p>

<p>"Without scruple; and you may expect a positive reply, if it concerns a
matter which is nearest your heart, and ought to be so."</p>

<p>"Good, then! Ye marvellous sages, whose sight has pierced so many
secrets, can you tell me whether Felix is in truth my son?"</p>

<p>"Hail to you for this question!" cried the abbé, clapping hands for joy.
"Felix is your son! By the holiest that lies hid among us, I swear to
you Felix is your son; nor, in our opinion, was the mother that is gone
unworthy of you. Receive the lovely child from our hands: turn round,
and venture to be happy."</p>

<p>Wilhelm heard a noise behind him: he turned round, and saw a child's
face peeping archly through the tapestry at the end of the room; it was
Felix. The boy playfully hid himself so soon as he was noticed. "Come
forward!" cried the abbé: he came running; his father rushed towards
him, took him in his arms, and pressed him to his heart. "Yes! I feel
it," cried he, "thou art mine! What a gift of Heaven have I to thank my
friends for! Whence or how comest thou, my child, at this important
moment?"</p>

<p>"Ask not," said the abbé. "Hail to thee, young man! Thy Apprenticeship
is done: Nature has pronounced thee free."</p>

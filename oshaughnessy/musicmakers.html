<h1>Ode</h1>
<h2>by Arthur O'Shaughnessy (1874)</h2>
<p>
We are the music-makers,<br/>
And we are the dreamers of dreams,<br/>
Wandering by lone sea-breakers.<br/>
And sitting by desolate streams;<br/>
World-losers and world-forsakers,<br/>
On whom the pale moon gleams:<br/>
Yet we are the movers and shakers<br/>
Of the world forever, it seems.
</p>
<p>
With wonderful deathless ditties<br/>
We build up the world's great cities,<br/>
And out of a fabulous story<br/>
We fashion an empire's glory:<br/>
One man with a dream, at pleasure.<br/>
Shall go forth and conquer a crown;<br/>
And three with a new song's measure<br/>
Can trample a kingdom down.
</p>
<p>
We, in the ages lying<br/>
In the buried past of the earth,<br/>
Built Nineveh with our sighing,<br/>
And Babel itself in our mirth;<br/>
And o'erthrew them with prophesying<br/>
To the Old of the New World's worth;<br/>
For each age is a dream that is dying,<br/>
Or one that is coming to birth.
</p>
<p>
A breath of our inspiration<br/>
Is the life of each generation;<br/>
A wondrous thing of our dreaming,<br/>
Unearthly, impossible seeming &mdash;<br/>
The soldier, the king, and the peasant<br/>
Are working together in one,<br/>
Till our dream shall become their present,<br/>
And their work in the world be done.
</p>
<p>
They had no vision amazing<br/>
Of the goodly house they are raising;<br/>
They had no divine foreshowing<br/>
Of the land to which they are going:<br/>
But on one man's soul it hath broken,<br/>
A light that doth not depart;<br/>
And his look, or a word he hath spoken,<br/>
Wrought flame in another man's heart.
</p>
<p>
And therefore to-day is thrilling<br/>
With a past day's late fulfilling;<br/>
And the multitudes are enlisted<br/>
In the faith that their fathers resisted.<br/>
And, scorning the dream of to-morrow.<br/>
Are bringing to pass, as they may,<br/>
In the world, for its joy or its sorrow,<br/>
The dream that was scorned yesterday.
</p>
<p>
But we, with our dreaming and singing,<br/>
Ceaseless and sorrowless we!<br/>
The glory about us clinging<br/>
Of the glorious futures we see,<br/>
Our souls with high music ringing:<br/>
O men! it must ever be<br/>
That we dwell, in our dreaming and singing,<br/>
A little apart from ye.
</p>
<p>
For we are afar with the dawning<br/>
And the suns that are not yet high,<br/>
And out of the infinite morning<br/>
Intrepid you hear us cry &mdash;<br/>
How, spite of your human scorning,<br/>
Once more God's future draws nigh,<br/>
And already goes forth the warning<br/>
That ye of the past must die.
</p>
<p>
Great hail! we cry to the comers<br/>
From the dazzling unknown shore;<br/>
Bring us hither your sun and your summers,<br/>
And renew our world as of yore;<br/>
You shall teach us your song's new numbers;<br/>
And things that we dreamed not before:<br/>
Yea, in spite of a dreamer who slumbers,<br/>
And a singer who sings no more.

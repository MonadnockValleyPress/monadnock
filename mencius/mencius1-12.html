<h1>The Mencius</h1>
<h2>Book 1</h2>
<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<h4>True royal government will assuredly raise to the supreme dignity, and neither greed of wealth, nor love of woman, need interfere with its exercise.</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>The king Hsüan of Ch'î said, 'People all tell me to pull down and remove the Hall of Distinction. Shall I pull it down, or stop the movement for that object?'</p></li>
<li><p>Mencius replied, 'The Hall of Distinction is a Hall appropriate to the sovereigns. If your Majesty wishes to practise the true royal government, then do not pull it down.'</p></li>
<li><p>The king said, 'May I hear from you what the true royal government is?' 'Formerly,' was the reply, 'king Wan's government of Ch'î was as follows:-- The husbandmen cultivated for the government one-ninth of the land; the descendants of officers were salaried; at the passes and in the markets, strangers were inspected, but goods were not taxed: there were no prohibitions respecting the ponds and weirs; the wives and children of criminals were not involved in their guilt. There were the old and wifeless, or widowers; the old and husbandless, or widows; the old and childless, or solitaries ; the young and fatherless, or orphans:-- these four classes are the most destitute of the people, and have none to whom they can tell their wants, and king Wan, in the institution of his government with its benevolent action, made them the first objects of his regard, as it is said in the Book of Poetry,
<blockquote>
"The rich may get through life well;<br/>
But alas! for the miserable and solitary!"'
</blockquote>
</p></li>
<li><p>The king said, 'O excellent words!' Mencius said, 'Since your Majesty deems them excellent, why do you not practise them?' 'I have an infirmity,' said the king; 'I am fond of wealth.' The reply was, 'Formerly, Kung-lîu was fond of wealth. It is said in the Book of Poetry,
<blockquote>
"He reared his ricks, and filled his granaries,<br/>
He tied up dried provisions and grain,<br/>
In bottomless bags, and sacks,<br/>
That he might gather his people together, and glorify his State.<br/>
With bows and arrows all-displayed,<br/>
With shields, and spears, and battle-axes, large and small,<br/>
He commenced his march."
</blockquote>
In this way those who remained in their old seat had their ricks and granaries, and those who marched had their bags of provisions. It was not till after this that he thought he could begin his march. If your Majesty loves wealth, give the people power to gratify the same feeling, and what difficulty will there be in your attaining the royal sway?'</p></li>
<li><p>The king said, 'I have an infirmity; I am fond of beauty.' The reply was, 'Formerly, king T'âi was fond of beauty, and loved his wife. It is said in the Book of Poetry,
<blockquote>
"Kû-kung T'an-fû<br/>
Came in the morning, galloping his horse,<br/>
By the banks of the western waters,<br/>
As far as the foot of Ch'î hill,<br/>
Along with the lady of Chiang;<br/>
They came and together chose the site for their settlement."
</blockquote>
At that time, in the seclusion of the house, there were no dissatisfied women, and abroad, there were no unmarried men. If your Majesty loves beauty, let the people be able to gratify the same feeling, and what difficulty will there be in your attaining the royal sway?'</p></li>

<h1>The Mencius</h1>
<h2>Book 1</h2>
<h3>Chapter 19</h3>
<h4>The affections of the people can only be secured through a benevolent government. As they are dealt with by their superiors, so will they deal by them.</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>There had been a brush between Tsâu and Lû, when the duke Mû asked Mencius, saying,'Of my officers there were killed thirty-three men, and none of the people would die in their defence. Though I sentenced them to death for their conduct, it is impossible to put such a multitude to death. If I do not put them to death, then there is the crime unpunished of their looking angrily on at the death of their officers, and not saving them. How is the exigency of the case to be met?'</p></li>
<li><p>Mencius replied, 'In calamitous years and years of famine, the old and weak of your people, who have been found lying in the ditches and water-channels, and the able-bodied who have been scattered about to the four quarters, have amounted to several thousands. All the while, your granaries, O prince, have been stored with grain, and your treasuries and arsenals have been full, and not one of your officers has told you of the distress. Thus negligent have the superiors in your State been, and cruel to their inferiors. The philosopher Tsang said, "Beware, beware. What proceeds from you, will return to you again." Now at length the people have paid back the conduct of their officers to them. Do not you, O prince, blame them.</p></li>
<li><p>'If you will put in practice a benevolent government, this people will love you and all above them, and will die for their officers.'</p></li>

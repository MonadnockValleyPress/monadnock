<h1>The Mencius</h1>
<h2>Book 1</h2>
<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<h4>How friendly intercourse with neighboring kingdoms may be maintained, and the love of valour made subservient to the good of the people, and the glory of the prince.</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>The king Hsüan of Ch'î asked, saying, 'Is there any way to regulate one's maintenance of intercourse with neighbouring kingdoms?' Mencius replied, 'There is. But it requires a perfectly virtuous prince to be able, with a great country, to serve a small one,-- as, for instance, T'ang served Ko, and king Wan served the Kwan barbarians. And it requires a wise prince to be able, with a small country, to serve a large one,-- as the king T'âi served the Hsün-yü, and Kâu-ch'ien served Wû.</p></li>
<li><p>'He who with a areat State serves a small one, delights in Heaven. He who with a small State serves a large one, stands in awe of Heaven. He who delights in Heaven, will affect with his love and protection the whole kingdom. He who stands in awe of Heaven, will affect with his love and protection his own kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p>'It is said in the Book of Poetry, "I fear the Majesty of Heaven, and will thus preserve its favouring decree."'</p></li>
<li><p>The king said,'A great saying! But I have an infirmity;-- I love valour.'</p></li>
<li><p>I beg your Majesty,' was the reply, 'not to love small valour. If a man brandishes his sword, looks fiercely, and says, "How dare he withstand me?"-- this is the valour of a common man, who can be the opponent only of a single individual. I beg your Majesty to greaten it.</p></li>
<li><p>'It is said in the Book of Poetry,
<blockquote>
"The king blazed with anger,
And he marshalled his hosts,<br/>
To stop the march to Chü,<br/>
To consolidate the prosperity of Châu,<br/>
To meet the expectations of the nation."
</blockquote>
This was the valour of king Wan. King Wan, in one burst of his anger, gave repose to all the people of the kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p>'In the Book of History it is said, "Heaven having produced the inferior people, made for them rulers and teachers, with the purpose that they should be assisting to God, and therefore distinguished them throughout the four quarters of the land. Whoever are offenders, and whoever are innocent, here am I to deal with them. How dare any under heaven give indulgence to their refractory wills?" There was one man pursuing a violent and disorderly course in the kingdom, and king Wû was ashamed of it. This was the valour of king Wû. He also, by one display of his anger, gave repose to all the people of the kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p>'Let now your Majesty also, in one burst of anger, give repose to all the people of the kingdom. The people are only afraid that your Majesty does not love valour.'</p></li>

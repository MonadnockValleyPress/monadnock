<h1>The Mencius</h1>
<h2>Book 1</h2>
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<h4>How a ruler may best take satisfaction for losses which he has sustained. That benevolent government will raise him high above his enemies.</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>King Hûi of Liang said, 'There was not in the nation a stronger State than Tsin, as you, venerable Sir, know. But since it descended to me, on the east we have been defeated by Ch'i, and then my eldest son perished; on the west we have lost seven hundred lî of territory to Ch'in; and on the south we have sustained disgrace at the hands of Ch'û. I have brought shame on my departed predecessors, and wish on their account to wipe it away, once for all. What course is to be pursued to accomplish this?'</p></li>
<li><p>Mencius replied, 'With a territory which is only a hundred lî square, it is possible to attain to the royal dignity.</p></li>
<li><p>'If Your Majesty will indeed dispense a benevolent government to the people, being sparing in the use of punishments and fines, and making the taxes and levies light, so causing that the fields shall be ploughed deep, and the weeding of them be carefully attended to, and that the strong-bodied, during their days of leisure, shall cultivate their filial piety, fraternal respectfulness, sincerity, and truthfulness, serving thereby, at home, their fathers and elder brothers, and, abroad, their elders and superiors,&mdash; you will then have a people who can be employed, with sticks which they have prepared, to oppose the strong mail and sharp weapons of the troops of Ch'in and Ch'û.</p></li>
<li><p>'The rulers of those States rob their people of their time, so that they cannot plough and weed their fields, in order to support their parents. Their parents suffer from cold and hunger. Brothers, wives, and children are separated and scattered abroad.</p></li>
<li><p>'Those rulers, as it were, drive their people into pit-falls, or drown them. Your Majesty will go to punish them. In such a case, who will oppose your Majesty?</p></li>
<li><p>'In accordance with this is the saying,&mdash; "The benevolent has no enemy." I beg your Majesty not to doubt what I say.'</p></li>

<h1>The Mencius</h1>
<h2>Book 1</h2>
<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
<h4>A prince should depend on himself, and not rely on, or try to propitiate, other powers.</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>The duke Wan of T'ang asked Mencius, saying, 'T'ang is a small kingdom, and lies between Ch'î and Ch'û. Shall I serve Ch'î? Or shall I serve Chû?'</p></li>
<li><p>Mencius replied, 'This plan which you propose is beyond me. If you will have me counsel you, there is one thing I can suggest. Dig deeper your moats; build higher your walls; guard them as well as your people. In case of attack, be prepared to die in your defence, and have the people so that they will not leave you;-- this is a proper course.</p></li>

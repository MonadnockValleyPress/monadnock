<h1>The Mencius</h1>
<h2>Book 1</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<h4>Benvolence and righteousness Mencius's only topics with the princes of his time; and the only principles which can make a country prosperous.</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>Mencius went to see king Hûi of Liang.</p></li>
<li><p>The king said, 'Venerable sir, since you have not counted it far to come here, a distance of a thousand lî, may I presume that you are provided with counsels to profit my kingdom?'</p></li>
<li><p>Mencius replied, 'Why must your Majesty use that word "profit?" What I am provided with, are counsels to benevolence and righteousness, and these are my only topics.</p></li>
<li><p>'If your Majesty say, "What is to be done to profit my kingdom?" the great officers will say, "What is to be done to profit our families?" and the inferior officers and the common people will say, "What is to be done to profit our persons?" Superiors and inferiors will try to snatch this profit the one from the other, and the kingdom will be endangered. In the kingdom of ten thousand chariots, the murderer of his sovereign shall be the chief of a family of a thousand chariots. In the kingdom of a thousand chariots, the murderer of his prince shall be the chief of a family of a hundred chariots. To have a thousand in ten thousand, and a hundred in a thousand, cannot be said not to be a large allotment, but if righteousness be put last, and profit be put first, they will not be satisfied without snatching all.</p></li>
<li><p>'There never has been a benevolent man who neglected his parents. There never has been a righteous man who made his sovereign an after consideration.</p></li>
<li><p>'Let your Majesty also say, "Benevolence and righteousness, and let these be your only themes." Why must you use that word &mdash; "profit?".</p></li>

<h1>A Letter</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
Last night I wrote a letter to my friend:<br/>
I said, "Come back, we two are getting old;<br/>
Our separate lives wear on; the years are cold,<br/>
And loneliness grows bitter toward the end."<br/>
I called you back, but you shall not behold<br/>
Those wise, sad words that my desire has penned;<br/>
Last night I wrote what I shall never send,<br/>
The page your white hands never shall unfold.
</p>
<p>
There in my desk it lies; pride guards the key;<br/>
And pride, alas, is stronger than desire.<br/>
Years hence perhaps some stranger, pityingly,<br/>
Will yield the faded secret to the fire,<br/>
Where it will join in dust those separate dead,<br/>
Sorrow who wrote and Love who never read.
</p>

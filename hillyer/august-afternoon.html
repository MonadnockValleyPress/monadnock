<h1>"August afternoon in a drowse"</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
August afternoon in a drowse,<br/>
No leaf moving on the boughs,<br/>
No ripple moving on the pool<br/>
Nor a thought in the mind of summer's fool<br/>
Who treads the shadow of delight;<br/>
Morning, afternoon, and night,<br/>
He treads the shadow of delight.
</p>
<p>
Tell him how the blackbirds flew<br/>
To form their flocks, two by two;<br/>
Warn him with the goldenrod<br/>
And brown seeds from the lily pod.<br/>
Stir the air with solemn warning<br/>
Afternoon and night and morning,<br/>
Till he heed your autumn warning.
</p>
<p>
Summer's fool will never heed<br/>
Though the whole earth go to seed.<br/>
Death will catch him unaware<br/>
With the vine leaves in his hair.<br/>
Leave him to his dream, for soon<br/>
Morning, night, or afternoon,<br/>
He will waken &mdash; all too soon!
</p>

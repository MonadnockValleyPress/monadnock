<h1>"He who in spring's rebirth has put his trust"</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
He who in spring's rebirth has put his trust<br/>
Now answers not to April or to May,<br/>
Nor sees the moon-white apple blossom sway,<br/>
Nor breathes its sweetness on the evening gust.<br/>
He who was first to climb the height of day<br/>
Lies full-length in the valley of the dust;<br/>
His sword sleeps in his hand, and it is rust;<br/>
His heart sleeps in his breast, and it is clay.
</p>
<p>
Brother, so mute among the fallen years,<br/>
We come at dayspring to your living tomb<br/>
That is the green earth, and we shed no tears,<br/>
Knowing that if you wander otherwhere<br/>
Soon will you give us gracious welcome there,<br/>
And if you perished, then we share your doom.
</p>

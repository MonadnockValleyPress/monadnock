<h1>Quickly and Pleasantly the Seasons Blow</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
Quickly and pleasantly the seasons blow<br/>
Over the meadows of eternity,<br/>
As wave on wave the pulsings of the sea<br/>
Merge and are lost, each in the other's flow.<br/>
Time is no lover; it is only he<br/>
That is the one unconquerable foe,<br/>
He is the sudden tempest none can know,<br/>
Winged with swift winds that none may hope to flee.
</p>
<p>
Fair child of loveliness, these endless fears<br/>
Are nought to us; let us be gods of stone,<br/>
And set our images beyond the years<br/>
On some high mount where we can be alone;<br/>
And thou shalt ever be as now thou art,<br/>
And I shall watch thee with untroubled heart.
</p>

<h1>Long After Both of Us are Scattered Dust</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
Long after both of us are scattered dust,<br/>
And alien souls, perchance, shall read of thee,<br/>
Guessing the passions that have crushed from me<br/>
These poor confessions of my love and trust;<br/>
Ah, well I know how heartless they will be,<br/>
For some will laugh, and others, more unjust,<br/>
Whose minds know not of love, but only lust,<br/>
Will stain the vesture of our memory.
</p>
<p>
And yet a few there may be who will feel<br/>
My true devotion and my deep desires,<br/>
And know that these unhappy lines reveal<br/>
Only new images in changeless fires;<br/>
And they, indeed, will linger with a sigh<br/>
To think that beauty such as thine must die.
</p>

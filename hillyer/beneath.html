<h1>"As one who bears beneath his neighbour's roof"</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
As one who bears beneath his neighbour's roof<br/>
Some thrust that staggers his unready wit<br/>
And brooding through the night on such reproof<br/>
Too late conceives the apt reply to it,<br/>
So all our life is but an afterthought,<br/>
A puzzle solved long past the time of need,<br/>
And tardy wisdom that one failure bought<br/>
Finds no occasion to be used in deed.
</p>
<p>
Fate harries us; we answer not a word,<br/>
Or answering too late, we waste our breath;<br/>
Not even a belated quip is heard<br/>
From those who bore the final taunt of death;<br/>
And thus the Jester parries all retort:<br/>
His jest eternal, and our lives so short.

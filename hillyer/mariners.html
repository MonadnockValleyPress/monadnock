<h1>"O Mariners of the Sun"</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
O Mariners of the Sun, you have reached your port!<br/>
Under the Mountain of Twilight how still the mooring!<br/>
The golden boat grows dim, and you disembark.<br/>
In the taverns of nether earth may you meet rare sport,<br/>
And loves madder than ours if no more enduring,<br/>
And a night sweeter than our night though as short.<br/>
O Mariners, in that city of the dark<br/>
Forget not the greetings I gave you for my friend:<br/>
Tell her how sometimes I would rush out to find her,<br/>
And sometimes I bide unmoved, but for ever send<br/>
Love, and for ever love. And again remind her<br/>
That soon or late I will join her in the end.
</p>

<h1>Through the Deep Night the Leaves Speak</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
Through the deep night the leaves speak, tree to tree.<br/>
Where are the stars? the frantic clouds ride high,<br/>
The swelling gusts of wind blow down the sky,<br/>
Shaking the thoughts from the leaves, garrulously.<br/>
Through the deep night, articulate to me,<br/>
They question your untimely passing-by;<br/>
Your spring is still in flower, must you fly<br/>
Windswept so soon down lanes of memory?
</p>
<p>
Through the deep night the trees recount the past,<br/>
The lovers that have long ago gone hence,<br/>
And whom you joined ere love had reached her prime.<br/>
Chill with an early autumn's immanence,<br/>
Through the dark night plunges the sudden blast,<br/>
Sweeping the young leaves down before their time.

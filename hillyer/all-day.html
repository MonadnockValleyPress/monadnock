<h1>"All day from smoky roofs"</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
All day from smoky roofs the snow<br/>
Has thudded to the yards below<br/>
And melted, till at evening<br/>
The warmth and wet of early spring<br/>
Hang in a haze where every sound<br/>
Comes muffled as from underground,<br/>
And every faint sensation, fraught<br/>
With the finality of thought,<br/>
Entices from their dark chambers<br/>
Other days that the mind remembers<br/>
Because they also had looked back<br/>
Where memory itself goes black.
</p>
<p>
The rift in winter brings to pass<br/>
A wilder glory than green grass,<br/>
An ampler light than ever came<br/>
On blossoms trembling into flame.<br/>
The passersby with open coats<br/>
Rise huge and sudden like the boats<br/>
Which loom portentous on the lee<br/>
Through early morning fog at sea;<br/>
And on the lawn where snow grows thin<br/>
Sparrows raise an increasing din<br/>
In crazy revelry of noise<br/>
Like congresses of yelling boys;<br/>
Yet waning in the rear, refined<br/>
By space, their clamour brings to mind<br/>
The April evening when first<br/>
On unaccustomed hearing burst<br/>
The voice of blackbirds singing plain:<br/>
We have come back! come back again!
</p>
<p>
I know it now, on every hand<br/>
Murmurs the thawing meadowland;<br/>
I smell the maple sap, I feel<br/>
The uncertain breeze advance and wheel;<br/>
Almost without persuasion see<br/>
The blue wood close in after me,<br/>
Conspiring dimly, tree by tree;<br/>
As mated over empty miles<br/>
One clear bell rings, one clear star smiles.
</p>
<p>
In the grim city I have known<br/>
The glow has melted bricks and stone,<br/>
For this is the promise never kept<br/>
By spring herself. We that slept<br/>
Wake for one moment longer than<br/>
The generations known to man;<br/>
Beyond our first syllable find speech,<br/>
Beyond our halted breathing reach<br/>
Toward the all-comprehending air,<br/>
And, fearing no denial, share<br/>
The undiminished draught which gives<br/>
Life manifold to all that lives.<br/>
Nor will the familiar dead be still;<br/>
They hasten toward me down the hill.<br/>
Though memory on living ears<br/>
Make not a sound, each phantom hears<br/>
His name, as though the thought had spun<br/>
A summons down oblivion.<br/>
They come whose spring is never past,<br/>
Langland and Chaucer, friends at last,<br/>
Shakspere and Drayton and John Donne,<br/>
Sidney and tuneful Campion.<br/>
And Herrick, with uplifted nose<br/>
Snuffing the air for wine or a rose.<br/>
Heroes put on their mail of flesh;<br/>
Istar's beloved, Gilgamesh;<br/>
Achilles, the great surly boy<br/>
Who slumbers well by windy Troy;<br/>
And he who snatched his father's crown<br/>
To bring the fire of Heaven down.<br/>
And queens, coy at a random smile,<br/>
Rise from their turquoise tombs a while,<br/>
Sweet Nefertiti of the Nile,<br/>
And those twin stars of every sky<br/>
Without whose names romance would die:<br/>
Blithe Helena who slew for love<br/>
And Cleopatra slain for love;<br/>
And virgin still to lust or death,<br/>
Incomparable Elizabeth.<br/>
So they come on without an end,<br/>
The long dead and the last year's friend,<br/>
Intangible as melody<br/>
Or the new wind rising from the sea.<br/>
They come in a thought, in a thought go by,<br/>
Because it is spring and I too shall die,<br/>
Because it is spring and they too were young,<br/>
And the songs we would hear were never sung.
</p>
<p>
O changeless city of my pain,<br/>
I know they pass and you remain;<br/>
I know that evening thaws not twice<br/>
Your thews of stone, your heart of ice,<br/>
And yet remember, though in vain,<br/>
How once you harboured Paradise.

<h1>As Dreamers through Their Dreams Surmise</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
As dreamers through their dreams surmise<br/>
The stealthy passage of the night,<br/>
We half-remember smoky skies<br/>
And city streets and hurrying flight,<br/>
Another world from this clear height<br/>
Whereon our starry altars rise.
</p>
<p>
Beneath our towering waste of stone<br/>
The fragile ships creep to and fro,<br/>
By tempest riven and overthrown,<br/>
The toys of these same tides that flow<br/>
Against our pillars far below<br/>
With faint, insistent monotone.
</p>
<p>
The snarling winds against our rocks<br/>
Hurl breakers in a fleecy mass,<br/>
Like wolves that chase stampeding flocks<br/>
Over the brink of a crevasse,<br/>
While thunders down the Alpine pass<br/>
The deluge of the equinox.
</p>
<p>
Lost in that stormy atmosphere,<br/>
Men chart their seas and trudge their roads;<br/>
Inviolate, we scorn to hear<br/>
Their shouted warning that forebodes
</p>
<p>
An end to these fair episodes<br/>
Of life beneath our tranquil sky;<br/>
Having sought only peace, then why<br/>
Should we go down to death with fear?
</p>

<h1>"The great desire that urged these trees so high"</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
The great desire that urged these trees so high<br/>
Runs thinly in your veins tonight; you hear<br/>
Their language with an unaccustomed ear<br/>
And guess at alien conspiracy.<br/>
So in mid-June one sapling will turn sere<br/>
Though it has drunk its share of wind and sky,<br/>
And in its leaves November voices cry<br/>
Long months before the wilting of the year.
</p>
<p>
Though in fair fields your life was planted firm,<br/>
Some seedling ill grew with you from the start<br/>
And at your roots thought like a busy worm<br/>
Ticked inward slowly, till you stood apart<br/>
When youth had run but half its lovely term,<br/>
And heard the spring with autumn in your heart.

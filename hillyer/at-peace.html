<h1>"Let us for ever be at peace"</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
Let us for ever be at peace<br/>
As walls and mountains are,<br/>
Or as the ocean storms that cease<br/>
When smoother tides would hold a star.<br/>
We strove with shadows for so long,<br/>
We sped our youth so fast,<br/>
But now the bell has rung for evensong<br/>
And sleep, at last.
</p>
<p>
How many frolics we have seen<br/>
Who now shall frisk no more,<br/>
And made pretense of budding green<br/>
When autumn ripened at the core.<br/>
When wit was wanting words were long<br/>
And folly made reply,<br/>
Now all our words are but good-night, our song<br/>
A lullaby.
</p>

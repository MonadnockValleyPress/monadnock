<h1>"Always more riches, more enjoyment, more"</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
Always more riches, more enjoyment, more<br/>
Of everything the world can briefly give,<br/>
Though through your avid hands as through a sieve<br/>
Beauties unnumbered and unnoticed pour.<br/>
You chase the wind, but you are fugutive<br/>
From the great quiet at the whirlwind's core,<br/>
And spendthrigt of life's measurable store<br/>
You have not purchased the mere right to live.
</p>
<p>
There is a vacant seat beside me here<br/>
Where you may rest and watch the season change;<br/>
Form, colour, tone, mysterious or clear,<br/>
In swift variety though never strange,<br/>
Where if one beauty wholly be revealed<br/>
Life will have yielded all she has to yield.
</p>

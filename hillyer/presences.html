<h1>I Pass My Days in Ghostly Presences</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
I pass my days in ghostly presences,<br/>
And when the wind at night is mute,<br/>
Far down the valley I can hear a flute<br/>
And a strange voice, not knowing what it says.
</p>
<p>
And sometimes in the interim of days,<br/>
I hear a fountain in obscure abodes,<br/>
Singing with none but me to hear, the lays<br/>
That would do pleasure to the ears of gods.
</p>
<p>
And faces pass, but haply they are dreams,<br/>
Dreams of a mind set free that gilds<br/>
The solitude with awful light and builds<br/>
Temples and lovers, goblins and triremes.
</p>
<p>
Give me a chair and liberate the sun,<br/>
And glancing motes to twinkle down its bars,<br/>
That I may sit above oblivion,<br/>
And weave myself a universe of stars.
</p>

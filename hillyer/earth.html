<h1>Now the Sick Earth Revives</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
Now the sick earth revives, and in the sun<br/>
The wet soil gives a fragrance to the air;<br/>
The days of many colours are begun,<br/>
And early promises of meadows fair<br/>
With starry petals, and of trees now bare<br/>
Soon to be lyric with the trilling choir,<br/>
And lovely with new leaves, spread everywhere<br/>
A subtle flame that sets the heart on fire<br/>
With thoughts of other springs and dreams of new desire.
</p>
<p>
The mind will never dwell within the present,<br/>
It weeps for vanished years or hopes for new;<br/>
This morn of wakened warmth, so calm, so pleasant,<br/>
So gaily gemmed with diadems of dew,<br/>
When buds swell on the bough, and robins woo<br/>
Their loves with notes bell-like and crystal-clear,<br/>
The spirit stirs from sleep, yet wonders, too,<br/>
Whence comes the hint of sorrow or of fear<br/>
Making it move rebellious within its narrow sphere.
</p>
<p>
This flash of sun, this flight of wings in riot,<br/>
This festival of sound, of sight, of smell,<br/>
Wakes in the spirit a profound disquiet,<br/>
And greeting seems the foreword of farewell.<br/>
Budding like all the world, the soul would swell<br/>
Out of its withering mortality;<br/>
Flower immortal, burst from its heavy shell,<br/>
Fly far with love beyond the world and sea,<br/>
Out of the grasp of change, from time and twilight free.
</p>
<p>
Could the unknowing gods, waked in compassion,<br/>
Eternalize the splendour of this hour,<br/>
And from the world's frail garlands strongly fashion<br/>
An ageless Paradise, celestial bower,<br/>
Where our long-sundered souls could rise in power<br/>
To the complete fulfilment of their dream,<br/>
And never know again that years devour<br/>
Petals and light, bird-note and woodland theme,<br/>
And floods of young desire, bright as a silver stream,
</p>
<p>
Should we be happy, thou and I together,<br/>
Lying in love eternally in spring,<br/>
Watching the buds unfold that shall not wither,<br/>
Hearing the birds calling and answering,
</p>
<p>
When the leaves stir and all the meadows ring?<br/>
Smelling the rich earth steaming in the sun,<br/>
Feeling between caresses the light wing<br/>
Of the wind whose gracious flight is never done,&mdash;<br/>
Should we be happy then? happy, elusive One?
</p>
<p>
But no, here in this fragile flesh abides<br/>
The secret of a measureless delight,<br/>
Hidden in dying beauty there resides<br/>
Something undying, something that takes its flight<br/>
When the dust turns to dust, and day to night,<br/>
And spring to fall, whose joys in love redeem<br/>
Eternally, life's changes and death's blight,<br/>
Even as these pale, tender petals seem<br/>
A glimpse of infinite beauty, flashed in a passing dream.

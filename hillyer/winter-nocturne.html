<h1>Winter Nocturne</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
Some of that August day's long-dead delight<br/>
Came back to me, as on a winter hill<br/>
I saw red sunset fall away and spill<br/>
Its scattered jewels on the lap of night.
</p>
<p>
We two had always been so calm, so still,<br/>
That silence was not lonely, and despite<br/>
The shadow deepening over the snowy white,<br/>
A warmth, as of your presence, smote the chill.
</p>
<p>
Whatever men may call the real, the true,<br/>
This much I know indeed, that an immense<br/>
And actual radiance such as only you<br/>
Have ever given to my mortal sense<br/>
Gleamed on the hillside and then vanished hence;<br/>
And all that winter night the south wind blew.

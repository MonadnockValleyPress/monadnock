<h1>In Gardens When the Sun Is Set</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
In gardens when the sun is set,<br/>
The air is heavy with the wet<br/>
Faint smell of leaves, and dark incense<br/>
Of peach-blossom and violet.
</p>
<p>
There is no lurking foe to fear,<br/>
Only the friendly ghosts are here<br/>
Of lazy youth and dozing age,<br/>
Who sat and mellowed year by year,
</p>
<p>
Until they merged with all the rest<br/>
Beneath the overhanging west,<br/>
And took their sleep with tranquil hearts<br/>
Safe in our Mother's mighty breast.
</p>
<p>
If there be any sound, 'tis sweet,<br/>
The hidden rush of eager feet<br/>
Where robins flutter in the dust,<br/>
Or perch upon the garden-seat,
</p>
<p>
And little voices that are known<br/>
To those who contemplate alone<br/>
The busy universe that moves<br/>
In gardens rank and overgrown.
</p>
<p>
Here in the garden we are one,<br/>
The golden dust, the setting sun,<br/>
The languid leaves, the birds and I,&mdash;<br/>
Small bubbles on oblivion.
</p>

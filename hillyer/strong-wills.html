<h1>"Strong wills there are that dare the worst, and break"</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
Strong wills there are that dare the worst, and break;<br/>
Strong minds that in a mortal season ponder<br/>
Immortal wisdom: willing feet that wander<br/>
Forbidden ways; pure spirits that forsake<br/>
The city's custom, and beside the lake<br/>
Of loneliness give heed; and those who squander<br/>
Their legacy of faith, that here, not yonder,<br/>
Life's fruit, though green, fall from the bough they shake.
</p>
<p>
Destiny on her pediment still smiles.<br/>
She knows the doors they knock at, and the key<br/>
Lies in her hands. She triumphs in withholding<br/>
Her secret, though in pity she beguiles<br/>
Their senses with a dream of earth and sea<br/>
That Truth be unsuspected, though enfolding.

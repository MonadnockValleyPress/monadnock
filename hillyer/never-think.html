<h1>"Never think of me, never remember"</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
"Never think of me, never remember,"<br/>
She was singing in her chamber<br/>
High in the attic under the eaves<br/>
Where dusty windows are screened with leaves.
</p>
<p>
"Never think of me, never remember,"<br/>
She was singing in her chamber,<br/>
She did not hear the knocker clang<br/>
Or a voice below that also sang.
</p>
<p>
Her wheel whirred on, the flax spun out<br/>
A cobweb strand as thin as doubt,<br/>
The green leaves tapped on the window pane,<br/>
And someone knocked and knocked again.
</p>
<p>
She did not hear the knocker clang<br/>
Or the voice below that also sang:<br/>
"Not many years &mdash; and the heart still young<br/>
Weaves new words for the willing tongue.
</p>
<p>
"Not many years have passed, and the heart<br/>
Still young is led to where thou art<br/>
By a slender strand of flaxen hair,<br/>
By a strand of song as thin as air."
</p>
<p>
The wheel whirred on, and grain by grain<br/>
The grey dust filmed the window pane;<br/>
She did not hear him when he knocked<br/>
For the leaves were thick and the windows locked.
</p>
<p>
She did not hear, now faint and far<br/>
Like music heard through doors ajar:<br/>
"Not many years have passed, are past,<br/>
But dust will stifle the heart at last."
</p>
<p>
High in the attic under the eaves<br/>
The dusty windows are screened with leaves.<br/>
"Never think of me, never remember,"<br/>
She was singing in her chamber.

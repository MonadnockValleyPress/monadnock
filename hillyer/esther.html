<h1>Esther Dancing</h1>
<h2>by Robert Hillyer</h2>
<p>
Speak not nor stir. Here music is alive,<br/>
Woven from those swift fingers, strong and light,<br/>
Marching across those singing hands, or shed<br/>
Slowly, like echoes down the muffled night,<br/>
Or beautifully translated, note by note,<br/>
Some fainter voice, rhapsodic and remote,<br/>
Or shaken out in melodies that dive<br/>
Clear into fathoms of profounder things,<br/>
Then suddenly again on rising wings,<br/>
Burst into sun and hover overhead.
</p>
<p>
Incarnate music flashing into form<br/>
Fled from the vineyards of melodious Greece,<br/>
Feet that have flown before the gathering storm<br/>
Or glanced in gardens of the Golden Fleece,<br/>
Face atune to all the songs that mass<br/>
Their gusts of passion on the sunlit grass,<br/>
Image of lyric hope and veiled despair,<br/>
Like them, thou shalt unutterably pass<br/>
Into the silence and the shadowed air.

<h1>Monadnock Valley Press: Credits</h1>
<p>The <a href='/'>Monadnock Valley Press</a> above all acknowledges the authors who wrote the works we republish. We stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>These texts were originally published on paper or papyrus. Thanks to those who keyed in, scanned, or checked these texts so that they are now available in digital form. Many of the works published here have been adapted from <a href='https://gutenberg.org/'>Project Gutenberg</a>, <a href='https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikisource</a>, the <a href='http://shakespeare.mit.edu/'>MIT Shakespeare Project</a>, and similar sources.</p>
<p>The stylesheets used by the Monadnock Valley Press are modified versions of those produced by <a href='http://tess.oconnor.cx/'>Tess O'Connor</a> for her online edition of <a href='http://federali.st/'>The Federalist Papers</a>, and are used with permission.</p>
<p>The Monadnock Valley Press is a side project of <a href='https://stpeter.im/'>Peter Saint-Andre</a>, who is primarily active as a <a href='https://philosopher.coach/'>philosophical coach</a>, <a href='https://stpeter.im/writings/'>writer</a>, <a href='https://stpeter.im/tech/'>technologist</a>, and <a href='https://stpeter.im/music/'>musician</a>.</p>

<h3>RECORD TEN</h3>
<h4>A Letter</h4>
<h4>A Membrane</h4>
<h4>Hairy I</h4>
<p>Yesterday was for me like the filter paper that chemists use for filtering their solutions (all suspended and superfluous particles remain on the paper). This morning I went downstairs all purified and distilled, transparent.</p>
<p>Downstairs in the hall the controller sat at a small table, constantly looking at her watch and recording the Numbers who were leaving. Her name is U- . . . well, I prefer not to give her Number, for I fear I may not write kindly about her&mdash;although, as a matter of fact, she is a very respectable, mature woman. The only thing I do not like in her is that her cheeks fold down a little like the gills of a fish (although I don't see anything wrong in this appearance). She scratched with her pen and I saw on the page "D-503"&mdash;and suddenly, splash! an ink blot. No sooner did I open my mouth to call her attention to that than she raised her head and blotted me with an inky smile. "There is a letter for you. You will receive it, dear. Yes, yes, you will."</p>
<p>I knew a letter, after she had read it, must go through the Bureau of Guardians (I think it is unnecessary to explain in detail this natural order of things); I would receive it not later than twelve o'clock. But that tiny smile confused me; the drop of ink clouded the transparency of the distilled solution. At the <cite>Integral</cite>'s dock I could not concentrate; I even made a mistake in my calculations, something that had never happened to me before.</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock, again the rosy-brown fish gills' smile, and at last the letter was in my hands. I cannot say why I did not read it right there; instead, I put it in my pocket and ran into my room. I opened it, scanned it quickly, and . . . sat down. It was an official notice to the effect that Number I-330 had had me assigned to her, and that today at twenty-one o'clock I was to go to her. Her address was given.</p>
<p>"No! After all that had happened! After I had shown her frankly my attitude toward her! Besides, how could she know that I did not go to the Bureau of Guardians? She had no way of knowing that I have been ill and could not . . . . And despite all this . . ."</p>
<p>A dynamo was whirling and buzzing in my head. Buddha . . . yellow . . . lilies of the valley . . . rosy crescent . . . . Besides&mdash;besides, O- wanted to come to see me today! I was sure she would not believe (how could one believe?) that I had absolutely nothing to do with the matter, that . . . I was also sure that we (O- and I) would have a difficult, foolish, and absolutely illogical conversation. No, anything but that! Let the situation solve itself mechanically; I would send her a copy of the official communication.</p>
<p>While I was hastily putting the paper in my pocket, I noticed my terrible ape-like hand. I remembered how that day, during our walk, she had taken my hand and looked at it. Is it possible that she really . . . that she . . .</p>
<p>A quarter to twenty-one. A white northern night. Everything was glass, greenish. But it was a different kind of glass, not like ours, not genuine but very breakable, a thin glass shell, and within that shell things were lying, whirling, buzzing. I wouldn't have been surprised if suddenly the cupola of the auditorium had risen in slow, rolliug clouds of smoke; or if the ripe moon had sent an inky smile, like that one at the little table this morning; or if in every house suddenly all the curtains had been lowered, and behind the curtains . . .</p>
<p>1 felt something peculiar; my ribs were like iron bars that interfered, decidedly interfered, with my heart, giving it too little space. I stood at a glass door on which were the golden letters I-330. I-330 sat at the table with her back to me; she was writing something. I stepped in.</p>
<p>"Here"*&mdash;I held out the pink check&mdash;"I received the notice this noon and here I am!"</p>
<p>"How punctual you are! Just a minute, please, may I? Sit down. I shall finish in a minute."</p>
<p>She lowered her eyes to the letter. What had she there, behind her lowered curtains? What would she say? What would she do in a second? How to learn it? How to calculate it, since she comes from beyond, from the wild, ancient land of dreams? I looked at her in silence. My ribs were iron bars. The space for the heart was too small.</p>
<p>When she speaks, her face is like a swiftly revolving, glittering wheel; you cannot see the separate bars. But at that moment the wheel was motionless. I saw a strange combination: dark eyebrows running right to the temples a sharp, mocking triangle; and still another dark triangle with its apex upward&mdash;two deep~wrinkles from the nose to the angles of the mouth. And these two triangles somehow contradicted each other. They gave the whole face that disagreeable, irritating X, or cross&mdash;a face marked obliquely by a cross.</p>
<p>The wheel started to tum; its bars blurred.</p>
<p>"So you did not go to the Bureau of Guardians, after all?"</p>
<p>"I did . . . I did not feel well . . . I could not."</p>
<p>"Yes? I thought so; something must have prevented you, it matters little what"&mdash;sharp teeth&mdash;a smile. "But now you are in my hands. You remember: 'Any Number who within forty-eight hours fails to report to the Bureau is considered . . .'"</p>
<p>My heart banged so forcibly that the iron bars bent. If I were not sitting . . . like a little boy, how stupid! I was caught like a little boy, and stupidly I kept silent. I felt I was in a net; neither my legs nor my arms . . .</p>
<p>She stood up and stretched herself lazily. She pressed the button, and the curtains on all four walls fell with a slight rustle. I was cut off from the rest of the world, alone with her.</p>
<p>She was somewhere behind me, near the closet door. The unif was rustling, falling. I was listening, all listening. I remembered&mdash;no, it glistened in my mind for one hundredth of a second&mdash;I once had to calculate the curve of a new type of street membrane. (These membranes are handsomely decorated and are placed over all the avenues, registering all street conversations for the Bureau of Guardians.) I remembered a rosy, concave, trembling membrane, a strange being consisting of one organ only, an ear. I was at that moment such a membrane.</p>
<p>Now the "click" of the snap at her collar, at her breast, and ... lower. The glassy silk rustled over her shoulders and knees, over the floor. I heard&mdash;and it was clearer than actually seeing&mdash;I heard how one foot stepped out of the grayish-blue heap of silk, then the other . . . . Soon I'd hear the creak of the bed, and . . .</p>
<p>The tensely stretched membrane trembled and registered the silence&mdash;no, the sharp, hammerlike blows of the heart against the iron bars, and endless pauses between beats. And I heard, saw, how she, behind me, hesitated for a second, thinking. The door of the closet . . . . It slammed; again silk . . . silk . . .</p>
<p>"Well, all right."</p>
<p>I turned around. She was dressed in a saffron-yellow dress of an ancient style. This was a thousand times worse than if she had not been dressed at all. Two sharp points glowing with rosiness through the thin tissue; two burning embers piercing through ashes; two tender, round knees . . .</p>
<p>She was sitting in a low armchair. In front of her on a small square table I noticed a bottle filled with something poisonously green, and two small glasses with thin stems. In the corner of her mouth she had a very thin paper tube; she was ejecting smoke formed by the burning of that ancient smoking substance whose name I do not now remember.</p>
<p>The membrane was still vibrating. Within, the sledge-hammer was pounding the red-hot iron bars of my chest. I heard distinctly every blow of the hammer, and . . . What if she, too, heard it?</p>
<p>But she continued to produce smoke very calmly; calmly she looked at me; and nonchalantly she flicked ashes on the pink check!</p>
<p>With as much self-control as possible I asked, "If you still feel that way, why did you have me assigned to you? And why did you make me come here?"</p>
<p>As if she had not heard at all, she poured some of the green liquid from the bottle into one of the small glasses, and sipped it.</p>
<p>"Wonderful liqueur! Want some?"</p>
<p>Then I understood: alcohol! Like lightning there came to memory what I had seen yesterday: the stony hand of the Well-Doer, the unbearable blade of the electric ray; there on the Cube, the head thrown back, the stretched-out body! I shivered.</p>
<p>"Please listen," I said. "You know, do you not, that anyone who poisons himself with nicotine, and more particularly with alcohol, is severely treated by the United State?"</p>
<p>Dark brows raised high to the temples, the sharp mocking triangle.</p>
<p>"'It is more reasonable to annihilate a few than to allow many to poison themselves . . . . And degeneration,' · . · etc. . . . This is true to the point of indecency."</p>
<p>"Indecency?"</p>
<p>"Yes. To let out into the street such a group of baldheaded, naked little truths. Only imagine, please. Imagine, say, that persistent admirer of mine&mdash;S-, well, you know him. Then imagine: if he should discard the deception of clothes and appear in public in his true form.... Oh!" She laughed. But I clearly saw her lower, sorrowful triangle: two deep grooves from the nose to the mouth. And for some reason these grooves made me think: that doublecurved being, half-hunched, with winglike ears&mdash;he embraced her? Her, such . . . Oh!</p>
<p>Naturally, I try now merely to express my abnormal feelings of that moment. Now, as I write, I understand perfectly that all this is as it should be; that he, S-4711, like any other honest Number, has a perfect right to the joys of life, and that it would be unjust . . . But I think the point is quite clear.</p>
<p>I-330 laughed a long, strange laugh. Then she cast a look at me, into me.</p>
<p>"The most curious thing is that I am not in the least afraid of you. You are such a dear, I am sure of it! You would never think of going to the Bureau and reporting that I drink liqueurs and smoke. You will be sick or busy, or I don't know what . . . . Furthermore, I am sure you will drink this charming poison with me."</p>
<p>What an impertinent, mocking tone! I felt definitely that in a moment I would hate her. (Why in a moment? In fact, I hated her all the time.)</p>
<p>I-330 tilted the little glass of green poison straight into her mouth. Then she stood up, and all rosy through the translucent saffron-yellow tissue, she made a few steps and stopped behind my chair . . . . Suddenly her arms were about my neck . . . her lips grew into mine, no, even somewhere much deeper, much more terribly . . . . I swear all this was very unexpected for me. That is why perhaps . . . for I could not&mdash;at this moment I see clearly&mdash;I could not myself have the desire to . . .</p>
<p>Unbearably sweet lips. (I suppose it was the taste of the liqueur.) It was as though burning poison were being poured into me, and more, andmore . . . .</p>
<p>1 tore away from the earth and began revolving as an independent planet, down, down, following an incalculable curve . . . .</p>
<p>What happened next I am able to describe only in an approximate way, only by way of more or less suitable analogies.</p>
<p>It never occurred to me before but it is true: we who live on the earth, we are always walking over a seething red sea of fire which is hidden in the womb of the earth. We never think of it. But imagine the ground under our feet suddenly transformed into a thin glass shell; suddenly we should behold . . . !</p>
<p>I became glass-like and saw within myself. There were two selves in me. One, the former D-503, Number D-503; and the other . . . Before, that other used only to show his hairy paws from time to time, but now that whole other self left his shell. That shell was breaking, and in a moment . . . .</p>
<p>Grasping the last straw (the arms of the chair) with all my strength, I asked loudly (so as to hear my first self), "Where, where did you get this poison?"</p>
<p>"Oh, this? A physician, one of my . . . ."</p>
<p>"'One of my one of my' what?" And my other self jumped up suddenly and yelled: "I won't allow it! I want no one but me . . . I shall kill anyone who . . . Because I . . . You . . ." I saw my other self grasp her rudely with his hairy paws, tear the silk, and put his teeth in her flesh! . . . I remember exactly, his teeth! . . .</p>
<p>I do not remember how, but I-330 slipped away and I saw her straighten, her head raised high, her eyes overlaid by that cursed, impenetrable curtain. She stood leaning with her back against the closet door and listening to me.</p>
<p>I remember I was on the floor; I embraced her limbs, kissed her knees, and cried supplicatingly, "At once, right away, right away."</p>
<p>Sharp teeth . . . . The sharp, mocking triangle of the brows. . . . She bent over and in silence unbuttoned my badge.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, dear&mdash;dear."
<p>I began hastily to remove my unif. But I-330, silent as before, lifted my badge to my eyes, showing me the clock upon it. It was twenty-two-twenty-five.</p>
<p>I became cold. I knew what it meant to be out in the street after twenty-two-thirty. My insanity disappeared at once. I was again I. I saw clearly one thing: I hated her, hated her, hated . . . . Without saying good-by, without looking back, I ran out of the room. Hurriedly trying to fasten the badge back in its place, I ran down the stairs (I was afraid lest someone notice me in the elevator), and tore out into a deserted street.</p>
<p>Everything was in its place; life so simple, ordinary, orderly. Glittering glass houses, pale glass sky, a greenish, motionless night. But under that cool glass something wild, something red and hairy, was silently seething. I was gasping for breath, but I continued to run so as not to be late.</p>
<p>Suddenly I felt that my badge which I had hurriedly pinned on was detaching itself; it came off and fell to the sidewalk. I bent over to pick it up and in the momentary silence I heard somebody's steps. I turned. Someone small and hunched was disappearing around the corner. At least so it seemed. I started to run as fast as I could. The wind whistled in my ears. At the entrance to my house I stopped and looked at the clock; one minute to twenty-two-thirty! I listened; nobody behind. It was my foolish imagination, the effect of the poison.</p>
<p>The night was full of torture. My bed seemed to lift itself under me, then to fall again, then up again! I used autosuggestion: "At night all the Numbers must sleep; sleeping at night is a duty just like working during the day. To sleep at night is necessary for the next day's work. Not to sleep at night is criminal." Yet I could not sleep&mdash;I could not. I was perishing! I was unable to fulfill my duties to the United State! I . . .</p>

<h3>RECORD FORTY</h3>
<h4>Facts</h4>
<h4>The Bell</h4>
<h4>I Am Certain</h4>
Daylight. It is clear. The baronleter-760 mm. Is it possible that I, D-503, really wrote these-pages? Is it possible that I ever felt, or imagined I felt, all this?
The handwriting is mine. And ~hat follows is all in my handwriting. Fortunately, only the handwriting. No more delirium, no absurd metaphors, no feelings-only, facts. For I am healthy-perfectly, absolutely healthy. . I am smiling; I cannot help smiling; a splinter has been taken out of my head, and I feel so light, so empty! To be lTIOre exact, not empty, but there is nothing foreign, nothing that prevents me from smiling. (Smiling is· the normal state for a normal human being.)
The facts are as follows: That evening my neighbor who discovered the finiteness of· the universe, and I, and all others who did not have a certificate showing that we had been operated on, all of us were taken to the nearest auditorium. (For some reason the number of the auditorium, 112, seemed familiar to me.) There they tied us to the tables and performed the great operation. Next day, I, D-503, appeared before the Well-Doer and told him everything known to me about the enemies of happiness. Why, before, it had seemed hard for me to go, I cannot understand. The only explanation seems to be my illness-my souL

That same evening, sitting at the same table with Him, with the \Vell-Doer, I saw for the first time in my life the famous Gas Chamber. They brought in that woman. She was to testify in my presence. She remained stubbornly silent and smiling. I noticed that she had sharp and very white teeth which were very pretty.
Then she was brought under the Bell. Her face became very white, and as her eyes were large and dark, all was very pretty. When they began pumping the air from under the Bell she threw her head back and half-closed her eyes; her lips were pressed together. This relninded me of something. She looked at me, holding the arms of the chair firmly. She continued to look until her eyes closed. Then she was taken out and brought back to consciousness by means of electrodes, and again she was put under the Bell. The procedure was repeated three times, yet she did not utter a word.
The others who were brought in with that woman proved to be more honest; many of them began to speak after the first trial. Tomorrow they will all ascend the steps to the Machine of the Well-Doer. No postponement is possible, for there still is chaos, groaning, cadavers, beasts in the western section; and to our regret there are still quantities of Numbers who have betrayed Reason.
But on the transverse avenue Forty we have succeeded in establishing a temporary Wall of high-voltage waves. And I hope we win. More than that; I am certain we shall win. For Reason must prevail.

<h1>The Prophet: On Religion</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>And an old priest said, Speak to us of Religion.</p>
<p>And he said:</p>
<p>
Have I spoken this day of aught else?<br/>
Is not religion all deeds and all reflection,<br/>
And that which is neither deed nor reflection, but a wonder and a surprise ever springing in the soul, even while the hands hew the stone or tend the loom?<br/>
Who can separate his faith from his actions, or his belief from his occupations?<br/>
Who can spread his hours before him, saying,<br/>
"This for God and this for myself;<br/>
"This for my soul and this other for my body"?<br/>
All your hours are wings that beat through space from self to self.<br/>
He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked.<br/>
The wind and the sun will tear no holes in his skin.<br/>
And he who defines his conduct by ethics imprisons his song-bird in a cage.<br/>
The freest song comes not through bars and wires.<br/>
And he to whom worshipping is a window, to open but also to shut, has not yet visited the house of his soul whose windows are from dawn to dawn.
</p>
<p>
Your daily life is your temple and your religion.<br/>
Whenever you enter into it take with you your all.<br/>
Take the slough and the forge and the mallet and the lute,<br/>
The things you have fashioned in necessity or for delight.<br/>
For in reverie you cannot rise above your achievements nor fall lower than your failures.<br/>
And take with you all men:<br/>
For in adoration you cannot fly higher than their hopes nor humble yourself lower than their despair.
</p>
<p>
And if you would know God, be not therefore a solver of riddles.<br/>
Rather look about you and you shall see Him playing with your children.<br/>
And look into space; you shall see Him walking in the cloud, outstretching His arms in the lightning and descending in rain.<br/>
You shall see Him smiling in flowers, then rising and waving His hands in trees.

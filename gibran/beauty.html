<h1>The Prophet: On Beauty</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>And a poet said, Speak to us of Beauty.</p>
<p>And he answered:</p>
<p>
Where shall you seek beauty, and how shall you find her unless she herself be your way and your guide?<br/>
And how shall you speak of her except she be the weaver of your speech?
</p>
<p>
The aggrieved and the injured say, "Beauty is kind and gentle.<br/>
"Like a young mother half-shy of her own glory she walks among us."<br/>
And the passionate say, "Nay, beauty is a thing of might and dread.<br/>
"Like the tempest she shakes the earth beneath us and the sky above us."
</p>
<p>
The tired and the weary say, "Beauty is of soft whisperings.<br/>
"She speaks in our spirit.<br/>
"Her voice yields to our silences like a faint light that quivers in fear of the shadow."<br/>
But the restless say, "We have heard her shouting among the mountains,<br/>
"And with her cries came the sound of hoofs, and the beating of wings and the roaring of lions."
</p>
<p>
At night the watchmen of the city say, "Beauty shall rise with the dawn from the east."<br/>
And at noontide the toilers and the wayfarers say, "We have seen her leaning over the earth from the windows of the sunset."
</p>
<p>
In winter say the snow-bound, "She shall come with the spring leaping upon the hills."<br/>
And in the summer heat the reapers say, "We have seen her dancing with the autumn leaves, and we saw a drift of snow in her hair."<br/>
All these things have you said of beauty,<br/>
Yet in truth you spoke not of her but of needs unsatisfied,<br/>
And beauty is not a need but an ecstasy.<br/>
It is not a mouth thirsting nor an empty hand stretched forth,<br/>
But rather a heart inflamed and a soul enchanted.<br/>
It is not the image you would see nor the song you would hear,<br/>
But rather an image you see though you close your eyes and a song you hear though you shut your ears.<br/>
It is not the sap within the furrowed bark, nor a wing attached to a claw,<br/>
But rather a garden for ever in bloom and a flock of angels for ever in flight.
</p>
<p>
People of Orphalese, beauty is life when life unveils her holy face.<br/>
But you are life and you are the veil.<br/>
Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror.<br/>
But you are eternity and you are the mirror.

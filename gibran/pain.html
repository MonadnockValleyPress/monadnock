<h1>The Prophet: On Pain</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>And a woman spoke, saying, Tell us of Pain.</p>
<p>And he said:</p>
<p>
Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.<br/>
Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.<br/>
And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy;<br/>
And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields.<br/>
And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief.<br/>
Much of your pain is self-chosen.<br/>
It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.<br/>
Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquillity:<br/>
For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen,<br/>
And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears.

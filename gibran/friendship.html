<h1>The Prophet: On Friendship</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>And a youth said, Speak to us of Friendship.</p>
<p>And he answered, saying:</p>
<p>
Your friend is your needs answered.<br/>
He is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving.<br/>
And he is your board and your fireside.<br/>
For you come to him with your hunger, and you seek him for peace.
</p>
<p>
When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you with hold the "aye."<br/>
And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;<br/>
For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unclaimed.<br/>
When you part from your friend, you grieve not;<br/>
For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.<br/>
And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.<br/>
For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.
</p>
<p>
And let your best be for your friend.<br/>
If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.<br/>
For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?<br/>
Seek him always with hours to live.<br/>
For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.<br/>
And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.<br/>
For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.

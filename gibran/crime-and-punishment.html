<h1>The Prophet: On Crime and Punishment</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>Then one of the judges of the city stood forth and said, Speak to us of Crime and Punishment.</p>
<p>And he answered, saying:</p>
<p>
It is when your spirit goes wandering upon the wind,<br/>
That you, alone and unguarded, commit a wrong unto others and therefore unto yourself.<br/>
And for that wrong committed must you knock and wait a while unheeded at the gate of the blessed.
</p>
<p>
Like the ocean is your god-self;<br/>
It remains for ever undefiled.<br/>
And like the ether it lifts but the winged.<br/>
Even like the sun is your god-self;<br/>
It knows not the ways of the mole nor seeks it the holes of the serpent.<br/>
But your god-self dwells not alone in your being.<br/>
Much in you is still man, and much in you is not yet man,<br/>
But a shapeless pigmy that walks asleep in the mist searching for its own awakening.<br/>
And of the man in you would I now speak.<br/>
For it is he and not your god-self nor the pigmy in the mist that knows crime and the punishment of crime.
</p>
<p>
Oftentimes have I heard you speak of one who commits a wrong as though he were not one of you, but a stranger unto you and an intruder upon your world.<br/>
But I say that even as the holy and the righteous cannot rise beyond the highest which is in each one of you,<br/>
So the wicked and the weak cannot fall lower than the lowest which is in you also.<br/>
And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree,<br/>
So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.<br/>
Like a procession you walk together towards your god-self.
</p>
<p>
You are the way and the wayfarers.<br/>
And when one of you falls down he falls for those behind him, a caution against the stumbling stone.<br/>
Aye, and he falls for those ahead of him, who, though faster and surer of foot, yet removed not the stumbling stone.
</p>
<p>
And this also, though the word lie heavy upon your hearts:<br/>
The murdered is not unaccountable for his own murder,<br/>
And the robbed is not blameless in being robbed.<br/>
The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked,<br/>
And the white-handed is not clean in the doings of the felon.<br/>
Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured,<br/>
And still more often the condemned is the burden bearer for the guiltless and unblamed.<br/>
You cannot separate the just from the unjust and the good from the wicked;<br/>
For they stand together before the face of the sun even as the black thread and the white are woven together.<br/>
And when the black thread breaks, the weaver shall look into the whole cloth, and he shall examine the loom also.
</p>
<p>
If any of you would bring to judgment the unfaithful wife,<br/>
Let him also weigh the heart of her husband in scales, and measure his soul with measurements.<br/>
And let him who would lash the offender look unto the spirit of the offended.<br/>
And if any of you would punish in the name of righteousness and lay the axe unto the evil tree, let him see to its roots;<br/>
And verily he will find the roots of the good and the bad, the fruitful and the fruitless, all entwined together in the silent heart of the earth.<br/>
And you judges who would be just.<br/>
What judgment pronounce you upon him who though honest in the flesh yet is a thief in spirit?<br/>
What penalty lay you upon him who slays in the flesh yet is himself slain in the spirit?<br/>
And how prosecute you him who in action is a deceiver and an oppressor,<br/>
Yet who also is aggrieved and outraged?
</p>
<p>
And how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than their misdeeds?<br/>
Is not remorse the justice which is administered by that very law which you would fain serve?<br/>
Yet you cannot lay remorse upon the innocent nor lift it from the heart of the guilty.<br/>
Unbidden shall it call in the night, that men may wake and gaze upon themselves.<br/>
And you who would understand justice, how shall you unless you look upon all deeds in the fullness of light?<br/>
Only then shall you know that the erect and the fallen are but one man standing in twilight between the night of his pigmy-self and the day of his god self,<br/>
And that the corner-stone of the temple is not higher than the lowest stone in its foundation.

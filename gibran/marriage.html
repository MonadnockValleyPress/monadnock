<h1>The Prophet: On Marriage</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>Then Almitra spoke again and said, And what of Marriage, master?</p>
<p>And he answered saying:</p>
<p>
You were born together, and together you shall be for evermore.<br/>
You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days.<br/>
Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.<br/>
But let there be spaces in your togetherness.<br/>
And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.
</p>
<p>
Love one another, but make not a bond of love:<br/>
Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.<br/>
Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.<br/>
Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.<br/>
Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,<br/>
Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.
</p>
<p>
Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.<br/>
For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.<br/>
And stand together yet not too near together:<br/>
For the pillars of the temple stand apart,<br/>
And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.
</p>

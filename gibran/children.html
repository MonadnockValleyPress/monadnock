<h1>The Prophet: On Children</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children.</p>
<p>And he said:</p>
<p>
Your children are not your children.<br/>
They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.<br/>
They come through you but not from you,<br/>
And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.
</p>
<p>
You may give them your love but not your thoughts,<br/>
For they have their own thoughts.<br/>
You may house their bodies but not their souls,<br/>
For their souls dwell in the house of to-morrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.<br/>
You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.<br/>
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.<br/>
You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.<br/>
The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.<br/>
Let your bending in the Archer's hand be for gladness;<br/>
For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.

<h1>The Prophet: On Death</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>Then Almitra spoke, saying, We would ask now of Death.</p>
<p>And he said:</p>
<p>
You would know the secret of death.<br/>
But how shall you find it unless you seek it in the heart of life?<br/>
The owl whose night-bound eyes are blind unto the day cannot unveil the mystery of light.<br/>
If you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life.<br/>
For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one.
</p>
<p>
In the depth of your hopes and desires lies your silent knowledge of the beyond;<br/>
And like seeds dreaming beneath the snow your heart dreams of spring.<br/>
Trust the dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity.<br/>
Your fear of death is but the trembling of the shepherd when he stands before the king whose hand is to be laid upon him in honour.<br/>
Is the shepherd not joyful beneath his trembling, that he shall wear the mark of the king?<br/>
Yet is he not more mindful of his trembling?
</p>
<p>
For what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and to melt into the sun?<br/>
And what is it to cease breathing but to free the breath from its restless tides, that it may rise and expand and seek God unencumbered?
</p>
<p>
Only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing.<br/>
And when you have reached the mountain top, then you shall begin to climb.<br/>
And when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance.
</p>

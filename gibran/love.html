<h1>The Prophet: On Love</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>Then said Almitra, Speak to us of Love.</p>
<p>And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. And with a great voice he said:</p>
<p>
When love beckons to you, follow him,<br/>
Though his ways are hard and steep.<br/>
And when his wings enfold you yield to him,<br/>
Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.<br/>
And when he speaks to you believe in him,<br/>
Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.
</p>
<p>
For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.<br/>
Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.<br/>
Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun,<br/>
So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.<br/>
Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself.<br/>
He threshes you to make you naked.<br/>
He sifts you to free you from your husks.<br/>
He grinds you to whiteness.<br/>
He kneads you until you are pliant;<br/>
And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.
</p>
<p>
All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life's heart.
</p>
<p>
But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure,<br/>
Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing-floor,<br/>
Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.
</p>
<p>
Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.<br/>
Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;<br/>
For love is sufficient unto love.
</p>
<p>
When you love you should not say, "God is in my heart," but rather, "I am in the heart of God."<br/>
And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.
</p>
<p>
Love has no other desire but to fulfill itself.<br/>
But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:<br/>
To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.<br/>
To know the pain of too much tenderness.<br/>
To be wounded by your own understanding of love;<br/>
And to bleed willingly and joyfully.<br/>
To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;<br/>
To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;<br/>
To return home at eventide with gratitude;<br/>
And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.

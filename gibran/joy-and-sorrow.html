<h1>The Prophet: On Joy and Sorrow</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>Then a woman said, Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow.</p>
<p>And he answered:</p>
<p>
Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.<br/>
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.<br/>
And how else can it be?<br/>
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.<br/>
Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?<br/>
And is not the lute that soothes your spirit the very wood that was hollowed with knives?<br/>
When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.<br/>
When you are sorrowful, look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.
</p>
<p>
Some of you say, "Joy is greater than sorrow," and others say, "Nay, sorrow is the greater."<br/>
But I say unto you, they are inseparable.<br/>
Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.
</p>
<p>
Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.<br/>
Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.<br/>
When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.

<h1>The Prophet: On Good and Evil</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>And one of the elders of the city said, Speak to us of Good and Evil.</p>
<p>And he answered:</p>
<p>
Of the good in you I can speak, but not of the evil.<br/>
For what is evil but good tortured by its own hunger and thirst?<br/>
Verily when good is hungry it seeks food even in dark caves, and when it thirsts it drinks even of dead waters.
</p>
<p>
You are good when you are one with yourself.<br/>
Yet when you are not one with yourself you are not evil.<br/>
For a divided house is not a den of thieves; it is only a divided house.<br/>
And a ship without rudder may wander aimlessly among perilous isles yet sink not to the bottom.<br/>
You are good when you strive to give of yourself.<br/>
Yet you are not evil when you seek gain for yourself.<br/>
For when you strive for gain you are but a root that clings to the earth and sucks at her breast.<br/>
Surely the fruit cannot say to the root, "Be like me, ripe and full and ever giving of your abundance."<br/>
For to the fruit giving is a need, as receiving is a need to the root.
</p>
<p>
You are good when you are fully awake in your speech.<br/>
Yet you are not evil when you sleep while your tongue staggers without purpose.<br/>
And even stumbling speech may strengthen a weak tongue.
</p>
<p>
You are good when you walk to your goal firmly and with bold steps.<br/>
Yet you are not evil when you go thither limping.<br/>
Even those who limp go not backward.<br/>
But you who are strong and swift, see that you do not limp before the lame, deeming it kindness.
</p>
<p>
You are good in countless ways, and you are not evil when you are not good,<br/>
You are only loitering and sluggard.<br/>
Pity that the stags cannot teach swiftness to the turtles.
</p>
<p>
In your longing for your giant self lies your goodness: and that longing is in all of you.<br/>
But in some of you that longing is a torrent rushing with might to the sea, carrying the secrets of the hillsides and the songs of the forest.<br/>
And in others it is a flat stream that loses itself in angles and bends and lingers before it reaches the shore.<br/>
But let not him who longs much say to him who longs little, "Wherefore are you slow and halting?"<br/>
For the truly good ask not the naked, "Where is your garment?" nor the houseless, "What has befallen your house?"

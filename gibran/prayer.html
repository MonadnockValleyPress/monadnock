<h1>The Prophet: On Prayer</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>Then a priestess said, "Speak to us of Prayer."</p>
<p>And he answered, saying:</p>
<p>
You pray in your distress and in your need; would that you might pray also in the fullness of your joy and in your days of abundance.
</p>
<p>
For what is prayer but the expansion of your self into the living ether?<br/>
And if it is for your comfort to pour your darkness into space, it is also for your delight to pour forth the dawning of your heart.<br/>
And if you cannot but weep when your soul summons you to prayer, she should spur you again and yet again, though weeping, until you shall come laughing.<br/>
When you pray you rise to meet in the air those who are praying at that very hour, and whom save in prayer you may not meet.<br/>
Therefore let your visit to that temple invisible be for naught but ecstasy and sweet communion.<br/>
For if you should enter the temple for no other purpose than asking you shall not receive:<br/>
And if you should enter into it to humble yourself you shall not be lifted:<br/>
Or even if you should enter into it to beg for the good of others you shall not be heard.<br/>
It is enough that you enter the temple invisible.
</p>
<p>
I cannot teach you how to pray in words.<br/>
God listens not to your words save when He Himself utters them through your lips.<br/>
And I cannot teach you the prayer of the seas and the forests and the mountains.<br/>
But you who are born of the mountains and the forests and the seas can find their prayer in your heart,<br/>
And if you but listen in the stillness of the night you shall hear them saying in silence:<br/>
"Our God, who art our winged self, it is thy will in us that willeth.<br/>
"It is thy desire in us that desireth.<br/>
"It is thy urge in us that would turn our nights, which are thine, into days, which are thine also.<br/>
"We cannot ask thee for aught, for thou knowest our needs before they are born in us:<br/>
"Thou art our need; and in giving us more of thyself thou givest us all."

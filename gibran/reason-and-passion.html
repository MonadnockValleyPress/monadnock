<h1>The Prophet: On Reason and Passion</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>And the priestess spoke again and said: Speak to us of Reason and Passion.</p>
<p>And he answered, saying:</p>
<p>
Your soul is oftentimes a battlefield, upon which your reason and your judgment wage war against your passion and your appetite.<br/>
Would that I could be the peacemaker in your soul, that I might turn the discord and the rivalry of your elements into oneness and melody.<br/>
But how shall I, unless you yourselves be also the peacemakers, nay, the lovers of all your elements?
</p>
<p>
Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul.<br/>
If either your sails or your rudder be broken, you can but toss and drift, or else be held at a standstill in mid-seas.<br/>
For reason, ruling alone, is a force confining; and passion, unattended, is a flame that burns to its own destruction.<br/>
Therefore let your soul exalt your reason to the height of passion, that it may sing;<br/>
And let it direct your passion with reason, that your passion may livethrough its own daily resurrection, and like the phoenix rise above its own ashes.
</p>
<p>
I would have you consider your judgment and your appetite even as you would two loved guests in your house.<br/>
Surely you would not honour one guest above the other; for he who is more mindful of one loses the love and the faith of both.<br/>
Among the hills, when you sit in the cool shade of the white poplars, sharing the peace and serenity of distant fields and meadows &mdash; then let your heart say in silence, "God rests in reason."<br/>
And when the storm comes, and the mighty wind shakes the forest, and thunder and lightning proclaim the majesty of the sky, &mdash; then let your heart say in awe, "God moves in passion."<br/>
And since you are a breath in God's sphere, and a leaf in God's forest, you too should rest in reason and move in passion.

<h1>The Prophet: On Laws</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>Then a lawyer said, But what of our Laws, master?</p>
<p>And he answered:</p>
<p>
You delight in laying down laws,<br/>
Yet you delight more in breaking them.<br/>
Like children playing by the ocean who build sand-towers with constancy and then destroy them with laughter.<br/>
But while you build your sand-towers the ocean brings more sand to the shore,<br/>
And when you destroy them the ocean laughs with you.<br/>
Verily the ocean laughs always with the innocent.
</p>
<p>
But what of those to whom life is not an ocean, and man-made laws are not sand-towers,<br/>
But to whom life is a rock, and the law a chisel with which they would carve it in their own likeness?<br/>
What of the cripple who hates dancers?<br/>
What of the ox who loves his yoke and deems the elk and deer of the forest stray and vagrant things?<br/>
What of the old serpent who cannot shed his skin, and calls all others naked and shameless?<br/>
And of him who comes early to the wedding feast, and when over-fed and tired goes his way saying that all feasts are violation and all feasters law-breakers?
</p>
<p>
What shall I say of these save that they too stand in the sunlight, but with their backs to the sun?<br/>
They see only their shadows, and their shadows are their laws.<br/>
And what is the sun to them but a caster of shadows?<br/>
And what is it to acknowledge the laws but to stoop down and trace their shadows upon the earth?<br/>
But you who walk facing the sun, what images drawn on the earth can hold you?<br/>
You who travel with the wind, what weather vane shall direct your course?<br/>
What man's law shall bind you if you break your yoke but upon no man's prison door?<br/>
What laws shall you fear if you dance but stumble against no man's iron chains?<br/>
And who is he that shall bring you to judgment if you tear off your garment yet leave it in no man's path?<br/>
People of Orphalese, you can muffle the drum, and you can loosen the strings of the lyre, but who shall command the skylark not to sing?

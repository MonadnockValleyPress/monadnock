<h1>The Prophet: On Buying and Selling</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>And a merchant said, Speak to us of Buying and Selling.</p>
<p>And he answered and said:</p>
<p>
To you the earth yields her fruit, and you shall not want if you but know how to fill your hands.<br/>
It is in exchanging the gifts of the earth that you shall find abundance and be satisfied.<br/>
Yet unless the exchange be in love and kindly justice it will but lead some to greed and others to hunger.
</p>
<p>
When in the market-place you toilers of the sea and fields and vineyards meet the weavers and the potters and the gatherers of spices, &mdash; <br/>
Invoke then the master spirit of the earth, to come into your midst and sanctify the scales and the reckoning that weighs value against value.
</p>
<p>
And suffer not the barren-handed to take part in your transactions, who would sell their words for your labour.<br/>
To such men you should say:<br/>
"Come with us to the field, or go with our brothers to the sea and cast your net;<br/>
For the land and the sea shall be bountiful to you even as to us."
</p>
<p>
And if there come the singers and the dancers and the flute players, &mdash;  buy of their gifts also.<br/>
For they too are gatherers of fruit and frankincense, and that which they bring, though fashioned of dreams, is raiment and food for your soul.
</p>
<p>
And before you leave the market-place, see that no one has gone his way with empty hands.<br/>
For the master spirit of the earth shall not sleep peacefully upon the wind till the needs of the least of you are satisfied.
</p>

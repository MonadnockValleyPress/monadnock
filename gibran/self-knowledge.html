<h1>The Prophet: On Self-Knowledge</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>And a man said, Speak to us of Self-Knowledge.</p>
<p>And he answered, saying:</p>
<p>
Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.<br/>
But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart's knowledge.<br/>
You would know in words that which you have always known in thought.<br/>
You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.
</p>
<p>
And it is well you should.<br/>
The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea;<br/>
And the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.<br/>
But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;<br/>
And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.<br/>
For self is a sea boundless and measureless.
</p>
<p>
Say not, "I have found the truth," but rather, "I have found a truth."<br/>
Say not, "I have found the path of the soul." Say rather, "I have met the soul walking upon my path."<br/>
For the soul walks upon all paths.<br/>
The soul walks not upon a line, neither does it grow like a reed.<br/>
The soul unfolds itself, like a lotus of countless petals.

<h1>The Prophet: On Pleasure</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>Then a hermit, who visited the city once a year, came forth and said, Speak to us of Pleasure.</p>
<p>And he answered, saying:</p>
<p>
Pleasure is a freedom-song,<br/>
But it is not freedom.<br/>
It is the blossoming of your desires,<br/>
But it is not their fruit.<br/>
It is a depth calling unto a height,<br/>
But it is not the deep nor the high.<br/>
It is the caged taking wing,<br/>
But it is not space encompassed.<br/>
Aye, in very truth, pleasure is a freedom-song.<br/>
And I fain would have you sing it with fullness of heart; yet I would not have you lose your hearts in the singing.
</p>
<p>
Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, and they are judged and rebuked.<br/>
I would not judge nor rebuke them. I would have them seek.<br/>
For they shall find pleasure, but not her alone;<br/>
Seven are her sisters, and the least of them is more beautiful than pleasure.<br/>
Have you not heard of the man who was digging in the earth for roots and found a treasure?
</p>
<p>
And some of your elders remember pleasures with regret like wrongs committed in drunkenness.<br/>
But regret is the beclouding of the mind and not its chastisement.<br/>
They should remember their pleasures with gratitude, as they would the harvest of a summer.<br/>
Yet if it comforts them to regret, let them be comforted.
</p>
<p>
And there are among you those who are neither young to seek nor old to remember;<br/>
And in their fear of seeking and remembering they shun all pleasures, lest they neglect the spirit or offend against it.<br/>
But even in their foregoing is their pleasure.<br/>
And thus they too find a treasure though they dig for roots with quivering hands.<br/>
But tell me, who is he that can offend the spirit?<br/>
Shall the nightingale offend the stillness of the night, or the firefly the stars?<br/>
And shall your flame or your smoke burden the wind?<br/>
Think you the spirit is a still pool which you can trouble with a staff?
</p>
<p>
Oftentimes in denying yourself pleasure you do but store the desire in the recesses of your being.<br/>
Who knows but that which seems omitted to day, waits for to-morrow?<br/>
Even your body knows its heritage and its rightful need and will not be deceived.<br/>
And your body is the harp of your soul,<br/>
And it is yours to bring forth sweet music from it or confused sounds.
</p>
<p>
And now you ask in your heart, "How shall we distinguish that which is good in pleasure from that which is not good?"<br/>
Go to your fields and your gardens, and you shall learn that it is the pleasure of the bee to gather honey of the flower,<br/>
But it is also the pleasure of the flower to yield its honey to the bee.<br/>
For to the bee a flower is a fountain of life,<br/>
And to the flower a bee is a messenger of love,<br/>
And to both, bee and flower, the giving and the receiving of pleasure is a need and an ecstasy.
</p>
<p>
People of Orphalese, be in your pleasures like the flowers and the bees.

<h1>The Prophet: On Clothes</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>And the weaver said, Speak to us of Clothes.</p>
<p>And he answered:</p>
<p>
Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.<br/>
And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain.<br/>
Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment.<br/>
For the breath of life is in the sunlight and the hand of life is in the wind.
</p>
<p>
Some of you say, "It is the north wind who has woven the clothes we wear."<br/>
And I say, Aye, it was the north wind,<br/>
But shame was his loom, and the softening of the sinews was his thread.<br/>
And when his work was done he laughed in the forest.<br/>
Forget not that modesty is for a shield against the eye of the unclean.<br/>
And when the unclean shall be no more, what were modesty but a fetter and a fouling of the mind?<br/>
And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.

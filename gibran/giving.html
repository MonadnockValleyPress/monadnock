<h1>The Prophet: On Giving</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>Then said a rich man, Speak to us of Giving.</p>
<p>And he answered:</p>
<p>
You give but little when you give of your possessions.<br/>
It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.<br/>
For what are your possessions but things you keep and guard for fear you may need them to morrow?<br/>
And to-morrow, what shall to-morrow bring to the over-prudent dog burying bones in the trackless sand as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city?<br/>
And what is fear of need but need itself?<br/>
Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, the thirst that is unquenchable?<br/>
There are those who give little of the much which they have &mdash; and they give it for recognition and their hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome.<br/>
And there are those who have little and give it all.<br/>
These are the believers in life and the bounty of life, and their coffer is never empty.<br/>
There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward.<br/>
And there are those who give with pain, and that pain is their baptism.<br/>
And there are those who give and know not pain in giving, nor do they seek joy, nor give with mindfulness of virtue;<br/>
They give as in yonder valley the myrtle breathes its fragrance into space.<br/>
Through the hands of such as these God speaks, and from behind their eyes He smiles upon the earth.
</p>
<p>
It is well to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through understanding;<br/>
And to the open-handed the search for one who shall receive is joy greater than giving.<br/>
And is there aught you would withhold?<br/>
All you have shall some day be given;<br/>
Therefore give now, that the season of giving may be yours and not your inheritors'.
</p>
<p>
You often say, "I would give, but only to the deserving."<br/>
The trees in your orchard say not so, nor the flocks in your pasture.<br/>
They give that they may live, for to withhold is to perish.<br/>
Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and his nights is worthy of all else from you.<br/>
And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream.<br/>
And what desert greater shall there be, than that which lies in the courage and the confidence, nay the charity, of receiving?<br/>
And who are you that men should rend their bosom and unveil their pride, that you may see their worth naked and their pride unabashed?<br/>
See first that you yourself deserve to be a giver, and an instrument of giving.<br/>
For in truth it is life that gives unto life-while you, who deem yourself a giver, are but a witness.
</p>
<p>
And you receivers &mdash; and you are all receivers &mdash; assume no weight of gratitude, lest you lay a yoke upon yourself and upon him who gives.<br/>
Rather rise together with the giver on his gifts as on wings;<br/>
For to be overmindful of your debt is to doubt his generosity who has the free-hearted earth for mother, and God for father.

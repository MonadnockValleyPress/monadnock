<h1>The Prophet: On Talking</h1>
<h2>by Kahlil Gibran</h2>
<p>And then a scholar said, Speak of Talking.</p>
<p>And he answered, saying:</p>
<p>
You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts;<br/>
And when you can no longer dwell in the solitude of your heart you live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime.<br/>
And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered.  For thought is a bird of space, that in a cage of words may indeed unfold its wings but cannot fly.
</p>
<p>
There are those among you who seek the talkative through fear of being alone.<br/>
The silence of aloneness reveals to their eyes their naked selves and they would escape.<br/>
And there are those who talk, and without knowledge or forethought reveal a truth which they themselves do not understand.<br/>
And there are those who have the truth within them, but they tell it not in words.<br/>
In the bosom of such as these the spirit dwells in rhythmic silence.
</p>
<p>
When you meet your friend on the roadside or in the market-place, let the spirit in you move your lips and direct your tongue.<br/>
Let the voice within your voice speak to the ear of his ear;<br/>
For his soul will keep the truth of your heart as the taste of the wine is remembered.<br/>
When the color is forgotten and the vessel is no more.
</p>

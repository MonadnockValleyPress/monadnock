<h1>Our Singing Strength</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
It snowed in spring on earth so dry and warm<br/>
The flakes could find no landing place to form.<br/>
Hordes spent themselves to make it wet and cold,<br/>
And still they failed of any lasting hold.<br/>
They made no white impression on the black.<br/>
They disappeared as if earth sent them back.<br/>
Not till from separate flakes they changed at night<br/>
To almost strips and tapes of ragged white<br/>
Did grass and garden ground confess it snowed,<br/>
And all go back to winter but the road.<br/>
Next day the scene was piled and puffed and dead.<br/>
The grass lay flattened under one great tread.<br/>
Borne down until the end almost took root.<br/>
The rangey bough anticipated fruit<br/>
With snowballs cupped in every opening bud.<br/>
The road alone maintained itself in mud,<br/>
Whatever its secret was of greater heat<br/>
From inward fires or brush of passing feet.
</p>
<p>
In spring more mortal singers than belong<br/>
To any one place cover us with song.<br/>
Thrush, bluebird, blackbird, sparrow, and robin throng;<br/>
Some to go further north to Hudson's Bay,<br/>
Some that have come too far north back away,<br/>
Really a very few to build and stay.<br/>
Now was seen how these liked belated snow.<br/>
The fields had nowhere left for them to go;
</p>
<p>
They'd soon exhausted all there was in flying;<br/>
The trees they'd had enough of with once trying<br/>
And setting off their heavy powder load.<br/>
They could find nothing open but the road.<br/>
So there they let their lives be narrowed in<br/>
By thousands the bad weather made akin.<br/>
The road became a channel running flocks<br/>
Of glossy birds like ripples over rocks.<br/>
I drove them under foot in bits of flight<br/>
That kept the ground, almost disputing right<br/>
Of way with me from apathy of wing,<br/>
A talking twitter all they had to sing.<br/>
A few I must have driven to despair<br/>
Made quick asides, but having done in air<br/>
A whir among white branches great and small<br/>
As in some too much carven marble hall<br/>
Where one false wing beat would have brought down all,<br/>
Came tamely back in front of me, the Drover,<br/>
To suffer the same driven nightmare over.<br/>
One such storm in a lifetime couldn't teach them<br/>
That back behind pursuit it couldn't reach them;<br/>
None flew behind me to be left alone.
</p>
<p>
Well, something for a snowstorm to have shown<br/>
The country's singing strength thus brought together,<br/>
That though repressed and moody with the weather<br/>
Was none the less there ready to be freed<br/>
And sing the Wildflowers up from root and seed.

<h1>Wind and Window Flower</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
Lovers, forget your love,<br />
And list to the love of these,<br />
She a window flower,<br />
And he a winter breeze.<br />
When the frosty window veil<br />
Was melted down at noon,<br />
And the cag√®d yellow bird<br />
Hung over her in tune,<br />
He marked her through the pane,<br />
He could not help but mark,<br />
And only passed her by,<br />
To come again at dark.<br />
He was a winter wind,<br />
Concerned with ice and snow,<br />
Dead weeds and unmated birds,<br />
And little of love could know.<br />
But he sighed upon the sill,<br />
He gave the sash a shake,<br />
As witness all within<br />
Who lay that night awake.<br />
Perchance he half prevailed<br />
To win her for the flight<br />
From the firelit looking-glass<br />
And warm stove-window light.<br />
But the flower leaned aside<br />
And thought of naught to say,<br />
And morning found the breeze<br />
A hundred miles away.

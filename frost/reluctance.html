<h1>Reluctance</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
Out through the fields and the woods<br />
And over the walls I have wended;<br />
I have climbed the hills of view<br />
And looked at the world, and descended;<br />
I have come by the highway home,<br />
And lo, it is ended.<br />
The leaves are all dead on the ground,<br />
Save those that the oak is keeping<br />
To ravel them one by one<br />
And let them go scraping and creeping<br />
Out over the crusted snow,<br />
When others are sleeping.<br />
And the dead leaves lie huddled and still,<br />
No longer blown hither and thither;<br />
The last lone aster is gone;<br />
The flowers of the witch-hazel wither;<br />
The heart is still aching to seek,<br />
But the feet question 'Whither?'<br />
Ah, when to the heart of man<br />
Was it ever less than a treason<br />
To go with the drift of things,<br />
To yield with a grace to reason,<br />
And bow and accept and accept the end<br />
Of a love or a season?

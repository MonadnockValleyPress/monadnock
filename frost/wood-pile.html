<h1>The Wood-pile</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
Out walking in the frozen swamp one grey day<br />
I paused and said, "I will turn back from here.<br />
No, I will go on farther&mdash;and we shall see."<br />
The hard snow held me, save where now and then<br />
One foot went down. The view was all in lines<br />
Straight up and down of tall slim trees<br />
Too much alike to mark or name a place by<br />
So as to say for certain I was here<br />
Or somewhere else: I was just far from home.<br />
A small bird flew before me. He was careful<br />
To put a tree between us when he lighted,<br />
And say no word to tell me who he was<br />
Who was so foolish as to think what he thought.<br />
He thought that I was after him for a feather&mdash;<br />
The white one in his tail; like one who takes<br />
Everything said as personal to himself.<br />
One flight out sideways would have undeceived him.<br />
And then there was a pile of wood for which<br />
I forgot him and let his little fear<br />
Carry him off the way I might have gone,<br />
Without so much as wishing him good-night.<br />
He went behind it to make his last stand.<br />
It was a cord of maple, cut and split<br />
And piled&mdash;and measured, four by four by eight.<br />
And not another like it could I see.<br />
No runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.<br />
And it was older sure than this year's cutting,<br />
Or even last year's or the year's before.<br />
The wood was grey and the bark warping off it<br />
And the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis<br />
Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle.<br />
What held it though on one side was a tree<br />
Still growing, and on one a stake and prop,<br />
These latter about to fall. I thought that only<br />
Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks<br />
Could so forget his handiwork on which<br />
He spent himself, the labour of his axe,<br />
And leave it there far from a useful fireplace<br />
To warm the frozen swamp as best it could<br />
With the slow smokeless burning of decay.

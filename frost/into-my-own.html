<h1>Into My Own</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
One of my wishes is that those dark trees,<br />
So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,<br />
Were not, as 'twere, the merest mask of gloom,<br />
But stretched away unto the edge of doom.<br />
I should not be withheld but that some day<br />
Into their vastness I should steal away,<br />
Fearless of ever finding open land,<br />
Or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand.<br />
I do not see why I should e'er turn back,<br />
Or those should not set forth upon my track<br />
To overtake me, who should miss me here<br />
And long to know if still I held them dear.<br />
They would not find me changed from him they knew &mdash;<br />
Only more sure of all I thought was true.

<h1>The Sound of the Trees</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
I wonder about the trees.<br />
Why do we wish to bear<br />
Forever the noise of these<br />
More than another noise<br />
So close to our dwelling place?<br />
We suffer them by the day<br />
Till we lose all measure of pace,<br />
And fixity in our joys,<br />
And acquire a listening air.<br />
They are that that talks of going<br />
But never gets away;<br />
And that talks no less for knowing,<br />
As it grows wiser and older,<br />
That now it means to stay.<br />
My feet tug at the floor<br />
And my head sways to my shoulder<br />
Sometimes when I watch trees sway,<br />
From the window or the door.<br />
I shall set forth for somewhere,<br />
I shall make the reckless choice<br />
Some day when they are in voice<br />
And tossing so as to scare<br />
The white clouds over them on.<br />
I shall have less to say,<br />
But I shall be gone.

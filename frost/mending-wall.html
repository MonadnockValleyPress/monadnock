<h1>Mending Wall</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
Something there is that doesn't love a wall,<br />
That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,<br />
And spills the upper boulders in the sun;<br />
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.<br />
The work of hunters is another thing:<br />
I have come after them and made repair<br />
Where they have left not one stone on a stone,<br />
But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,<br />
To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,<br />
No one has seen them made or heard them made,<br />
But at spring mending-time we find them there.<br />
I let my neighbour know beyond the hill;<br />
And on a day we meet to walk the line<br />
And set the wall between us once again.<br />
We keep the wall between us as we go.<br />
To each the boulders that have fallen to each.<br />
And some are loaves and some so nearly balls<br />
We have to use a spell to make them balance:<br />
"Stay where you are until our backs are turned!"<br />
We wear our fingers rough with handling them.<br />
Oh, just another kind of out-door game,<br />
One on a side. It comes to little more:<br />
There where it is we do not need the wall:<br />
He is all pine and I am apple orchard.<br />
My apple trees will never get across<br />
And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.<br />
He only says, "Good fences make good neighbours."<br />
Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder<br />
If I could put a notion in his head:<br />
"Why do they make good neighbours? Isn't it<br />
Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.<br />
Before I built a wall I'd ask to know<br />
What I was walling in or walling out,<br />
And to whom I was like to give offence.<br />
Something there is that doesn't love a wall,<br />
That wants it down." I could say "Elves" to him,<br />
But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather<br />
He said it for himself. I see him there<br />
Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top<br />
In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.<br />
He moves in darkness as it seems to me,<br />
Not of woods only and the shade of trees.<br />
He will not go behind his father's saying,<br />
And he likes having thought of it so well<br />
He says again, "Good fences make good neighbours."

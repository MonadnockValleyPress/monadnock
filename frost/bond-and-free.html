<h1>Bond and Free</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
Love has earth to which she clings<br />
With hills and circling arms about&mdash;<br />
Wall within wall to shut fear out.<br />
But Thought has need of no such things,<br />
For Thought has a pair of dauntless wings.
</p>
<p>
On snow and sand and turf, I see<br />
Where Love has left a printed trace<br />
With straining in the world&#146;s embrace.<br />
And such is Love and glad to be.<br />
But Thought has shaken his ankles free.
</p>
<p>
Thought cleaves the interstellar gloom<br />
And sits in Sirius' disc all night,<br />
Till day makes him retrace his flight,<br />
With smell of burning on every plume,<br />
Back past the sun to an earthly room.
</p>
<p>
His gains in heaven are what they are.<br />
Yet some say Love by being thrall<br />
And simply staying possesses all<br />
In several beauty that Thought fares far<br />
To find fused in another star.

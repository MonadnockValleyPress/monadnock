<h1>The Flower Boat</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
The fisherman's swapping a yarn for a yarn<br/>
Under the hand of the village barber,<br/>
And here in the angle of house and barn<br/>
His deep-sea dory has found a harbor.
</p>
<p>
At anchor she rides the sunny sod,<br/>
As full to the gunnel of flowers growing<br/>
As ever she turned her home with cod<br/>
From George's bank when winds were blowing.
</p>
<p>
And I judge from that Elysian freight<br/>
That all they ask is rougher weather,<br/>
And dory and master will sail by fate<br/>
To seek the Happy Isles together.
</p>

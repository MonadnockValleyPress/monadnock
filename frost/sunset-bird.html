<h1>Looking for a Sunset Bird in Winter</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
The west was getting out of gold,<br/>
The breath of air had died of cold,<br/>
When shoeing home across the white,<br/>
I thought I saw a bird alight.
</p>
<p>
In summer when I passed the place<br/>
I had to stop and lift my face;<br/>
A bird with an angelic gift<br/>
Was singing in it sweet and swift.
</p>
<p>
No bird was singing in it now.<br/>
A single leaf was on a bough,<br/>
And that was all there was to see<br/>
In going twice around the tree.
</p>
<p>
From my advantage on a hill<br/>
I judged that such a crystal chill<br/>
Was only adding frost to snow<br/>
As gilt to gold that wouldn't show.
</p>
<p>
A brush had left a crooked stroke<br/>
Of what was either cloud or smoke<br/>
From north to south across the blue;<br/>
A piercing little star was through.

<h1>The Birthplace</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
Here further up the mountain slope<br/>
Than there was every any hope,<br/>
My father built, enclosed a spring,<br/>
Strung chains of wall round everything,<br/>
Subdued the growth of earth to grass,<br/>
And brought our various lives to pass.<br/>
A dozen girls and boys we were.<br/>
The mountain seemed to like the stir,<br/>
And made of us a little while&mdash;<br/>
With always something in her smile.<br/>
Today she wouldn't know our name.<br/>
(No girl's, of course, has stayed the same.)<br/>
The mountain pushed us off her knees.<br/>
And now her lap is full of trees.

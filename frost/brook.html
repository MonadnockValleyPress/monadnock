<h1>A Brook in the City</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
The farm house lingers, though averse to square<br/>
With the new city street it has to wear<br/>
A number in. But what about the brook<br/>
That held the house as in an elbow-crook?<br/>
I ask as one who knew the brook, its strength<br/>
And impulse, having dipped a finger length<br/>
And made it leap my knuckle, having tossed<br/>
A flower to try its currents where they crossed.<br/>
The meadow grass could be cemented down<br/>
From growing under pavements of a town;<br/>
The apple trees be sent to hearth-stone flame.<br/>
Is water wood to serve a brook the same?<br/>
How else dispose of an immortal force<br/>
No longer needed? Staunch it at its source<br/>
With cinder loads dumped down? The brook was thrown<br/>
Deep in a sewer dungeon under stone<br/>
In fetid darkness still to live and run&mdash;<br/>
And all for nothing it had ever done<br/>
Except forget to go in fear perhaps.<br/>
No one would know except for ancient maps<br/>
That such a brook ran water. But I wonder<br/>
If from its being kept forever under<br/>
The thoughts may not have risen that so keep<br/>
This new-built city from both work and sleep.

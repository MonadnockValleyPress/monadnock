<h1>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
Whose woods these are I think I know.<br/>
His house is in the village though;<br/>
He will not see me stopping here<br/>
To watch his woods fill up with snow.
</p>
<p>
My little horse must think it queer<br/>
To stop without a farmhouse near<br/>
Between the woods and frozen lake<br/>
The darkest evening of the year.
</p>
<p>
He gives his harness bells a shake<br/>
To ask if there is some mistake.<br/>
The only other sound's the sweep<br/>
Of easy wind and downy flake.
</p>
<p>
The woods are lovely, dark and deep.<br/>
But I have promises to keep,<br/>
And miles to go before I sleep,<br/>
And miles to go before I sleep.
</p>

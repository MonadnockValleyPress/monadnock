<h1>Misgiving</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
All crying "We will go with you, O Wind!"<br/>
The foliage follow him, leaf and stem;<br/>
But a sleep oppresses them as they go,<br/>
And they end by bidding him stay with them.
</p>
<p>
Since ever they flung abroad in spring<br/>
The leaves had promised themselves this flight,<br/>
Who now would fain seek sheltering wall,<br/>
Or thicket, or hollow place for the night.
</p>
<p>
And now they answer his summoning blast<br/>
With an ever vaguer and vaguer stir,<br/>
Or at utmost a little reluctant whirl<br/>
That drops them no further than where they were.
</p>
<p>
I only hope that when I am free<br/>
As they are free to go in quest<br/>
Of the knowledge beyond the bounds of life<br/>
It may not seem better to me to rest.

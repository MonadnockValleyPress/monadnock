<h1>A Winter Eden</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
A winter garden in an alder swamp,<br/>
Where conies now come out to sun and romp,<br/>
As near a paradise as it can be<br/>
And not melt snow or start a dormant tree.
</p>
<p>
It lifts existence on a plane of snow<br/>
One level higher than the earth below,<br/>
One level nearer heaven overhead,<br/>
And last year's berries shining scarlet red.
</p>
<p>
It lifts a gaunt luxuriating beast<br/>
Where he can stretch and hold his highest feast<br/>
On some wild apple-tree's young tender bark,<br/>
What well may prove the year's high girdle mark.
</p>
<p>
So near to paradise all pairing ends:<br/>
Here loveless birds now flock as winter friends,<br/>
Content with bud-inspecting. They presume<br/>
To say which buds are leaf and which are bloom.
</p>
<p>
A feather-hammer gives a double knock.<br/>
This Eden day is done at two o'clock.<br/>
An hour of winter day might seem too short<br/>
To make it worth life's while to wake and sport.

<h1>The Aim was Song</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
Before man came to blow it right<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind once blew itself untaught,<br/>
And did its loudest day and night<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any rough place where it caught.
</p>
<p>
Man came to tell it what was wrong:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hadn't found the place to blow;<br/>
It blew too hard&mdash;the aim was song.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And listen&mdash;how it ought to go!
</p>
<p>
He took a little in his mouth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And held it long enough for north<br/>
To be converted into south,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then by measure blew it forth.
</p>
<p>
By measure. It was word and note,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind the wind had meant to be&mdash;<br/>
A little through the lips and throat.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim was song&mdash;the wind could see.

<h1>Acquainted with the Night</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
I have been one acquainted with the night.<br/>
I have walked out in rain&mdash;and back in rain.<br/>
I have outwalked the furthest city light.
</p>
<p>
I have looked down the saddest city lane.<br/>
I have passed by the watchman on his beat<br/>
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.
</p>
<p>
I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet<br/>
When far away an interrupted cry<br/>
Came over houses from another street,
</p>
<p>
But not to call me back or say good-bye;<br/>
And further still at an unearthly height,<br/>
One luminary clock against the sky
</p>
<p>
Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.<br/>
I have been one acquainted with the night.

<h1>Hyla Brook</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
By June our brook's run out of song and speed.<br />
Sought for much after that, it will be found<br />
Either to have gone groping underground<br />
(And taken with it all the Hyla breed<br />
That shouted in the mist a month ago,<br />
Like ghost of sleigh-bells in a ghost of snow)&mdash;<br />
Or flourished and come up in jewel-weed,<br />
Weak foliage that is blown upon and bent<br />
Even against the way its waters went.<br />
Its bed is left a faded paper sheet<br />
Of dead leaves stuck together by the heat&mdash;<br />
A brook to none but who remember long.<br />
This as it will be seen is other far<br />
Than with brooks taken otherwhere in song.<br />
We love the things we love for what they are.<br />

<h1>A Minor Bird</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
I have wished a bird would fly away,<br/>
And not sing by my house all day;
</p>
<p>
Have clapped my hands at him from the door<br/>
When it seemed as if I could bear no more.
</p>
<p>
The fault must partly have been in me.<br/>
The bird was not to blame for his key.
</p>
<p>
And of course there must be something wrong<br/>
In wanting to silence any song.

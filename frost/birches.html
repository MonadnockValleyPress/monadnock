<h1>Birches</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
When I see birches bend to left and right<br />
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,<br />
I like to think some boy's been swinging them.<br />
But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.<br />
Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them<br />
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning<br />
After a rain. They click upon themselves<br />
As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored<br />
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.<br />
Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells<br />
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust&mdash;<br />
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away<br />
You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.<br />
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,<br />
And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed<br />
So low for long, they never right themselves:<br />
You may see their trunks arching in the woods<br />
Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground<br />
Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair<br />
Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.<br />
But I was going to say when Truth broke in<br />
With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm<br />
(Now am I free to be poetical?)<br />
I should prefer to have some boy bend them<br />
As he went out and in to fetch the cows&mdash;<br />
Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,<br />
Whose only play was what he found himself,<br />
Summer or winter, and could play alone.<br />
One by one he subdued his father's trees<br />
By riding them down over and over again<br />
Until he took the stiffness out of them,<br />
And not one but hung limp, not one was left<br />
For him to conquer. He learned all there was<br />
To learn about not launching out too soon<br />
And so not carrying the tree away<br />
Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise<br />
To the top branches, climbing carefully<br />
With the same pains you use to fill a cup<br />
Up to the brim, and even above the brim.<br />
Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,<br />
Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.<br />
So was I once myself a swinger of birches.<br />
And so I dream of going back to be.<br />
It's when I'm weary of considerations,<br />
And life is too much like a pathless wood<br />
Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs<br />
Broken across it, and one eye is weeping<br />
From a twig's having lashed across it open.<br />
I'd like to get away from earth awhile<br />
And then come back to it and begin over.<br />
May no fate willfully misunderstand me<br />
And half grant what I wish and snatch me away<br />
Not to return. Earth's the right place for love:<br />
I don't know where it's likely to go better.<br />
I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,<br />
And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk<br />
<em>Toward</em> heaven, till the tree could bear no more,<br />
But dipped its top and set me down again.<br />
That would be good both going and coming back.<br />
One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.<br />

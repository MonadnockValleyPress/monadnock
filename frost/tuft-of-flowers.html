<h1>The Tuft of Flowers</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
I went to turn the grass once after one<br />
Who mowed it in the dew before the sun.<br />
The dew was gone that made his blade so keen<br />
Before I came to view the leveled scene.<br />
I looked for him behind an isle of trees;<br />
I listened for his whetstone on the breeze.<br />
But he had gone his way, the grass all mown,<br />
And I must be, as he had been, &mdash; alone,<br />
'As all must be,' I said within my heart,<br />
'Whether they work together or apart.'<br />
But as I said it, swift there passed me by<br />
On noiseless wing a 'wildered butterfly,<br />
Seeking with memories grown dim o'er night<br />
Some resting flower of yesterday's delight.<br />
And once I marked his flight go round and round,<br />
As where some flower lay withering on the ground.<br />
And then he flew as far as eye could see,<br />
And then on tremulous wing came back to me.<br />
I thought of questions that have no reply,<br />
And would have turned to toss the grass to dry;<br />
But he turned first, and led my eye to look<br />
At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook,<br />
A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared<br />
Beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared.<br />
I left my place to know them by their name,<br />
Finding them butterfly weed when I came.<br />
The mower in the dew had loved them thus,<br />
By leaving them to flourish, not for us,<br />
Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him.<br />
But from sheer morning gladness at the brim.<br />
The butterfly and I had lit upon,<br />
Nevertheless, a message from the dawn,<br />
That made me hear the wakening birds around,<br />
And hear his long scythe whispering to the ground,<br />
And feel a spirit kindred to my own;<br />
So that henceforth I worked no more alone;<br />
But glad with him, I worked as with his aid,<br />
And weary, sought at noon with him the shade;<br />
And dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech<br />
With one whose thought I had not hoped to reach.<br />
'Men work together,' I told him from the heart,<br />
'Whether they work together or apart.'

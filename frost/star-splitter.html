<h1>The Star-splitter</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
You know Orion always comes up sideways.<br/>
Throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains,<br/>
And rising on his hands, he looks in on me<br/>
Busy outdoors by lantern-light with something<br/>
I should have done by daylight, and indeed,<br/>
After the ground is frozen, I should have done<br/>
Before it froze, and a gust flings a handful<br/>
Of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney<br/>
To make fun of my way of doing things,<br/>
Or else fun of Orion's having caught me.<br/>
Has a man, I should like to ask, no rights<br/>
These forces are obliged to pay respect to?"<br/>
So Brad McLaughlin mingled reckless talk<br/>
Of heavenly stars with hugger-mugger farming,<br/>
Till having failed at hugger-mugger farming,<br/>
He burned his house down for the fire insurance<br/>
And spent the proceeds on a telescope<br/>
To satisfy a life-long curiosity<br/>
About our place among the infinities.
</p>
<p>
"What do you want with one of those blame things?"<br/>
I asked him well beforehand. "Don't you get one!"<br/>
"Don't call it blamed; there isn't anything<br/>
More blameless in the sense of being less<br/>
A weapon in our human fight," he said.<br/>
"I'll have one if I sell my farm to buy it."<br/>
There where he moved the rocks to plow the ground
</p>
<p>
And plowed between the rocks he couldn't move<br/>
Few farms changed hands; so rather than spend years<br/>
Trying to sell his farm and then not selling,<br/>
He burned his house down for the fire insurance<br/>
And bought the telescope with what it came to.<br/>
He had been heard to say by several:<br/>
"The best thing that we're put here for's to see;<br/>
The strongest thing that's given us to see with's<br/>
A telescope. Someone in every town<br/>
Seems to me owes it to the town to keep one.<br/>
In Littleton it may as well be me."<br/>
After such loose talk it was no surprise<br/>
When he did what he did and burned his house down.
</p>
<p>
Mean laughter went about the town that day<br/>
To let him know we weren't the least imposed on.<br/>
And he could wait&mdash;we'd see to him to-morrow.<br/>
But the first thing next morning we reflected<br/>
If one by one we counted people out<br/>
For the least sin, it wouldn't take us long<br/>
To get so we had no one left to live with.<br/>
For to be social is to be forgiving.<br/>
Our thief, the one who does our stealing from us,<br/>
We don't cut off from coming to church suppers,<br/>
But what we miss we go to him and ask for.<br/>
He promptly gives it back, that is if still<br/>
Uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed of.<br/>
It wouldn't do to be too hard on Brad<br/>
About his telescope. Beyond the age<br/>
Of being given one's gift for Christmas,<br/>
He had to take the best way he knew how<br/>
To find himself in one. Well, all we said was<br/>
He took a strange thing to be roguish over.
</p>
<p>
Some sympathy was wasted on the house,<br/>
A good old-timer dating back along;<br/>
But a house isn't sentient; the house<br/>
Didn't feel anything. And if it did,<br/>
Why not regard it as a sacrifice,<br/>
And an old-fashioned sacrifice by fire,<br/>
Instead of a new-fashioned one at auction?
</p>
<p>
Out of a house and so out of a farm<br/>
At one stroke (of a match), Brad had to turn<br/>
To earn a living on the Concord railroad,<br/>
As under-ticket-agent at a station<br/>
Where his job, when he wasn't selling tickets.<br/>
Was setting out up track and down, not plants<br/>
As on a farm, but planets, evening stars<br/>
That varied in their hue from red to green.
</p>
<p>
He got a good glass for six hundred dollars.<br/>
His new job gave him leisure for star-gazing.<br/>
Often he bid me come and have a look<br/>
Up the brass barrel, velvet black inside,<br/>
At a star quaking in the other end.<br/>
I recollect a night of broken clouds<br/>
And underfoot snow melted down to ice,<br/>
And melting further in the wind to mud.<br/>
Bradford and I had out the telescope.<br/>
We spread our two legs as we spread its three,<br/>
Pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it,<br/>
And standing at our leisure till the day broke,<br/>
Said some of the best things we ever said.<br/>
That telescope was christened the Star-splitter,
</p>
<p>
Because it didn't do a thing but split<br/>
A star in two or three the way you split<br/>
A globule of quicksilver in your hand<br/>
With one stroke of your finger in the middle.<br/>
It's a star-splitter if there ever was one<br/>
And ought to do some good if splitting stars<br/>
'Sa thing to be compared with splitting wood.
</p>
<p>
We've looked and looked, but after all where are we?<br/>
Do we know any better where we are,<br/>
And how it stands between the night to-night<br/>
And a man with a smoky lantern chimney?<br/>
How different from the way it ever stood?

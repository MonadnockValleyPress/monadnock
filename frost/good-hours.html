<h1>Good Hours</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
I had for my winter evening walk&mdash;<br />
No one at all with whom to talk,<br />
But I had the cottages in a row<br />
Up to their shining eyes in snow.<br />
And I thought I had the folk within:<br />
I had the sound of a violin;<br />
I had a glimpse through curtain laces<br />
Of youthful forms and youthful faces.<br />
I had such company outward bound.<br />
I went till there were no cottages found.<br />
I turned and repented, but coming back<br />
I saw no window but that was black.<br />
Over the snow my creaking feet<br />
Disturbed the slumbering village street<br />
Like profanation, by your leave,<br />
At ten o'clock of a winter eve.

<h1>What Fifty Said</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
When I was young my teachers were the old.<br/>
I gave up fire for form till I was cold.<br/>
I suffered like a metal being cast.<br/>
I went to school to age to learn the past.
</p>
<p>
Now when I am old my teachers are the young.<br/>
What can't be molded must be cracked and sprung.<br/>
I strain at lessons fit to start a suture.<br/>
I go to school to youth to learn the future.

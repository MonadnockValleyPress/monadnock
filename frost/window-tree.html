<h1>Tree at My Window</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
Tree at my window, window tree,<br/>
My sash is lowered when night comes on;<br/>
But let there never be curtain drawn<br/>
Between you and me.
</p>
<p>
Vague dream-head lifted out of the ground,<br/>
And thing next most diffuse to cloud,<br/>
Not all your light tongues talking aloud<br/>
Could be profound.
</p>
<p>
But, tree, I have seen you taken and tossed,<br/>
And if you have seen me when I slept,<br/>
You have seen me when I was taken and swept<br/>
And all but lost.
</p>
<p>
That day she put our heads together,<br/>
Fate had her imagination about her,<br/>
Your head so much concerned with outer,<br/>
Mine with inner, weather.

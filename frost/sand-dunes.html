<h1>The Sand Dunes</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
Sea waves are green and wet,<br/>
But up from where they die<br/>
Rise others vaster yet,<br/>
And those are brown and dry.
</p>
<p>
They are the sea made land<br/>
To come at the fisher town<br/>
And bury in solid sand<br/>
The men she could not drown.
</p>
<p>
She may know cove and cape,<br/>
But she does not know mankind<br/>
If by any change of shape<br/>
She hopes to cut off mind.
</p>
<p>
Men left her a ship to sink:<br/>
They can leave her a hut as well;<br/>
And be but more free to think<br/>
For the one more cast-off shell.
</p>

<h1>The Investment</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
Over back where they speak of life as staying<br/>
("You couldn’t call it living, for it ain't"),<br/>
There was an old, old house renewed with paint,<br/>
And in it a piano loudly playing.
</p>
<p>
Out in the plowed ground in the cold a digger,<br/>
Among unearthed potatoes standing still,<br/>
Was counting winter dinners, one a hill,<br/>
With half an ear to the piano’s vigor.
</p>
<p>
All that piano and new paint back there,<br/>
Was it some money suddenly come into?<br/>
Or some extravagance young love had been to?<br/>
Or old love on an impulse not to care&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Not to sink under being man and wife,<br/>
But get some color and music out of life?
</p>

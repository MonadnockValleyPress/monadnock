<h1>The Onset</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
Always the same, when on a fated night<br/>
At last the gathered snow lets down as white<br/>
As may be in dark woods, and with a song<br/>
It shall not make again all winter long<br/>
Of hissing on the yet uncovered ground,<br/>
I almost stumble looking up and round,<br/>
As one who overtaken by the end<br/>
Gives up his errand, and lets death descend<br/>
Upon him where he is, with nothing done<br/>
To evil, no important triumph won,<br/>
More than if life had never been begun.
</p>
<p>
Yet all the precedent is on my side:<br/>
I know that winter death has never tried<br/>
The earth but it has failed: the snow may heap<br/>
In long storms an undrifted four feet deep<br/>
As measured against maple, birch and oak,<br/>
It cannot check the peeper's silver croak;<br/>
And I shall see the snow all go down hill<br/>
In water of a slender April rill<br/>
That flashes tail through last year's withered brake<br/>
And dead weeds, like a disappearing snake.<br/>
Nothing will be left white but here a birch,<br/>
And there a clump of houses with a church.

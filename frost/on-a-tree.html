<h1>On a Tree Fallen Across the Road</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
The tree the tempest with a crash of wood<br/>
Throws down in front of us is not to bar<br/>
Our passage to our journey's end for good,<br/>
But just to ask us who we think we are
</p>
<p>
Insisting always on our own way so.<br/>
She likes to halt us in our runner tracks,<br/>
And make us get down in a foot of snow<br/>
Debating what to do without an axe.
</p>
<p>
And yet she knows obstruction is in vain:<br/>
We will not be put off the final goal<br/>
We have it hidden in us to attain,<br/>
Not though we have to seize earth by the pole
</p>
<p>
And, tired of aimless circling in one place,<br/>
Steer straight off after something into space.
</p>

<h3><a id='myown'></a>Into My Own</h3>
<p>
    One of my wishes is that those dark trees,<br />
    So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,<br />
    Were not, as 'twere, the merest mask of gloom,<br />
    But stretched away unto the edge of doom.<br />
    I should not be withheld but that some day<br />
    Into their vastness I should steal away,<br />
    Fearless of ever finding open land,<br />
    Or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand.<br />
    I do not see why I should e'er turn back,<br />
    Or those should not set forth upon my track<br />
    To overtake me, who should miss me here<br />
    And long to know if still I held them dear.<br />
    They would not find me changed from him they knew &#151;<br />
    Only more sure of all I thought was true.
</p>

<h3><a id='ghost'></a>Ghost House</h3>
<p>
    I dwell in a lonely house I know<br />
    That vanished many a summer ago,<br />
    And left no trace but the cellar walls,<br />
    And a cellar in which the daylight falls,<br />
    And the purple-stemmed wild raspberries grow.<br />
    O'er ruined fences the grape-vines shield<br />
    The woods come back to the mowing field;<br />
    The orchard tree has grown one copse<br />
    Of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops;<br />
    The footpath down to the well is healed.<br />
    I dwell with a strangely aching heart<br />
    In that vanished abode there far apart<br />
    On that disused and forgotten road<br />
    That has no dust-bath now for the toad.<br />
    Night comes; the black bats tumble and dart;<br />
    The whippoorwill is coming to shout<br />
    And hush and cluck and flutter about:<br />
    I hear him begin far enough away<br />
    Full many a time to say his say<br />
    Before he arrives to say it out.<br />
    It is under the small, dim, summer star.<br />
    I know not who these mute folk are<br />
    Who share the unlit place with me &#151;<br />
    Those stones out under the low-limbed tree<br />
    Doubtless bear names that the mosses mar.<br />
    They are tireless folk, but slow and sad,<br />
    Though two, close-keeping, are lass and lad, &#151;<br />
    With none among them that ever sings,<br />
    And yet, in view of how many things,<br />
    As sweet companions as might be had.
</p>

<h3><a id='november'></a>My November Guest</h3>
<p>
    My sorrow, when she's here with me,<br />
    Thinks these dark days of autumn rain<br />
    Are beautiful as days can be;<br />
    She loves the bare, the withered tree;<br />
    She walks the sodden pasture lane.<br />
    Her pleasure will not let me stay.<br />
    She talks and I am fain to list:<br />
    She's glad the birds are gone away,<br />
    She's glad her simple worsted gray<br />
    Is silver now with clinging mist.<br />
    The desolate, deserted trees,<br />
    The faded earth, the heavy sky,<br />
    The beauties she so truly sees,<br />
    She thinks I have no eye for these,<br />
    And vexes me for reason why.<br />
    Not yesterday I learned to know<br />
    The love of bare November days<br />
    Before the coming of the snow,<br />
    But it were vain to tell her so,<br />
    And they are better for her praise.
</p>

<h3><a id='love'></a>Love and a Question</h3>
<p>
    A stranger came to the door at eve,<br />
    And he spoke the bridegroom fair.<br />
    He bore a green-white stick in his hand,<br />
    And, for all burden, care.<br />
    He asked with the eyes more than the lips<br />
    For a shelter for the night,<br />
    And he turned and looked at the road afar<br />
    Without a window light.<br />
    The bridegroom came forth into the porch<br />
    With, 'Let us look at the sky,<br />
    And question what of the night to be,<br />
    Stranger, you and I.'<br />
    The woodbine leaves littered the yard,<br />
    The woodbine berries were blue,<br />
    Autumn, yes, winter was in the wind;<br />
    'Stranger, I wish I knew.'<br />
    Within, the bride in the dusk alone<br />
    Bent over the open fire,<br />
    Her face rose-red with the glowing coal<br />
    And the thought of the heart's desire.<br />
    The bridegroom looked at the weary road,<br />
    Yet saw but her within,<br />
    And wished her heart in a case of gold<br />
    And pinned with a silver pin.<br />
    The bridegroom thought it little to give<br />
    A dole of bread, a purse,<br />
    A heartfelt prayer for the poor of God,<br />
    Or for the rich a curse;<br />
    But whether or not a man was asked<br />
    To mar the love of two<br />
    By harboring woe in the bridal house,<br />
    The bridegroom wished he knew.
</p>

<h3><a id='walk'></a>A Late Walk</h3>
<p>
    When I go up through the mowing field,<br />
    The headless aftermath,<br />
    Smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew,<br />
    Half closes the garden path.<br />
    And when I come to the garden ground,<br />
    The whir of sober birds<br />
    Up from the tangle of withered weeds<br />
    Is sadder than any words.<br />
    A tree beside the wall stands bare,<br />
    But a leaf that lingered brown,<br />
    Disturbed, I doubt not, by my thought,<br />
    Comes softly rattling down.<br />
    I end not far from my going forth<br />
    By picking the faded blue<br />
    Of the last remaining aster flower<br />
    To carry again to you.
</p>

<h3><a id='stars'></a>Stars</h3>
<p>
    How countlessly they congregate<br />
    O'er our tumultuous snow,<br />
    Which flows in shapes as tall as trees<br />
    When wintry winds do blow! &#151;<br />
    As if with keenness for our fate,<br />
    Our faltering few steps on<br />
    To white rest, and a place of rest<br />
    Invisible at dawn, &#151;<br />
    And yet with neither love nor hate,<br />
    Those stars like some snow-white<br />
    Minerva's snow-white marble eyes<br />
    Without the gift of sight.
</p>

<h3><a id='storm'></a>Storm Fear</h3>
<p>
    When the wind works against us in the dark,<br />
    And pelts with snow<br />
    The lowest chamber window on the east,<br />
    And whispers with a sort of stifled bark,<br />
    The beast,<br />
    'Come out! Come out!' &#151; <br />
    It costs no inward struggle not to go,<br />
    Ah, no!<br />
    I count our strength,<br />
    Two and a child,<br />
    Those of us not asleep subdued to mark<br />
    How the cold creeps as the fire dies at length, &#151; <br />
    How drifts are piled,<br />
    Dooryard and road ungraded,<br />
    Till even the comforting barn grows far away<br />
    And my heart owns a doubt<br />
    Whether 'tis in us to arise with day<br />
    And save ourselves unaided.
</p>

<h3><a id='wind'></a>Wind and Window Flower</h3>
<p>
    Lovers, forget your love,<br />
    And list to the love of these,<br />
    She a window flower,<br />
    And he a winter breeze.<br />
    When the frosty window veil<br />
    Was melted down at noon,<br />
    And the cagèd yellow bird<br />
    Hung over her in tune,<br />
    He marked her through the pane,<br />
    He could not help but mark,<br />
    And only passed her by,<br />
    To come again at dark.<br />
    He was a winter wind,<br />
    Concerned with ice and snow,<br />
    Dead weeds and unmated birds,<br />
    And little of love could know.<br />
    But he sighed upon the sill,<br />
    He gave the sash a shake,<br />
    As witness all within<br />
    Who lay that night awake.<br />
    Perchance he half prevailed<br />
    To win her for the flight<br />
    From the firelit looking-glass<br />
    And warm stove-window light.<br />
    But the flower leaned aside<br />
    And thought of naught to say,<br />
    And morning found the breeze<br />
    A hundred miles away.
</p>

<h3><a id='thawing'></a>To the Thawing Wind</h3>
<p>
    Come with rain, O loud Southwester!<br />
    Bring the singer, bring the nester;<br />
    Give the buried flower a dream;<br />
    Make the settled snow-bank steam;<br />
    Find the brown beneath the white;<br />
    But whate'er you do to-night,<br />
    Bathe my window, make it flow,<br />
    Melt it as the ices go;<br />
    Melt the glass and leave the sticks<br />
    Like a hermit's crucifix;<br />
    Burst into my narrow stall;<br />
    Swing the picture on the wall;<br />
    Run the rattling pages o'er;<br />
    Scatter poems on the floor;<br />
    Turn the poet out of door.
</p>

<h3><a id='prayer'></a>A Prayer in Spring</h3>
<p>
    Oh, give us pleasure in the flowers to-day;<br />
    And give us not to think so far away<br />
    As the uncertain harvest; keep us here<br />
    All simply in the springing of the year.<br />
    Oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white,<br />
    Like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night;<br />
    And make us happy in the happy bees,<br />
    The swarm dilating round the perfect trees.<br />
    And make us happy in the darting bird<br />
    That suddenly above the bees is heard,<br />
    The meteor that thrusts in with needle bill,<br />
    And off a blossom in mid air stands still.<br />
    For this is love and nothing else is love,<br />
    The which it is reserved for God above<br />
    To sanctify to what far ends He will,<br />
    But which it only needs that we fulfil.
</p>

<h3><a id='flower'></a>Flower-gathering</h3>
<p>
    I left you in the morning,<br />
    And in the morning glow,<br />
    You walked a way beside me<br />
    To make me sad to go.<br />
    Do you know me in the gloaming,<br />
    Gaunt and dusty grey with roaming?<br />
    Are you dumb because you know me not,<br />
    Or dumb because you know?<br />
    All for me? And not a question<br />
    For the faded flowers gay<br />
    That could take me from beside you<br />
    For the ages of a day?<br />
    They are yours, and be the measure<br />
    Of their worth for you to treasure,<br />
    The measure of the little while<br />
    That I've been long away.
</p>

<h3><a id='pogonias'></a>Rose Pogonias</h3>
<p>
    A saturated meadow,<br />
    Sun-shaped and jewel-small,<br />
    A circle scarcely wider<br />
    Than the trees around were tall;<br />
    Where winds were quite excluded,<br />
    And the air was stifling sweet<br />
    With the breath of many flowers, &#151; <br />
    A temple of the heat.<br />
    There we bowed us in the burning,<br />
    As the sun's right worship is,<br />
    To pick where none could miss them<br />
    A thousand orchises;<br />
    For though the grass was scattered,<br />
    Yet every second spear<br />
    Seemed tipped with wings of color,<br />
    That tinged the atmosphere.<br />
    We raised a simple prayer<br />
    Before we left the spot,<br />
    That in the general mowing<br />
    That place might be forgot;<br />
    Or if not all so favoured,<br />
    Obtain such grace of hours,<br />
    That none should mow the grass there<br />
    While so confused with flowers.
</p>

<h3><a id='roses'></a>Asking for Roses</h3>
<p>
    A house that lacks, seemingly, mistress and master,<br />
    With doors that none but the wind ever closes,<br />
    Its floor all littered with glass and with plaster;<br />
    It stands in a garden of old-fashioned roses.<br />
    I pass by that way in the gloaming with Mary;<br />
    'I wonder,' I say, 'who the owner of those is.<br />
    'Oh, no one you know,' she answers me airy,<br />
    'But one we must ask if we want any roses.'<br />
    So we must join hands in the dew coming coldly<br />
    There in the hush of the wood that reposes,<br />
    And turn and go up to the open door boldly,<br />
    And knock to the echoes as beggars for roses.<br />
    'Pray, are you within there, Mistress Who-were-you?'<br />
    'Tis Mary that speaks and our errand discloses.<br />
    'Pray, are you within there? Bestir you, bestir you!<br />
    'Tis summer again; there's two come for roses.<br />
    'A word with you, that of the singer recalling &#151; <br />
    Old Herrick: a saying that every maid knows is<br />
    A flower unplucked is but left to the falling,<br />
    And nothing is gained by not gathering roses.'<br />
    We do not loosen our hands' intertwining<br />
    (Not caring so very much what she supposes),<br />
    There when she comes on us mistily shining<br />
    And grants us by silence the boon of her roses.
</p>

<h3><a id='waiting'></a>Waiting Afield at Dusk</h3>
<p>
    What things for dream there are when spectre-like,<br />
    Moving among tall haycocks lightly piled,<br />
    I enter alone upon the stubble field,<br />
    From which the laborers' voices late have died,<br />
    And in the antiphony of afterglow<br />
    And rising full moon, sit me down<br />
    Upon the full moon's side of the first haycock<br />
    And lose myself amid so many alike.<br />
    I dream upon the opposing lights of the hour,<br />
    Preventing shadow until the moon prevail;<br />
    I dream upon the night-hawks peopling heaven,<br />
    Each circling each with vague unearthly cry,<br />
    Or plunging headlong with fierce twang afar;<br />
    And on the bat's mute antics, who would seem<br />
    Dimly to have made out my secret place,<br />
    Only to lose it when he pirouettes,<br />
    And seek it endlessly with purblind haste;<br />
    On the last swallow's sweep; and on the rasp<br />
    In the abyss of odor and rustle at my back,<br />
    That, silenced by my advent, finds once more,<br />
    After an interval, his instrument,<br />
    And tries once &#151; twice &#151; and thrice if I be there;<br />
    And on the worn book of old-golden song<br />
    I brought not here to read, it seems, but hold<br />
    And freshen in this air of withering sweetness;<br />
    But on the memory of one absent most,<br />
    For whom these lines when they shall greet her eye.
</p>

<h3><a id='vale'></a>In a Vale</h3>
<p>
    When I was young, we dwelt in a vale<br />
    By a misty fen that rang all night,<br />
    And thus it was the maidens pale<br />
    I knew so well, whose garments trail<br />
    Across the reeds to a window light.<br />
    The fen had every kind of bloom,<br />
    And for every kind there was a face,<br />
    And a voice that has sounded in my room<br />
    Across the sill from the outer gloom.<br />
    Each came singly unto her place,<br />
    But all came every night with the mist;<br />
    And often they brought so much to say<br />
    Of things of moment to which, they wist,<br />
    One so lonely was fain to list,<br />
    That the stars were almost faded away<br />
    Before the last went, heavy with dew,<br />
    Back to the place from which she came &#151; <br />
    Where the bird was before it flew,<br />
    Where the flower was before it grew,<br />
    Where bird and flower were one and the same.<br />
    And thus it is I know so well<br />
    Why the flower has odor, the bird has song.<br />
    You have only to ask me, and I can tell.<br />
    No, not vainly there did I dwell,<br />
    Nor vainly listen all the night long.
</p>

<h3><a id='dream'></a>A Dream Pang</h3>
<p>
    I had withdrawn in forest, and my song<br />
    Was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway;<br />
    And to the forest edge you came one day<br />
    (This was my dream) and looked and pondered long,<br />
    But did not enter, though the wish was strong:<br />
    You shook your pensive head as who should say,<br />
    'I dare not &#151; too far in his footsteps stray &#151; <br />
    He must seek me would he undo the wrong.<br />
    Not far, but near, I stood and saw it all<br />
    Behind low boughs the trees let down outside;<br />
    And the sweet pang it cost me not to call<br />
    And tell you that I saw does still abide.<br />
    But 'tis not true that thus I dwelt aloof,<br />
    For the wood wakes, and you are here for proof.
</p>

<h3><a id='neglect'></a>In Neglect</h3>
<p>
    They leave us so to the way we took,<br />
    As two in whom they were proved mistaken,<br />
    That we sit sometimes in the wayside nook,<br />
    With mischievous, vagrant, seraphic look,<br />
    And try if we cannot feel forsaken.
</p>

<h3><a id='vantage'></a>The Vantage Point</h3>
<p>
    If tired of trees I seek again mankind,<br />
    Well I know where to hie me &#151; in the dawn,<br />
    To a slope where the cattle keep the lawn.<br />
    There amid lolling juniper reclined,<br />
    Myself unseen, I see in white defined<br />
    Far off the homes of men, and farther still,<br />
    The graves of men on an opposing hill,<br />
    Living or dead, whichever are to mind.<br />
    And if by moon I have too much of these,<br />
    I have but to turn on my arm, and lo,<br />
    The sun-burned hillside sets my face aglow,<br />
    My breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze,<br />
    I smell the earth, I smell the bruisèd plant,<br />
    I look into the crater of the ant.
</p>

<h3><a id='mowing'></a>Mowing</h3>
<p>
    There was never a sound beside the wood but one,<br />
    And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground.<br />
    What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself;<br />
    Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,<br />
    Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound &#151; <br />
    And that was why it whispered and did not speak.<br />
    It was no dream of the gift of idle hours,<br />
    Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf:<br />
    Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak<br />
    To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows,<br />
    Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers<br />
    (Pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake.<br />
    The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows.<br />
    My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make.
</p>

<h3><a id='water'></a>Going for Water</h3>
<p>
    The well was dry beside the door,<br />
    And so we went with pail and can<br />
    Across the fields behind the house<br />
    To seek the brook if still it ran;<br />
    Not loth to have excuse to go,<br />
    Because the autumn eve was fair<br />
    (Though chill), because the fields were ours,<br />
    And by the brook our woods were there.<br />
    We ran as if to meet the moon<br />
    That slowly dawned behind the trees,<br />
    The barren boughs without the leaves,<br />
    Without the birds, without the breeze.<br />
    But once within the wood, we paused<br />
    Like gnomes that hid us from the moon,<br />
    Ready to run to hiding new<br />
    With laughter when she found us soon.<br />
    Each laid on other a staying hand<br />
    To listen ere we dared to look,<br />
    And in the hush we joined to make<br />
    We heard, we knew we heard the brook.<br />
    A note as from a single place,<br />
    A slender tinkling fall that made<br />
    Now drops that floated on the pool<br />
    Like pearls, and now a silver blade.
</p>

<h3><a id='revelation'></a>Revelation</h3>
<p>
    We make ourselves a place apart<br />
    Behind light words that tease and flout,<br />
    But oh, the agitated heart<br />
    Till someone find us really out.<br />
    'Tis pity if the case require<br />
    (Or so we say) that in the end<br />
    We speak the literal to inspire<br />
    The understanding of a friend.<br />
    But so with all, from babes that play<br />
    At hide-and-seek to God afar,<br />
    So all who hide too well away<br />
    Must speak and tell us where they are.
</p>

<h3><a id='trial'></a>The Trial by Existence</h3>
<p>
    Even the bravest that are slain<br />
    Shall not dissemble their surprise<br />
    On waking to find valor reign,<br />
    Even as on earth, in paradise;<br />
    And where they sought without the sword<br />
    Wide fields of asphodel fore'er,<br />
    To find that the utmost reward<br />
    Of daring should be still to dare.<br />
    The light of heaven falls whole and white<br />
    And is not shattered into dyes,<br />
    The light for ever is morning light;<br />
    The hills are verdured pasture-wise;<br />
    The angel hosts with freshness go,<br />
    And seek with laughter what to brave; &#151; <br />
    And binding all is the hushed snow<br />
    Of the far-distant breaking wave.<br />
    And from a cliff-top is proclaimed<br />
    The gathering of the souls for birth,<br />
    The trial by existence named,<br />
    The obscuration upon earth.<br />
    And the slant spirits trooping by<br />
    In streams and cross- and counter-streams<br />
    Can but give ear to that sweet cry<br />
    For its suggestion of what dreams!<br />
    And the more loitering are turned<br />
    To view once more the sacrifice<br />
    Of those who for some good discerned<br />
    Will gladly give up paradise.<br />
    And a white shimmering concourse rolls<br />
    Toward the throne to witness there<br />
    The speeding of devoted souls<br />
    Which God makes his especial care.<br />
    And none are taken but who will,<br />
    Having first heard the life read out<br />
    That opens earthward, good and ill,<br />
    Beyond the shadow of a doubt;<br />
    And very beautifully God limns,<br />
    And tenderly, life's little dream,<br />
    But naught extenuates or dims,<br />
    Setting the thing that is supreme.<br />
    Nor is there wanting in the press<br />
    Some spirit to stand simply forth,<br />
    Heroic in its nakedness,<br />
    Against the uttermost of earth.<br />
    The tale of earth's unhonored things<br />
    Sounds nobler there than 'neath the sun;<br />
    And the mind whirls and the heart sings,<br />
    And a shout greets the daring one.<br />
    But always God speaks at the end:<br />
    'One thought in agony of strife<br />
    The bravest would have by for friend,<br />
    The memory that he chose the life;<br />
    But the pure fate to which you go<br />
    Admits no memory of choice,<br />
    Or the woe were not earthly woe<br />
    To which you give the assenting voice.'<br />
    And so the choice must be again,<br />
    But the last choice is still the same;<br />
    And the awe passes wonder then,<br />
    And a hush falls for all acclaim.<br />
    And God has taken a flower of gold<br />
    And broken it, and used therefrom<br />
    The mystic link to bind and hold<br />
    Spirit to matter till death come.<br />
    'Tis of the essence of life here,<br />
    Though we choose greatly, still to lack<br />
    The lasting memory at all clear,<br />
    That life has for us on the wrack<br />
    Nothing but what we somehow chose;<br />
    Thus are we wholly stripped of pride<br />
    In the pain that has but one close,<br />
    Bearing it crushed and mystified.

<h3><a id='sacrifice'></a>In Equal Sacrifice</h3>
<p>
    Thus of old the Douglas did:<br />
    He left his land as he was bid<br />
    With the royal heart of Robert the Bruce<br />
    In a golden case with a golden lid,<br />
    To carry the same to the Holy Land;<br />
    By which we see and understand<br />
    That that was the place to carry a heart<br />
    At loyalty and love's command,<br />
    And that was the case to carry it in.<br />
    The Douglas had not far to win<br />
    Before he came to the land of Spain,<br />
    Where long a holy war had been<br />
    Against the too-victorious Moor;<br />
    And there his courage could not endure<br />
    Not to strike a blow for God<br />
    Before he made his errand sure.<br />
    And ever it was intended so,<br />
    That a man for God should strike a blow,<br />
    No matter the heart he has in charge<br />
    For the Holy Land where hearts should go.<br />
    But when in battle the foe were met,<br />
    The Douglas found him sore beset,<br />
    With only strength of the fighting arm<br />
    For one more battle passage yet &#151; <br />
    And that as vain to save the day<br />
    As bring his body safe away &#151; <br />
    Only a signal deed to do<br />
    And a last sounding word to say.<br />
    The heart he wore in a golden chain<br />
    He swung and flung forth into the plain,<br />
    And followed it crying 'Heart or death!'<br />
    And fighting over it perished fain.<br />
    So may another do of right,<br />
    Give a heart to the hopeless fight,<br />
    The more of right the more he loves;<br />
    So may another redouble might<br />
    For a few swift gleams of the angry brand,<br />
    Scorning greatly not to demand<br />
    In equal sacrifice with his<br />
    The heart he bore to the Holy Land.

<h3><a id='tuft'></a>The Tuft of Flowers</h3>
<p>
    I went to turn the grass once after one<br />
    Who mowed it in the dew before the sun.<br />
    The dew was gone that made his blade so keen<br />
    Before I came to view the leveled scene.<br />
    I looked for him behind an isle of trees;<br />
    I listened for his whetstone on the breeze.<br />
    But he had gone his way, the grass all mown,<br />
    And I must be, as he had been, &#151; alone,<br />
    'As all must be,' I said within my heart,<br />
    'Whether they work together or apart.'<br />
    But as I said it, swift there passed me by<br />
    On noiseless wing a 'wildered butterfly,<br />
    Seeking with memories grown dim o'er night<br />
    Some resting flower of yesterday's delight.<br />
    And once I marked his flight go round and round,<br />
    As where some flower lay withering on the ground.<br />
    And then he flew as far as eye could see,<br />
    And then on tremulous wing came back to me.<br />
    I thought of questions that have no reply,<br />
    And would have turned to toss the grass to dry;<br />
    But he turned first, and led my eye to look<br />
    At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook,<br />
    A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared<br />
    Beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared.<br />
    I left my place to know them by their name,<br />
    Finding them butterfly weed when I came.<br />
    The mower in the dew had loved them thus,<br />
    By leaving them to flourish, not for us,<br />
    Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him.<br />
    But from sheer morning gladness at the brim.<br />
    The butterfly and I had lit upon,<br />
    Nevertheless, a message from the dawn,<br />
    That made me hear the wakening birds around,<br />
    And hear his long scythe whispering to the ground,<br />
    And feel a spirit kindred to my own;<br />
    So that henceforth I worked no more alone;<br />
    But glad with him, I worked as with his aid,<br />
    And weary, sought at noon with him the shade;<br />
    And dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech<br />
    With one whose thought I had not hoped to reach.<br />
    'Men work together,' I told him from the heart,<br />
    'Whether they work together or apart.'

<h3><a id='spoils'></a>Spoils of the Dead</h3>
<p>
    Two fairies it was<br />
    On a still summer day<br />
    Came forth in the woods<br />
    With the flowers to play.<br />
    The flowers they plucked<br />
    They cast on the ground<br />
    For others, and those<br />
    For still others they found.<br />
    Flower-guided it was<br />
    That they came as they ran<br />
    On something that lay<br />
    In the shape of a man.<br />
    The snow must have made<br />
    The feathery bed<br />
    When this one fell<br />
    On the sleep of the dead.<br />
    But the snow was gone<br />
    A long time ago,<br />
    And the body he wore<br />
    Nigh gone with the snow.<br />
    The fairies drew near<br />
    And keenly espied<br />
    A ring on his hand<br />
    And a chain at his side.<br />
    They knelt in the leaves<br />
    And eerily played<br />
    With the glittering things,<br />
    And were not afraid.<br />
    And when they went home<br />
    To hide in their burrow,<br />
    They took them along<br />
    To play with to-morrow.<br />
    When you came on death,<br />
    Did you not come flower-guided<br />
    Like the elves in the wood?<br />
    I remember that I did.<br />
    But I recognised death<br />
    With sorrow and dread,<br />
    And I hated and hate<br />
    The spoils of the dead.

<h3><a id='pan'></a>Pan with Us</h3>
<p>
    Pan came out of the woods one day, &#151; <br />
    His skin and his hair and his eyes were gray,<br />
    The gray of the moss of walls were they, &#151; <br />
    And stood in the sun and looked his fill<br />
    At wooded valley and wooded hill.<br />
    He stood in the zephyr, pipes in hand,<br />
    On a height of naked pasture land;<br />
    In all the country he did command<br />
    He saw no smoke and he saw no roof.<br />
    That was well! and he stamped a hoof.<br />
    His heart knew peace, for none came here<br />
    To this lean feeding save once a year<br />
    Someone to salt the half-wild steer,<br />
    Or homespun children with clicking pails<br />
    Who see no little they tell no tales.<br />
    He tossed his pipes, too hard to teach<br />
    A new-world song, far out of reach,<br />
    For a sylvan sign that the blue jay's screech<br />
    And the whimper of hawks beside the sun<br />
    Were music enough for him, for one.<br />
    Times were changed from what they were:<br />
    Such pipes kept less of power to stir<br />
    The fruited bough of the juniper<br />
    And the fragile bluets clustered there<br />
    Than the merest aimless breath of air.<br />
    They were pipes of pagan mirth,<br />
    And the world had found new terms of worth.<br />
    He laid him down on the sun-burned earth<br />
    And ravelled a flower and looked away &#151; <br />
    Play? Play? &#151; What should he play?
</p>

<h3><a id='laugh'></a>The Demiurge's Laugh</h3>
<p>
    It was far in the sameness of the wood;<br />
    I was running with joy on the Demon's trail,<br />
    Though I knew what I hunted was no true god.<br />
    It was just as the light was beginning to fail<br />
    That I suddenly heard &#151; all I needed to hear:<br />
    It has lasted me many and many a year.<br />
    The sound was behind me instead of before,<br />
    A sleepy sound, but mocking half,<br />
    As of one who utterly couldn't care.<br />
    The Demon arose from his wallow to laugh,<br />
    Brushing the dirt from his eye as he went;<br />
    And well I knew what the Demon meant.<br />
    I shall not forget how his laugh rang out.<br />
    I felt as a fool to have been so caught,<br />
    And checked my steps to make pretence<br />
    It was something among the leaves I sought<br />
    (Though doubtful whether he stayed to see).<br />
    Thereafter I sat me against a tree.
</p>

<h3><a id='windows'></a>Now Close the Windows</h3>
<p>
    Now close the windows and hush all the fields;<br />
    If the trees must, let them silently toss;<br />
    No bird is singing now, and if there is,<br />
    Be it my loss.<br />
    It will be long ere the marshes resume,<br />
    It will be long ere the earliest bird:<br />
    So close the windows and not hear the wind,<br />
    But see all wind-stirred.
</p>

<h3><a id='song'></a>A Line-storm Song</h3>
<p>
    The line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift,<br />
    The road is forlorn all day,<br />
    Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift,<br />
    And the hoof-prints vanish away.<br />
    The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,<br />
    Expend their bloom in vain.<br />
    Come over the hills and far with me,<br />
    And be my love in the rain.<br />
    The birds have less to say for themselves<br />
    In the wood-world's torn despair<br />
    Than now these numberless years the elves,<br />
    Although they are no less there:<br />
    All song of the woods is crushed like some<br />
    Wild, easily shattered rose.<br />
    Come, be my love in the wet woods; come,<br />
    Where the boughs rain when it blows.<br />
    There is the gale to urge behind<br />
    And bruit our singing down,<br />
    And the shallow waters aflutter with wind<br />
    From which to gather your gown.<br />
    What matter if we go clear to the west,<br />
    And come not through dry-shod?<br />
    For wilding brooch shall wet your breast<br />
    The rain-fresh goldenrod.<br />
    Oh, never this whelming east wind swells<br />
    But it seems like the sea's return<br />
    To the ancient lands where it left the shells<br />
    Before the age of the fern;<br />
    And it seems like the time when after doubt<br />
    Our love came back amain.<br />
    Oh, come forth into the storm and rout<br />
    And be my love in the rain.
</p>

<h3><a id='october'></a>October</h3>
<p>
    O hushed October morning mild,<br />
    Thy leaves have ripened to the fall;<br />
    To-morrow's wind, if it be wild,<br />
    Should waste them all.<br />
    The crows above the forest call;<br />
    To-morrow they may form and go.<br />
    O hushed October morning mild,<br />
    Begin the hours of this day slow,<br />
    Make the day seem to us less brief.<br />
    Hearts not averse to being beguiled,<br />
    Beguile us in the way you know;<br />
    Release one leaf at break of day;<br />
    At noon release another leaf;<br />
    One from our trees, one far away;<br />
    Retard the sun with gentle mist;<br />
    Enchant the land with amethyst.<br />
    Slow, slow!<br />
    For the grapes' sake, if they were all,<br />
    Whose leaves already are burnt with frost,<br />
    Whose clustered fruit must else be lost &#151; <br />
    For the grapes' sake along the wall.
</p>

<h3><a id='butterfly'></a>My Butterfly</h3>
<p>
    Thine emulous fond flowers are dead, too,<br />
    And the daft sun-assaulter, he<br />
    That frighted thee so oft, is fled or dead:<br />
    Save only me<br />
    (Nor is it sad to thee!)<br />
    Save only me<br />
    There is none left to mourn thee in the fields.<br />
    The gray grass is not dappled with the snow;<br />
    Its two banks have not shut upon the river;<br />
    But it is long ago &#151; <br />
    It seems forever &#151; <br />
    Since first I saw thee glance,<br />
    With all the dazzling other ones,<br />
    In airy dalliance,<br />
    Precipitate in love,<br />
    Tossed, tangled, whirled and whirled above,<br />
    Like a limp rose-wreath in a fairy dance.<br />
    When that was, the soft mist<br />
    Of my regret hung not on all the land,<br />
    And I was glad for thee,<br />
    And glad for me, I wist.<br />
    Thou didst not know, who tottered, wandering on high,<br />
    That fate had made thee for the pleasure of the wind,<br />
    With those great careless wings,<br />
    Nor yet did I.<br />
    And there were other things:<br />
    It seemed God let thee flutter from his gentle clasp:<br />
    Then fearful he had let thee win<br />
    Too far beyond him to be gathered in,<br />
    Snatched thee, o'er eager, with ungentle grasp.<br />
    Ah! I remember me<br />
    How once conspiracy was rife<br />
    Against my life &#151; <br />
    The languor of it and the dreaming fond;<br />
    Surging, the grasses dizzied me of thought,<br />
    The breeze three odors brought,<br />
    And a gem-flower waved in a wand!<br />
    Then when I was distraught<br />
    And could not speak,<br />
    Sidelong, full on my cheek,<br />
    What should that reckless zephyr fling<br />
    But the wild touch of thy dye-dusty wing!<br />
    I found that wing broken to-day!<br />
    For thou are dead, I said,<br />
    And the strange birds say.<br />
    I found it with the withered leaves<br />
    Under the eaves.
</p>

<h3><a id='reluctance'></a>Reluctance</h3>
<p>
    Out through the fields and the woods<br />
    And over the walls I have wended;<br />
    I have climbed the hills of view<br />
    And looked at the world, and descended;<br />
    I have come by the highway home,<br />
    And lo, it is ended.<br />
    The leaves are all dead on the ground,<br />
    Save those that the oak is keeping<br />
    To ravel them one by one<br />
    And let them go scraping and creeping<br />
    Out over the crusted snow,<br />
    When others are sleeping.<br />
    And the dead leaves lie huddled and still,<br />
    No longer blown hither and thither;<br />
    The last lone aster is gone;<br />
    The flowers of the witch-hazel wither;<br />
    The heart is still aching to seek,<br />
    But the feet question 'Whither?'<br />
    Ah, when to the heart of man<br />
    Was it ever less than a treason<br />
    To go with the drift of things,<br />
    To yield with a grace to reason,<br />
    And bow and accept and accept the end<br />
    Of a love or a season?

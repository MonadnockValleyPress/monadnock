<h1>The Last Mowing</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
There's a place called Faraway Meadow<br/>
We never shall mow in again,<br/>
Or such is the talk at the farmhouse:<br/>
The meadow is finished with men.<br/>
Then now is the chance for the flowers<br/>
That can't stand mowers and plowers.<br/>
It must be now, through, in season<br/>
Before the not mowing brings trees on,<br/>
Before trees, seeing the opening,<br/>
March into a shadowy claim.<br/>
The trees are all I'm afraid of,<br/>
That flowers can't bloom in the shade of;<br/>
It's no more men I'm afraid of;<br/>
The meadow is done with the tame.<br/>
The place for the moment is ours<br/>
For you, O tumultuous flowers,<br/>
To go to waste and go wild in,<br/>
All shapes and colors of flowers,<br/>
I needn't call you by name.

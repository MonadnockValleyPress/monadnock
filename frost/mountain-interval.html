<h3><a id='road'></a>The Road Not Taken</h3>

<p>
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br />
And sorry I could not travel both<br />
And be one traveler, long I stood<br />
And looked down one as far as I could<br />
To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br />
</p>

<p>
Then took the other, as just as fair,<br />
And having perhaps the better claim,<br />
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br />
Though as for that the passing there<br />
Had worn them really about the same,<br />
</p>

<p>
And both that morning equally lay<br />
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br />
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br />
I doubted if I should ever come back.<br />
</p>

<p>
I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I&#151;<br />
I took the one less traveled by,<br />
And that has made all the difference.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='christmas'></a>Christmas Trees</h3>

<p>
The city had withdrawn into itself<br />
And left at last the country to the country;<br />
When between whirls of snow not come to lie<br />
And whirls of foliage not yet laid, there drove<br />
A stranger to our yard, who looked the city,<br />
Yet did in country fashion in that there<br />
He sat and waited till he drew us out<br />
A-buttoning coats to ask him who he was.<br />
He proved to be the city come again<br />
To look for something it had left behind<br />
And could not do without and keep its Christmas.<br />
He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees;<br />
My woods&#151;the young fir balsams like a place<br />
Where houses all are churches and have spires.<br />
I hadn&#146;t thought of them as Christmas Trees.<br />
I doubt if I was tempted for a moment<br />
To sell them off their feet to go in cars<br />
And leave the slope behind the house all bare,<br />
Where the sun shines now no warmer than the moon.<br />
I&#146;d hate to have them know it if I was.<br />
Yet more I&#146;d hate to hold my trees except<br />
As others hold theirs or refuse for them,<br />
Beyond the time of profitable growth,<br />
The trial by market everything must come to.<br />
I dallied so much with the thought of selling.<br />
Then whether from mistaken courtesy<br />
And fear of seeming short of speech, or whether<br />
From hope of hearing good of what was mine,<br />
I said, &#147;There aren&#146;t enough to be worth while.&#148;<br />
&#147;I could soon tell how many they would cut,<br />
You let me look them over.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;You could look.<br />
But don&#146;t expect I&#146;m going to let you have them.&#148;<br />
Pasture they spring in, some in clumps too close<br />
That lop each other of boughs, but not a few<br />
Quite solitary and having equal boughs<br />
All round and round. The latter he nodded &#147;Yes&#148; to,<br />
Or paused to say beneath some lovelier one,<br />
With a buyer&#146;s moderation, &#147;That would do.&#148;<br />
I thought so too, but wasn&#146;t there to say so.<br />
We climbed the pasture on the south, crossed over,<br />
And came down on the north.<br />
He said, &#147;A thousand.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;A thousand Christmas trees!&#151;at what apiece?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
He felt some need of softening that to me:<br />
&#147;A thousand trees would come to thirty dollars.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
Then I was certain I had never meant<br />
To let him have them. Never show surprise!<br />
But thirty dollars seemed so small beside<br />
The extent of pasture I should strip, three cents<br />
(For that was all they figured out apiece),<br />
Three cents so small beside the dollar friends<br />
I should be writing to within the hour<br />
Would pay in cities for good trees like those,<br />
Regular vestry-trees whole Sunday Schools<br />
Could hang enough on to pick off enough.<br />
A thousand Christmas trees I didn&#146;t know I had!<br />
Worth three cents more to give away than sell,<br />
As may be shown by a simple calculation.<br />
Too bad I couldn&#146;t lay one in a letter.<br />
I can&#146;t help wishing I could send you one,<br />
In wishing you herewith a Merry Christmas.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='night'></a>An Old Man&#146;s Winter Night</h3>

<p>
All out of doors looked darkly in at him<br />
Through the thin frost, almost in separate stars,<br />
That gathers on the pane in empty rooms.<br />
What kept his eyes from giving back the gaze<br />
Was the lamp tilted near them in his hand.<br />
What kept him from remembering what it was<br />
That brought him to that creaking room was age.<br />
He stood with barrels round him&#151;at a loss.<br />
And having scared the cellar under him<br />
In clomping there, he scared it once again<br />
In clomping off;&#151;and scared the outer night,<br />
Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar<br />
Of trees and crack of branches, common things,<br />
But nothing so like beating on a box.<br />
A light he was to no one but himself<br />
Where now he sat, concerned with he knew what,<br />
A quiet light, and then not even that.<br />
He consigned to the moon, such as she was,<br />
So late-arising, to the broken moon<br />
As better than the sun in any case<br />
For such a charge, his snow upon the roof,<br />
His icicles along the wall to keep;<br />
And slept. The log that shifted with a jolt<br />
Once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,<br />
And eased his heavy breathing, but still slept.<br />
One aged man&#151;one man&#151;can&#146;t fill a house,<br />
A farm, a countryside, or if he can,<br />
It&#146;s thus he does it of a winter night.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='patch'></a>A Patch of Old Snow</h3>

<p>
There's a patch of old snow in a corner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That I should have guessed<br />
Was a blow-away paper the rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had brought to rest.<br />
</p>

<p>
It is speckled with grime as if<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Small print overspread it,<br />
The news of a day I&#146;ve forgotten&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I ever read it.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='home'></a>In the Home Stretch</h3>

<p>
She stood against the kitchen sink, and looked<br />
Over the sink out through a dusty window<br />
At weeds the water from the sink made tall.<br />
She wore her cape; her hat was in her hand.<br />
Behind her was confusion in the room,<br />
Of chairs turned upside down to sit like people<br />
In other chairs, and something, come to look,<br />
For every room a house has&#151;parlor, bed-room,<br />
And dining-room&#151;thrown pell-mell in the kitchen.<br />
And now and then a smudged, infernal face<br />
Looked in a door behind her and addressed<br />
Her back. She always answered without turning.<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Where will I put this walnut bureau, lady?&#148;<br />
&#147;Put it on top of something that&#146;s on top<br />
Of something else,&#148; she laughed. &#147;Oh, put it where<br />
You can to-night, and go. It&#146;s almost dark;<br />
You must be getting started back to town.&#148;<br />
Another blackened face thrust in and looked<br />
And smiled, and when she did not turn, spoke gently,<br />
&#147;What are you seeing out the window, <em>lady?&#148;</em><br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Never was I beladied so before.<br />
Would evidence of having been called lady<br />
More than so many times make me a lady<br />
In common law, I wonder.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;But I ask,<br />
What are you seeing out the window, lady?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;What I&#146;ll be seeing more of in the years<br />
To come as here I stand and go the round<br />
Of many plates with towels many times.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;And what is that? You only put me off.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Rank weeds that love the water from the dish-pan<br />
More than some women like the dish-pan, Joe;<br />
A little stretch of mowing-field for you;<br />
Not much of that until I come to woods<br />
That end all. And it&#146;s scarce enough to call<br />
A view.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;And yet you think you like it, dear?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;That&#146;s what you&#146;re so concerned to know! You hope<br />
I like it. Bang goes something big away<br />
Off there upstairs. The very tread of men<br />
As great as those is shattering to the frame<br />
Of such a little house. Once left alone,<br />
You and I, dear, will go with softer steps<br />
Up and down stairs and through the rooms, and none<br />
But sudden winds that snatch them from our hands<br />
Will ever slam the doors.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;I think you see<br />
More than you like to own to out that window.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;No; for besides the things I tell you of,<br />
I only see the years. They come and go<br />
In alternation with the weeds, the field,<br />
The wood.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;What kind of years?&#148;<br />
&#147;Why, latter years&#151;<br />
Different from early years.&#148;<br />
&#147;I see them, too.<br />
You didn&#146;t count them?&#148;<br />
&#147;No, the further off<br />
So ran together that I didn&#146;t try to.<br />
It can scarce be that they would be in number<br />
We&#146;d care to know, for we are not young now.<br />
And bang goes something else away off there.<br />
It sounds as if it were the men went down,<br />
And every crash meant one less to return<br />
To lighted city streets we, too, have known,<br />
But now are giving up for country darkness.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Come from that window where you see too much for me,<br />
And take a livelier view of things from here.<br />
They&#146;re going. Watch this husky swarming up<br />
Over the wheel into the sky-high seat,<br />
Lighting his pipe now, squinting down his nose<br />
At the flame burning downward as he sucks it.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;See how it makes his nose-side bright, a proof<br />
How dark it&#146;s getting. Can you tell what time<br />
It is by that? Or by the moon? The new moon!<br />
What shoulder did I see her over? Neither.<br />
A wire she is of silver, as new as we<br />
To everything. Her light won&#146;t last us long.<br />
It&#146;s something, though, to know we&#146;re going to have her<br />
Night after night and stronger every night<br />
To see us through our first two weeks. But, Joe,<br />
The stove! Before they go! Knock on the window;<br />
Ask them to help you get it on its feet.<br />
We stand here dreaming. Hurry! Call them back!&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;They&#146;re not gone yet.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;We&#146;ve got to have the stove,<br />
Whatever else we want for. And a light.<br />
Have we a piece of candle if the lamp<br />
And oil are buried out of reach?&#148;<br />
Again<br />
The house was full of tramping, and the dark,<br />
Door-filling men burst in and seized the stove.<br />
A cannon-mouth-like hole was in the wall,<br />
To which they set it true by eye; and then<br />
Came up the jointed stovepipe in their hands,<br />
So much too light and airy for their strength<br />
It almost seemed to come ballooning up,<br />
Slipping from clumsy clutches toward the ceiling.<br />
&#147;A fit!&#148; said one, and banged a stovepipe shoulder.<br />
&#147;It&#146;s good luck when you move in to begin<br />
With good luck with your stovepipe. Never mind,<br />
It&#146;s not so bad in the country, settled down,<br />
When people &#146;re getting on in life, You&#146;ll like it.&#148;<br />
Joe said: &#147;You big boys ought to find a farm,<br />
And make good farmers, and leave other fellows<br />
The city work to do. There&#146;s not enough<br />
For everybody as it is in there.&#148;<br />
&#147;God!&#148; one said wildly, and, when no one spoke:<br />
&#147;Say that to Jimmy here. He needs a farm.&#148;<br />
But Jimmy only made his jaw recede<br />
Fool-like, and rolled his eyes as if to say<br />
He saw himself a farmer. Then there was a French boy<br />
Who said with seriousness that made them laugh,<br />
&#147;Ma friend, you ain&#146;t know what it is you&#146;re ask.&#148;<br />
He doffed his cap and held it with both hands<br />
Across his chest to make as &#146;twere a bow:<br />
&#147;We&#146;re giving you our chances on de farm.&#148;<br />
And then they all turned to with deafening boots<br />
And put each other bodily out of the house.<br />
&#147;Goodby to them! We puzzle them. They think&#151;<br />
I don&#146;t know what they think we see in what<br />
They leave us to: that pasture slope that seems<br />
The back some farm presents us; and your woods<br />
To northward from your window at the sink,<br />
Waiting to steal a step on us whenever<br />
We drop our eyes or turn to other things,<br />
As in the game &#145;Ten-step&#146; the children play.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Good boys they seemed, and let them love the city.<br />
All they could say was &#145;God!&#146; when you proposed<br />
Their coming out and making useful farmers.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Did they make something lonesome go through you?<br />
It would take more than them to sicken you&#151;<br />
Us of our bargain. But they left us so<br />
As to our fate, like fools past reasoning with.<br />
They almost shook <em>me.&#148;</em><br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;It&#146;s all so much<br />
What we have always wanted, I confess<br />
It&#146;s seeming bad for a moment makes it seem<br />
Even worse still, and so on down, down, down.<br />
It&#146;s nothing; it&#146;s their leaving us at dusk.<br />
I never bore it well when people went.<br />
The first night after guests have gone, the house<br />
Seems haunted or exposed. I always take<br />
A personal interest in the locking up<br />
At bedtime; but the strangeness soon wears off.&#148;<br />
He fetched a dingy lantern from behind<br />
A door. &#147;There&#146;s that we didn&#146;t lose! And these!&#148;&#151;<br />
Some matches he unpocketed. &#147;For food&#151;<br />
The meals we&#146;ve had no one can take from us.<br />
I wish that everything on earth were just<br />
As certain as the meals we&#146;ve had. I wish<br />
The meals we haven&#146;t had were, anyway.<br />
What have you you know where to lay your hands on?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;The bread we bought in passing at the store.<br />
There&#146;s butter somewhere, too.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Let&#146;s rend the bread.<br />
I&#146;ll light the fire for company for you;<br />
You&#146;ll not have any other company<br />
Till Ed begins to get out on a Sunday<br />
To look us over and give us his idea<br />
Of what wants pruning, shingling, breaking up.<br />
He&#146;ll know what he would do if he were we,<br />
And all at once. He&#146;ll plan for us and plan<br />
To help us, but he&#146;ll take it out in planning.<br />
Well, you can set the table with the loaf.<br />
Let&#146;s see you find your loaf. I&#146;ll light the fire.<br />
I like chairs occupying other chairs<br />
Not offering a lady&#151;&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;There again, Joe!<br />
<em>You&#146;re tired.&#148;</em><br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;I&#146;m drunk-nonsensical tired out;<br />
Don&#146;t mind a word I say. It&#146;s a day&#146;s work<br />
To empty one house of all household goods<br />
And fill another with &#146;em fifteen miles away,<br />
Although you do no more than dump them down.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Dumped down in paradise we are and happy.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;It&#146;s all so much what I have always wanted,<br />
I can&#146;t believe it&#146;s what you wanted, too.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Shouldn&#146;t you like to know?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;I&#146;d like to know<br />
If it is what you wanted, then how much<br />
You wanted it for me.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;A troubled conscience!<br />
You don&#146;t want me to tell if <em>I</em> don&#146;t know.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;I don&#146;t want to find out what can&#146;t be known.<br />
</p>

<p>
But who first said the word to come?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;My dear,<br />
It&#146;s who first thought the thought. You&#146;re searching, Joe,<br />
For things that don&#146;t exist; I mean beginnings.<br />
Ends and beginnings&#151;there are no such things.<br />
There are only middles.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;What is this?&#148;<br />
&#147;This life?<br />
Our sitting here by lantern-light together<br />
Amid the wreckage of a former home?<br />
You won&#146;t deny the lantern isn&#146;t new.<br />
The stove is not, and you are not to me,<br />
Nor I to you.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Perhaps you never were?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;It would take me forever to recite<br />
All that&#146;s not new in where we find ourselves.<br />
New is a word for fools in towns who think<br />
Style upon style in dress and thought at last<br />
Must get somewhere. I&#146;ve heard you say as much.<br />
No, this is no beginning.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Then an end?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;End is a gloomy word.&#148;<br />
&#147;Is it too late<br />
To drag you out for just a good-night call<br />
On the old peach trees on the knoll to grope<br />
By starlight in the grass for a last peach<br />
The neighbors may not have taken as their right<br />
When the house wasn&#146;t lived in? I&#146;ve been looking:<br />
I doubt if they have left us many grapes.<br />
Before we set ourselves to right the house,<br />
The first thing in the morning, out we go<br />
To go the round of apple, cherry, peach,<br />
Pine, alder, pasture, mowing, well, and brook.<br />
All of a farm it is.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;I know this much:<br />
I&#146;m going to put you in your bed, if first<br />
I have to make you build it. Come, the light.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
When there was no more lantern in the kitchen,<br />
The fire got out through crannies in the stove<br />
And danced in yellow wrigglers on the ceiling,<br />
As much at home as if they&#146;d always danced there.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='telephone'></a>The Telephone</h3>
<p>
&#147;When I was just as far as I could walk<br />
From here to-day,<br />
There was an hour<br />
All still<br />
When leaning with my head against a flower<br />
I heard you talk.<br />
Don&#146;t say I didn&#146;t, for I heard you say&#151;<br />
You spoke from that flower on the window sill&#151;<br />
Do you remember what it was you said?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;First tell me what it was you thought you heard.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Having found the flower and driven a bee away,<br />
I leaned my head,<br />
And holding by the stalk,<br />
I listened and I thought I caught the word&#151;<br />
What was it? Did you call me by my name?<br />
Or did you say&#151;<br />
<em>Someone</em> said &#145;Come&#146;&#151;I heard it as I bowed.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;I may have thought as much, but not aloud.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Well, so I came.&#148;<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='meeting'></a>Meeting and Passing</h3>

<p>
As I went down the hill along the wall<br />
There was a gate I had leaned at for the view<br />
And had just turned from when I first saw you<br />
As you came up the hill. We met. But all<br />
We did that day was mingle great and small<br />
Footprints in summer dust as if we drew<br />
The figure of our being less than two<br />
But more than one as yet. Your parasol<br />
</p>

<p>
Pointed the decimal off with one deep thrust.<br />
And all the time we talked you seemed to see<br />
Something down there to smile at in the dust.<br />
(Oh, it was without prejudice to me!)<br />
Afterward I went past what you had passed<br />
Before we met and you what I had passed.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='hyla'></a>Hyla Brook</h3>

<p>
By June our brook&#146;s run out of song and speed.<br />
Sought for much after that, it will be found<br />
Either to have gone groping underground<br />
(And taken with it all the Hyla breed<br />
That shouted in the mist a month ago,<br />
Like ghost of sleigh-bells in a ghost of snow)&#151;<br />
Or flourished and come up in jewel-weed,<br />
Weak foliage that is blown upon and bent<br />
Even against the way its waters went.<br />
Its bed is left a faded paper sheet<br />
Of dead leaves stuck together by the heat&#151;<br />
A brook to none but who remember long.<br />
This as it will be seen is other far<br />
Than with brooks taken otherwhere in song.<br />
We love the things we love for what they are.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='bird'></a>The Oven Bird</h3>

<p>
There is a singer everyone has heard,<br />
Loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird,<br />
Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again.<br />
He says that leaves are old and that for flowers<br />
Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten.<br />
He says the early petal-fall is past<br />
When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers<br />
On sunny days a moment overcast;<br />
And comes that other fall we name the fall.<br />
He says the highway dust is over all.<br />
The bird would cease and be as other birds<br />
But that he knows in singing not to sing.<br />
The question that he frames in all but words<br />
Is what to make of a diminished thing.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='bond'></a>Bond and Free</h3>

<p>
Love has earth to which she clings<br />
With hills and circling arms about&#151;<br />
Wall within wall to shut fear out.<br />
But Thought has need of no such things,<br />
For Thought has a pair of dauntless wings.<br />
</p>

<p>
On snow and sand and turf, I see<br />
Where Love has left a printed trace<br />
With straining in the world&#146;s embrace.<br />
And such is Love and glad to be.<br />
But Thought has shaken his ankles free.<br />
</p>

<p>
Thought cleaves the interstellar gloom<br />
And sits in Sirius&#146; disc all night,<br />
Till day makes him retrace his flight,<br />
With smell of burning on every plume,<br />
Back past the sun to an earthly room.<br />
</p>

<p>
His gains in heaven are what they are.<br />
Yet some say Love by being thrall<br />
And simply staying possesses all<br />
In several beauty that Thought fares far<br />
To find fused in another star.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='birches'></a>Birches</h3>

<p>
When I see birches bend to left and right<br />
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,<br />
I like to think some boy&#146;s been swinging them.<br />
But swinging doesn&#146;t bend them down to stay.<br />
Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them<br />
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning<br />
After a rain. They click upon themselves<br />
As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored<br />
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.<br />
Soon the sun&#146;s warmth makes them shed crystal shells<br />
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust&#151;<br />
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away<br />
You&#146;d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.<br />
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,<br />
And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed<br />
So low for long, they never right themselves:<br />
You may see their trunks arching in the woods<br />
Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground<br />
Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair<br />
Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.<br />
But I was going to say when Truth broke in<br />
With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm<br />
(Now am I free to be poetical?)<br />
I should prefer to have some boy bend them<br />
As he went out and in to fetch the cows&#151;<br />
Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,<br />
Whose only play was what he found himself,<br />
Summer or winter, and could play alone.<br />
One by one he subdued his father&#146;s trees<br />
By riding them down over and over again<br />
Until he took the stiffness out of them,<br />
And not one but hung limp, not one was left<br />
For him to conquer. He learned all there was<br />
To learn about not launching out too soon<br />
And so not carrying the tree away<br />
Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise<br />
To the top branches, climbing carefully<br />
With the same pains you use to fill a cup<br />
Up to the brim, and even above the brim.<br />
Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,<br />
Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.<br />
So was I once myself a swinger of birches.<br />
And so I dream of going back to be.<br />
It&#146;s when I&#146;m weary of considerations,<br />
And life is too much like a pathless wood<br />
Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs<br />
Broken across it, and one eye is weeping<br />
From a twig&#146;s having lashed across it open.<br />
I&#146;d like to get away from earth awhile<br />
And then come back to it and begin over.<br />
May no fate willfully misunderstand me<br />
And half grant what I wish and snatch me away<br />
Not to return. Earth&#146;s the right place for love:<br />
I don&#146;t know where it&#146;s likely to go better.<br />
I&#146;d like to go by climbing a birch tree,<br />
And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk<br />
<em>Toward</em> heaven, till the tree could bear no more,<br />
But dipped its top and set me down again.<br />
That would be good both going and coming back.<br />
One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='pea'></a>Pea Brush</h3>

<p>
I walked down alone Sunday after church<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the place where John has been cutting trees<br />
To see for myself about the birch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He said I could have to bush my peas.<br />
</p>

<p>
The sun in the new-cut narrow gap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was hot enough for the first of May,<br />
And stifling hot with the odor of sap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;From stumps still bleeding their life away.<br />
</p>

<p>
The frogs that were peeping a thousand shrill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever the ground was low and wet,<br />
The minute they heard my step went still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To watch me and see what I came to get.<br />
</p>

<p>
Birch boughs enough piled everywhere!&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;All fresh and sound from the recent axe.<br />
Time someone came with cart and pair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And got them off the wild flower&#146;s backs.<br />
</p>

<p>
They might be good for garden things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To curl a little finger round,<br />
The same as you seize cat&#146;s-cradle strings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lift themselves up off the ground.<br />
</p>

<p>
Small good to anything growing wild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;They were crooking many a trillium<br />
That had budded before the boughs were piled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And since it was coming up had to come.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='seed'></a>Putting in the Seed</h3>

<p>
You come to fetch me from my work to-night<br />
When supper&#146;s on the table, and we&#146;ll see<br />
If I can leave off burying the white<br />
Soft petals fallen from the apple tree.<br />
(Soft petals, yes, but not so barren quite,<br />
Mingled with these, smooth bean and wrinkled pea;)<br />
And go along with you ere you lose sight<br />
Of what you came for and become like me,<br />
Slave to a springtime passion for the earth.<br />
How Love burns through the Putting in the Seed<br />
On through the watching for that early birth<br />
When, just as the soil tarnishes with weed,<br />
</p>

<p>
The sturdy seedling with arched body comes<br />
Shouldering its way and shedding the earth crumbs.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='talk'></a>A Time to Talk</h3>

<p>
When a friend calls to me from the road<br />
And slows his horse to a meaning walk,<br />
I don&#146;t stand still and look around<br />
On all the hills I haven&#146;t hoed,<br />
And shout from where I am, What is it?<br />
No, not as there is a time to talk.<br />
I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,<br />
Blade-end up and five feet tall,<br />
And plod: I go up to the stone wall<br />
For a friendly visit.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='cow'></a>The Cow in Apple Time</h3>

<p>
Something inspires the only cow of late<br />
To make no more of a wall than an open gate,<br />
And think no more of wall-builders than fools.<br />
Her face is flecked with pomace and she drools<br />
A cider syrup. Having tasted fruit,<br />
She scores a pasture withering to the root.<br />
She runs from tree to tree where lie and sweeten<br />
The windfalls spiked with stubble and worm-eaten.<br />
She leaves them bitten when she has to fly.<br />
She bellows on a knoll against the sky.<br />
Her udder shrivels and the milk goes dry.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='encounter'></a>An Encounter</h3>

<p>
Once on the kind of day called &#147;weather breeder,&#148;<br />
When the heat slowly hazes and the sun<br />
By its own power seems to be undone,<br />
I was half boring through, half climbing through<br />
A swamp of cedar. Choked with oil of cedar<br />
And scurf of plants, and weary and over-heated,<br />
And sorry I ever left the road I knew,<br />
I paused and rested on a sort of hook<br />
That had me by the coat as good as seated,<br />
And since there was no other way to look,<br />
Looked up toward heaven, and there against the blue,<br />
Stood over me a resurrected tree,<br />
A tree that had been down and raised again&#151;<br />
A barkless spectre. He had halted too,<br />
As if for fear of treading upon me.<br />
I saw the strange position of his hands&#151;<br />
Up at his shoulders, dragging yellow strands<br />
Of wire with something in it from men to men.<br />
&#147;You here?&#148; I said. &#147;Where aren&#146;t you nowadays<br />
And what&#146;s the news you carry&#151;if you know?<br />
And tell me where you&#146;re off for&#151;Montreal?<br />
Me? I&#146;m not off for anywhere at all.<br />
Sometimes I wander out of beaten ways<br />
Half looking for the orchid Calypso.&#148;<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='range'></a>Range-finding</h3>

<p>
The battle rent a cobweb diamond-strung<br />
And cut a flower beside a ground bird&#146;s nest<br />
Before it stained a single human breast.<br />
The stricken flower bent double and so hung.<br />
And still the bird revisited her young.<br />
A butterfly its fall had dispossessed<br />
A moment sought in air his flower of rest,<br />
Then lightly stooped to it and fluttering clung.<br />
</p>

<p>
On the bare upland pasture there had spread<br />
O&#146;ernight &#146;twixt mullein stalks a wheel of thread<br />
And straining cables wet with silver dew.<br />
A sudden passing bullet shook it dry.<br />
The indwelling spider ran to greet the fly,<br />
But finding nothing, sullenly withdrew.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='hillwife'></a>The Hill Wife</h3>

<p style='text-align: center; font-size: smaller'>LONELINESS<br/>(<em>Her Word</em>)</p>
<p>
One ought not to have to care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;So much as you and I<br />
Care when the birds come round the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To seem to say good-bye;<br />
</p>

<p>
Or care so much when they come back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With whatever it is they sing;<br />
The truth being we are as much<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Too glad for the one thing<br />
</p>

<p>
As we are too sad for the other here&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With birds that fill their breasts<br />
But with each other and themselves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And their built or driven nests.<br />
</p>

<p style='text-align: center; font-size: smaller'>HOUSE FEAR</p>
<p>
Always&#151;I tell you this they learned&#151;<br />
Always at night when they returned<br />
To the lonely house from far away<br />
To lamps unlighted and fire gone gray,<br />
They learned to rattle the lock and key<br />
To give whatever might chance to be<br />
Warning and time to be off in flight:<br />
And preferring the out- to the in-door night,<br />
They learned to leave the house-door wide<br />
Until they had lit the lamp inside.<br />
</p>

<p style='text-align: center; font-size: smaller'>THE SMILE<br />(<em>Her Word</em>)</p>
<p>
I didn&#146;t like the way he went away.<br />
That smile! It never came of being gay.<br />
Still he smiled&#151;did you see him?&#151;I was sure!<br />
Perhaps because we gave him only bread<br />
And the wretch knew from that that we were poor.<br />
Perhaps because he let us give instead<br />
Of seizing from us as he might have seized.<br />
Perhaps he mocked at us for being wed,<br />
Or being very young (and he was pleased<br />
To have a vision of us old and dead).<br />
I wonder how far down the road he&#146;s got.<br />
He&#146;s watching from the woods as like as not.<br />
</p>

<p style='text-align: center; font-size: smaller'>THE OFT-REPEATED DREAM</p>
<p>
She had no saying dark enough<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the dark pine that kept<br />
Forever trying the window-latch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the room where they slept.<br />
</p>

<p>
The tireless but ineffectual hands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That with every futile pass<br />
Made the great tree seem as a little bird<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the mystery of glass!<br />
</p>

<p>
It never had been inside the room,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And only one of the two<br />
Was afraid in an oft-repeated dream<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what the tree might do.<br />
</p>

<p style='text-align: center; font-size: smaller'>THE IMPULSE</p>
<p>
It was too lonely for her there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And too wild,<br />
And since there were but two of them,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And no child,<br />
</p>

<p>
And work was little in the house,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;She was free,<br />
And followed where he furrowed field,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or felled tree.<br />
</p>

<p>
She rested on a log and tossed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fresh chips,<br />
With a song only to herself<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;On her lips.<br />
</p>

<p>
And once she went to break a bough<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of black alder.<br />
She strayed so far she scarcely heard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;When he called her&#151;<br />
</p>

<p>
And didn&#146;t answer&#151;didn&#146;t speak&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or return.<br />
She stood, and then she ran and hid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fern.<br />
</p>

<p>
He never found her, though he looked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Everywhere,<br />
And he asked at her mother&#146;s house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was she there.<br />
</p>

<p>
Sudden and swift and light as that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The ties gave,<br />
And he learned of finalities<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the grave.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='bonfire'></a>The Bonfire</h3>

<p>
&#147;Oh, let&#146;s go up the hill and scare ourselves,<br />
As reckless as the best of them to-night,<br />
By setting fire to all the brush we piled<br />
With pitchy hands to wait for rain or snow.<br />
Oh, let&#146;s not wait for rain to make it safe.<br />
The pile is ours: we dragged it bough on bough<br />
Down dark converging paths between the pines.<br />
Let&#146;s not care what we do with it to-night.<br />
Divide it? No! But burn it as one pile<br />
The way we piled it. And let&#146;s be the talk<br />
Of people brought to windows by a light<br />
Thrown from somewhere against their wall-paper.<br />
Rouse them all, both the free and not so free<br />
With saying what they&#146;d like to do to us<br />
For what they&#146;d better wait till we have done.<br />
Let&#146;s all but bring to life this old volcano,<br />
If that is what the mountain ever was&#151;<br />
And scare ourselves. Let wild fire loose we will&#133;.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;And scare you too?&#148; the children said together.<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Why wouldn&#146;t it scare me to have a fire<br />
Begin in smudge with ropy smoke and know<br />
That still, if I repent, I may recall it,<br />
But in a moment not: a little spurt<br />
Of burning fatness, and then nothing but<br />
The fire itself can put it out, and that<br />
By burning out, and before it burns out<br />
It will have roared first and mixed sparks with stars,<br />
And sweeping round it with a flaming sword,<br />
Made the dim trees stand back in wider circle&#151;<br />
Done so much and I know not how much more<br />
I mean it shall not do if I can bind it.<br />
Well if it doesn&#146;t with its draft bring on<br />
A wind to blow in earnest from some quarter,<br />
As once it did with me upon an April.<br />
The breezes were so spent with winter blowing<br />
They seemed to fail the bluebirds under them<br />
Short of the perch their languid flight was toward;<br />
And my flame made a pinnacle to heaven<br />
As I walked once round it in possession.<br />
But the wind out of doors&#151;you know the saying.<br />
There came a gust. You used to think the trees<br />
Made wind by fanning since you never knew<br />
It blow but that you saw the trees in motion.<br />
Something or someone watching made that gust.<br />
It put the flame tip-down and dabbed the grass<br />
Of over-winter with the least tip-touch<br />
Your tongue gives salt or sugar in your hand.<br />
The place it reached to blackened instantly.<br />
The black was all there was by day-light,<br />
That and the merest curl of cigarette smoke&#151;<br />
And a flame slender as the hepaticas,<br />
Blood-root, and violets so soon to be now.<br />
But the black spread like black death on the ground,<br />
And I think the sky darkened with a cloud<br />
Like winter and evening coming on together.<br />
There were enough things to be thought of then.<br />
Where the field stretches toward the north<br />
And setting sun to Hyla brook, I gave it<br />
To flames without twice thinking, where it verges<br />
Upon the road, to flames too, though in fear<br />
They might find fuel there, in withered brake,<br />
Grass its full length, old silver golden-rod,<br />
And alder and grape vine entanglement,<br />
To leap the dusty deadline. For my own<br />
I took what front there was beside. I knelt<br />
And thrust hands in and held my face away.<br />
Fight such a fire by rubbing not by beating.<br />
A board is the best weapon if you have it.<br />
I had my coat. And oh, I knew, I knew,<br />
And said out loud, I couldn&#146;t bide the smother<br />
And heat so close in; but the thought of all<br />
The woods and town on fire by me, and all<br />
The town turned out to fight for me&#151;that held me.<br />
I trusted the brook barrier, but feared<br />
The road would fail; and on that side the fire<br />
Died not without a noise of crackling wood&#151;<br />
Of something more than tinder-grass and weed&#151;<br />
That brought me to my feet to hold it back<br />
By leaning back myself, as if the reins<br />
Were round my neck and I was at the plough.<br />
I won! But I&#146;m sure no one ever spread<br />
Another color over a tenth the space<br />
That I spread coal-black over in the time<br />
It took me. Neighbors coming home from town<br />
Couldn&#146;t believe that so much black had come there<br />
While they had backs turned, that it hadn&#146;t been there<br />
When they had passed an hour or so before<br />
Going the other way and they not seen it.<br />
They looked about for someone to have done it.<br />
But there was no one. I was somewhere wondering<br />
Where all my weariness had gone and why<br />
I walked so light on air in heavy shoes<br />
In spite of a scorched Fourth-of-July feeling.<br />
Why wouldn&#146;t I be scared remembering that?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;If it scares you, what will it do to us?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Scare you. But if you shrink from being scared,<br />
What would you say to war if it should come?<br />
That&#146;s what for reasons I should like to know&#151;<br />
If you can comfort me by any answer.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Oh, but war&#146;s not for children&#151;it&#146;s for men.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Now we are digging almost down to China.<br />
My dears, my dears, you thought that&#151;we all thought it.<br />
So your mistake was ours. Haven&#146;t you heard, though,<br />
About the ships where war has found them out<br />
At sea, about the towns where war has come<br />
Through opening clouds at night with droning speed<br />
Further o&#146;erhead than all but stars and angels,&#151;<br />
And children in the ships and in the towns?<br />
Haven&#146;t you heard what we have lived to learn?<br />
Nothing so new&#151;something we had forgotten:<br />
<em>War is for everyone, for children too.</em><br />
I wasn&#146;t going to tell you and I mustn&#146;t.<br />
The best way is to come up hill with me<br />
And have our fire and laugh and be afraid.&#148;<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='garden'></a>A Girl&#146;s Garden</h3>

<p>
A neighbor of mine in the village<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Likes to tell how one spring<br />
When she was a girl on the farm, she did<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A childlike thing.<br />
</p>

<p>
One day she asked her father<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To give her a garden plot<br />
To plant and tend and reap herself,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said, &#147;Why not?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
In casting about for a corner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of an idle bit<br />
Of walled-off ground where a shop had stood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said, &#147;Just it.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
And he said, &#147;That ought to make you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;An ideal one-girl farm,<br />
And give you a chance to put some strength<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;On your slim-jim arm.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
It was not enough of a garden,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her father said, to plough;<br />
So she had to work it all by hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But she don&#146;t mind now.<br />
</p>

<p>
She wheeled the dung in the wheelbarrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Along a stretch of road;<br />
But she always ran away and left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her not-nice load.<br />
</p>

<p>
And hid from anyone passing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then she begged the seed.<br />
She says she thinks she planted one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all things but weed.<br />
</p>

<p>
A hill each of potatoes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Radishes, lettuce, peas,<br />
Tomatoes, beets, beans, pumpkins, corn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And even fruit trees<br />
</p>

<p>
And yes, she has long mistrusted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That a cider apple tree<br />
In bearing there to-day is hers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or at least may be.<br />
</p>

<p>
Her crop was a miscellany<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;When all was said and done,<br />
A little bit of everything,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A great deal of none.<br />
</p>

<p>
<em>Now</em> when she sees in the village<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;How village things go,<br />
Just when it seems to come in right,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;She says, <em>&#147;I</em> know!<br />
</p>

<p>
It&#146;s as when I was a farmer&#151;&#151;&#148;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, never by way of advice!<br />
And she never sins by telling the tale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the same person twice.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='nest'></a>The Exposed Nest</h3>

<p>
You were forever finding some new play.<br />
So when I saw you down on hands and knees<br />
In the meadow, busy with the new-cut hay,<br />
Trying, I thought, to set it up on end,<br />
I went to show you how to make it stay,<br />
If that was your idea, against the breeze,<br />
And, if you asked me, even help pretend<br />
To make it root again and grow afresh.<br />
But &#146;twas no make-believe with you to-day,<br />
Nor was the grass itself your real concern,<br />
Though I found your hand full of wilted fern,<br />
Steel-bright June-grass, and blackening heads of clover.<br />
&#146;Twas a nest full of young birds on the ground<br />
The cutter-bar had just gone champing over<br />
(Miraculously without tasting flesh)<br />
And left defenseless to the heat and light.<br />
You wanted to restore them to their right<br />
Of something interposed between their sight<br />
And too much world at once&#151;could means be found.<br />
The way the nest-full every time we stirred<br />
Stood up to us as to a mother-bird<br />
Whose coming home has been too long deferred,<br />
Made me ask would the mother-bird return<br />
And care for them in such a change of scene<br />
And might our meddling make her more afraid.<br />
That was a thing we could not wait to learn.<br />
We saw the risk we took in doing good,<br />
But dared not spare to do the best we could<br />
Though harm should come of it; so built the screen<br />
You had begun, and gave them back their shade.<br />
All this to prove we cared. Why is there then<br />
No more to tell? We turned to other things.<br />
I haven&#146;t any memory&#151;have you?&#151;<br />
Of ever coming to the place again<br />
To see if the birds lived the first night through,<br />
And so at last to learn to use their wings.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='out'></a>&#147;Out, Out&#151;&#148;</h3>

<p>
The buzz-saw snarled and rattled in the yard<br />
And made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood,<br />
Sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it.<br />
And from there those that lifted eyes could count<br />
Five mountain ranges one behind the other<br />
Under the sunset far into Vermont.<br />
And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled,<br />
As it ran light, or had to bear a load.<br />
And nothing happened: day was all but done.<br />
Call it a day, I wish they might have said<br />
To please the boy by giving him the half hour<br />
That a boy counts so much when saved from work.<br />
His sister stood beside them in her apron<br />
To tell them &#147;Supper.&#148; At the word, the saw,<br />
As if to prove saws knew what supper meant,<br />
Leaped out at the boy&#146;s hand, or seemed to leap&#151;<br />
He must have given the hand. However it was,<br />
Neither refused the meeting. But the hand!<br />
The boy&#146;s first outcry was a rueful laugh,<br />
As he swung toward them holding up the hand<br />
Half in appeal, but half as if to keep<br />
The life from spilling. Then the boy saw all&#151;<br />
Since he was old enough to know, big boy<br />
Doing a man&#146;s work, though a child at heart&#151;<br />
He saw all spoiled. &#147;Don&#146;t let him cut my hand off&#151;<br />
The doctor, when he comes. Don&#146;t let him, sister!&#148;<br />
So. But the hand was gone already.<br />
The doctor put him in the dark of ether.<br />
He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath.<br />
And then&#151;the watcher at his pulse took fright.<br />
No one believed. They listened at his heart.<br />
Little&#151;less&#151;nothing!&#151;and that ended it.<br />
No more to build on there. And they, since they<br />
Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='descent'></a>Brown&#146;s Descent, or the Willy-nilly Slide</h3>

<p>
Brown lived at such a lofty farm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That everyone for miles could see<br />
His lantern when he did his chores<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In winter after half-past three.<br />
</p>

<p>
And many must have seen him make<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;His wild descent from there one night,<br />
&#146;Cross lots, &#146;cross walls, &#146;cross everything,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Describing rings of lantern light.<br />
</p>

<p>
Between the house and barn the gale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Got him by something he had on<br />
And blew him out on the icy crust<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That cased the world, and he was gone!<br />
</p>

<p>
Walls were all buried, trees were few:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw no stay unless he stove<br />
A hole in somewhere with his heel.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But though repeatedly he strove<br />
</p>

<p>
And stamped and said things to himself,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sometimes something seemed to yield,<br />
He gained no foothold, but pursued<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;His journey down from field to field.<br />
</p>

<p>
Sometimes he came with arms outspread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like wings, revolving in the scene<br />
Upon his longer axis, and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With no small dignity of mien.<br />
</p>

<p>
Faster or slower as he chanced,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting or standing as he chose,<br />
According as he feared to risk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;His neck, or thought to spare his clothes,<br />
</p>

<p>
He never let the lantern drop.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And some exclaimed who saw afar<br />
The figures he described with it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#148;I wonder what those signals are<br />
</p>

<p>
Brown makes at such an hour of night!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#146;s celebrating something strange.<br />
I wonder if he&#146;s sold his farm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or been made Master of the Grange.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
He reeled, he lurched, he bobbed, he checked;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell and made the lantern rattle<br />
(But saved the light from going out.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;So half-way down he fought the battle<br />
</p>

<p>
Incredulous of his own bad luck.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then becoming reconciled<br />
To everything, he gave it up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And came down like a coasting child.<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Well&#151;I&#151;be&#151;&#148; that was all he said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As standing in the river road,<br />
He looked back up the slippery slope<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Two miles it was) to his abode.<br />
</p>

<p>
Sometimes as an authority<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;On motor-cars, I&#146;m asked if I<br />
Should say our stock was petered out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is my sincere reply:<br />
</p>

<p>
Yankees are what they always were.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&#146;t think Brown ever gave up hope<br />
Of getting home again because<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn&#146;t climb that slippery slope;<br />
</p>

<p>
Or even thought of standing there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the January thaw<br />
Should take the polish off the crust.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed with grace to natural law,<br />
</p>

<p>
And then went round it on his feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;After the manner of our stock;<br />
Not much concerned for those to whom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;At that particular time o&#146;clock,<br />
</p>

<p>
It must have looked as if the course<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He steered was really straight away<br />
From that which he was headed for&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not much concerned for them, I say:<br />
</p>

<p>
No more so than became a man&#151;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>And</em> politician at odd seasons.<br />
I&#146;ve kept Brown standing in the cold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;While I invested him with reasons;<br />
</p>

<p>
But now he snapped his eyes three times;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then shook his lantern, saying, &#147;Ile&#146;s<br />
&#146;Bout out!&#148; and took the long way home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;By road, a matter of several miles.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='gum'></a>The Gum-gatherer</h3>

<p>
There overtook me and drew me in<br />
To his down-hill, early-morning stride,<br />
And set me five miles on my road<br />
Better than if he had had me ride,<br />
A man with a swinging bag for load<br />
And half the bag wound round his hand.<br />
We talked like barking above the din<br />
Of water we walked along beside.<br />
And for my telling him where I&#146;d been<br />
And where I lived in mountain land<br />
To be coming home the way I was,<br />
He told me a little about himself.<br />
He came from higher up in the pass<br />
Where the grist of the new-beginning brooks<br />
Is blocks split off the mountain mass&#151;<br />
And hopeless grist enough it looks<br />
Ever to grind to soil for grass.<br />
(The way it is will do for moss.)<br />
There he had built his stolen shack.<br />
It had to be a stolen shack<br />
Because of the fears of fire and loss<br />
That trouble the sleep of lumber folk:<br />
Visions of half the world burned black<br />
And the sun shrunken yellow in smoke.<br />
We know who when they come to town<br />
Bring berries under the wagon seat,<br />
Or a basket of eggs between their feet;<br />
What this man brought in a cotton sack<br />
Was gum, the gum of the mountain spruce.<br />
He showed me lumps of the scented stuff<br />
Like uncut jewels, dull and rough.<br />
It comes to market golden brown;<br />
But turns to pink between the teeth.<br />
</p>

<p>
I told him this is a pleasant life<br />
To set your breast to the bark of trees<br />
That all your days are dim beneath,<br />
And reaching up with a little knife,<br />
To loose the resin and take it down<br />
And bring it to market when you please.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='linegang'></a>The Line-gang</h3>

<p>
Here come the line-gang pioneering by.<br />
They throw a forest down less cut than broken.<br />
They plant dead trees for living, and the dead<br />
They string together with a living thread.<br />
They string an instrument against the sky<br />
Wherein words whether beaten out or spoken<br />
Will run as hushed as when they were a thought.<br />
But in no hush they string it: they go past<br />
With shouts afar to pull the cable taut,<br />
To hold it hard until they make it fast,<br />
To ease away&#151;they have it. With a laugh,<br />
An oath of towns that set the wild at naught<br />
They bring the telephone and telegraph.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='red'></a>The Vanishing Red</h3>

<p>
He is said to have been the last Red Man<br />
In Acton. And the Miller is said to have laughed&#151;<br />
If you like to call such a sound a laugh.<br />
But he gave no one else a laugher&#146;s license.<br />
For he turned suddenly grave as if to say,<br />
&#147;Whose business,&#151;if I take it on myself,<br />
Whose business&#151;but why talk round the barn?&#151;<br />
When it&#146;s just that I hold with getting a thing done with.&#148;<br />
You can&#146;t get back and see it as he saw it.<br />
It&#146;s too long a story to go into now.<br />
You&#146;d have to have been there and lived it.<br />
Then you wouldn&#146;t have looked on it as just a matter<br />
Of who began it between the two races.<br />
</p>

<p>
Some guttural exclamation of surprise<br />
The Red Man gave in poking about the mill<br />
Over the great big thumping shuffling mill-stone<br />
Disgusted the Miller physically as coming<br />
From one who had no right to be heard from.<br />
&#147;Come, John,&#148; he said, &#147;you want to see the wheel pit?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
He took him down below a cramping rafter,<br />
And showed him, through a manhole in the floor,<br />
The water in desperate straits like frantic fish,<br />
Salmon and sturgeon, lashing with their tails.<br />
Then he shut down the trap door with a ring in it<br />
That jangled even above the general noise,<br />
And came up stairs alone&#151;and gave that laugh,<br />
And said something to a man with a meal-sack<br />
That the man with the meal-sack didn&#146;t catch&#151;then.<br />
Oh, yes, he showed John the wheel pit all right.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='snow'></a>Snow</h3>

<p>
The three stood listening to a fresh access<br />
Of wind that caught against the house a moment,<br />
Gulped snow, and then blew free again&#151;the Coles<br />
Dressed, but dishevelled from some hours of sleep,<br />
Meserve belittled in the great skin coat he wore.<br />
</p>

<p>
Meserve was first to speak. He pointed backward<br />
Over his shoulder with his pipe-stem, saying,<br />
&#147;You can just see it glancing off the roof<br />
Making a great scroll upward toward the sky,<br />
Long enough for recording all our names on.&#151;<br />
I think I&#146;ll just call up my wife and tell her<br />
I&#146;m here&#151;so far&#151;and starting on again.<br />
I&#146;ll call her softly so that if she&#146;s wise<br />
And gone to sleep, she needn&#146;t wake to answer.&#148;<br />
Three times he barely stirred the bell, then listened.<br />
&#147;Why, Lett, still up? Lett, I&#146;m at Cole&#146;s. I&#146;m late.<br />
I called you up to say Good-night from here<br />
Before I went to say Good-morning there.&#151;<br />
I thought I would.&#151; I know, but, Lett&#151;I know&#151;<br />
I could, but what&#146;s the sense? The rest won&#146;t be<br />
So bad.&#151; Give me an hour for it.&#151; Ho, ho,<br />
Three hours to here! But that was all up hill;<br />
The rest is down.&#151; Why no, no, not a wallow:<br />
They kept their heads and took their time to it<br />
Like darlings, both of them. They&#146;re in the barn.&#151;<br />
My dear, I&#146;m coming just the same. I didn&#146;t<br />
Call you to ask you to invite me home.&#151;&#148;<br />
He lingered for some word she wouldn&#146;t say,<br />
Said it at last himself, &#147;Good-night,&#148; and then,<br />
Getting no answer, closed the telephone.<br />
The three stood in the lamplight round the table<br />
With lowered eyes a moment till he said,<br />
&#147;I&#146;ll just see how the horses are.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Yes, do,&#148;<br />
Both the Coles said together. Mrs. Cole<br />
Added: &#147;You can judge better after seeing.&#151;<br />
I want you here with me, Fred. Leave him here,<br />
Brother Meserve. You know to find your way<br />
Out through the shed.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;I guess I know my way,<br />
I guess I know where I can find my name<br />
Carved in the shed to tell me who I am<br />
If it don&#146;t tell me where I am. I used<br />
To play&#151;&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;You tend your horses and come back.<br />
Fred Cole, you&#146;re going to let him!&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Well, aren&#146;t you?<br />
How can you help yourself?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;I called him Brother.<br />
Why did I call him that?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;It&#146;s right enough.<br />
That&#146;s all you ever heard him called round here.<br />
He seems to have lost off his Christian name.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Christian enough I should call that myself.<br />
He took no notice, did he? Well, at least<br />
I didn&#146;t use it out of love of him,<br />
The dear knows. I detest the thought of him<br />
With his ten children under ten years old.<br />
I hate his wretched little Racker Sect,<br />
All&#146;s ever I heard of it, which isn&#146;t much.<br />
But that&#146;s not saying&#151;Look, Fred Cole, it&#146;s twelve,<br />
Isn&#146;t it, now? He&#146;s been here half an hour.<br />
He says he left the village store at nine.<br />
Three hours to do four miles&#151;a mile an hour<br />
Or not much better. Why, it doesn&#146;t seem<br />
As if a man could move that slow and move.<br />
Try to think what he did with all that time.<br />
And three miles more to go!&#148;<br />
&#147;Don&#146;t let him go.<br />
Stick to him, Helen. Make him answer you.<br />
That sort of man talks straight on all his life<br />
From the last thing he said himself, stone deaf<br />
To anything anyone else may say.<br />
I should have thought, though, you could make him hear you.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;What is he doing out a night like this?<br />
Why can&#146;t he stay at home?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;He had to preach.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;It&#146;s no night to be out.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;He may be small,<br />
He may be good, but one thing&#146;s sure, he&#146;s tough.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;And strong of stale tobacco.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;He&#146;ll pull through.&#146;<br />
&#147;You only say so. Not another house<br />
Or shelter to put into from this place<br />
To theirs. I&#146;m going to call his wife again.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Wait and he may. Let&#146;s see what he will do.<br />
Let&#146;s see if he will think of her again.<br />
But then I doubt he&#146;s thinking of himself<br />
He doesn&#146;t look on it as anything.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;He shan&#146;t go&#151;there!&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;It <em>is</em> a night, my dear.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;One thing: he didn&#146;t drag God into it.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;He don&#146;t consider it a case for God.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;You think so, do you? You don&#146;t know the kind.<br />
He&#146;s getting up a miracle this minute.<br />
Privately&#151;to himself, right now, he&#146;s thinking<br />
He&#146;ll make a case of it if he succeeds,<br />
But keep still if he fails.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Keep still all over.<br />
He&#146;ll be dead&#151;dead and buried.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Such a trouble!<br />
Not but I&#146;ve every reason not to care<br />
What happens to him if it only takes<br />
Some of the sanctimonious conceit<br />
Out of one of those pious scalawags.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Nonsense to that! You want to see him safe.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;You like the runt.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Don&#146;t you a little?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Well,<br />
I don&#146;t like what he&#146;s doing, which is what<br />
You like, and like him for.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Oh, yes you do.<br />
You like your fun as well as anyone;<br />
Only you women have to put these airs on<br />
To impress men. You&#146;ve got us so ashamed<br />
Of being men we can&#146;t look at a good fight<br />
Between two boys and not feel bound to stop it.<br />
Let the man freeze an ear or two, I say.&#151;<br />
He&#146;s here. I leave him all to you. Go in <br />
And save his life.&#151; All right, come in, Meserve.<br />
Sit down, sit down. How did you find the horses?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Fine, fine.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;And ready for some more? My wife here<br />
Says it won&#146;t do. You&#146;ve got to give it up.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Won&#146;t you to please me? Please! If I say please?<br />
Mr. Meserve, I&#146;ll leave it to <em>your</em> wife.<br />
What <em>did</em> your wife say on the telephone?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
Meserve seemed to heed nothing but the lamp<br />
Or something not far from it on the table.<br />
By straightening out and lifting a forefinger,<br />
He pointed with his hand from where it lay<br />
Like a white crumpled spider on his knee:<br />
&#147;That leaf there in your open book! It moved<br />
Just then, I thought. It&#146;s stood erect like that,<br />
There on the table, ever since I came,<br />
Trying to turn itself backward or forward,<br />
I&#146;ve had my eye on it to make out which;<br />
If forward, then it&#146;s with a friend&#146;s impatience&#151;<br />
You see I know&#151;to get you on to things<br />
It wants to see how you will take, if backward<br />
It&#146;s from regret for something you have passed<br />
And failed to see the good of. Never mind,<br />
Things must expect to come in front of us<br />
A many times&#151;I don&#146;t say just how many&#151;<br />
That varies with the things&#151;before we see them.<br />
One of the lies would make it out that nothing<br />
Ever presents itself before us twice.<br />
Where would we be at last if that were so?<br />
Our very life depends on everything&#146;s<br />
Recurring till we answer from within.<br />
The thousandth time may prove the charm.&#151; That leaf!<br />
It can&#146;t turn either way. It needs the wind&#146;s help.<br />
But the wind didn&#146;t move it if it moved.<br />
It moved itself. The wind&#146;s at naught in here.<br />
It couldn&#146;t stir so sensitively poised<br />
A thing as that. It couldn&#146;t reach the lamp<br />
To get a puff of black smoke from the flame,<br />
Or blow a rumple in the collie&#146;s coat.<br />
You make a little foursquare block of air,<br />
Quiet and light and warm, in spite of all<br />
The illimitable dark and cold and storm,<br />
And by so doing give these three, lamp, dog,<br />
And book-leaf, that keep near you, their repose;<br />
Though for all anyone can tell, repose<br />
May be the thing you haven&#146;t, yet you give it.<br />
So false it is that what we haven&#146;t we can&#146;t give;<br />
So false, that what we always say is true.<br />
I&#146;ll have to turn the leaf if no one else will.<br />
It won&#146;t lie down. Then let it stand. Who cares?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;I shouldn&#146;t want to hurry you, Meserve,<br />
But if you&#146;re going&#151; Say you&#146;ll stay, you know?<br />
But let me raise this curtain on a scene,<br />
And show you how it&#146;s piling up against you.<br />
You see the snow-white through the white of frost?<br />
Ask Helen how far up the sash it&#146;s climbed<br />
Since last we read the gage.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;It looks as if<br />
Some pallid thing had squashed its features flat<br />
And its eyes shut with overeagerness<br />
To see what people found so interesting<br />
In one another, and had gone to sleep<br />
Of its own stupid lack of understanding,<br />
Or broken its white neck of mushroom stuff<br />
Short off, and died against the window-pane.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Brother Meserve, take care, you&#146;ll scare yourself<br />
More than you will us with such nightmare talk.<br />
It&#146;s you it matters to, because it&#146;s you<br />
Who have to go out into it alone.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Let him talk, Helen, and perhaps he&#146;ll stay.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Before you drop the curtain&#151;I&#146;m reminded:<br />
You recollect the boy who came out here<br />
To breathe the air one winter&#151;had a room<br />
Down at the Averys&#146;? Well, one sunny morning<br />
After a downy storm, he passed our place<br />
And found me banking up the house with snow.<br />
And I was burrowing in deep for warmth,<br />
Piling it well above the window-sills.<br />
The snow against the window caught his eye.<br />
&#145;Hey, that&#146;s a pretty thought&#146;&#151;those were his words.<br />
&#145;So you can think it&#146;s six feet deep outside,<br />
While you sit warm and read up balanced rations.<br />
You can&#146;t get too much winter in the winter.&#146;<br />
Those were his words. And he went home and all<br />
But banked the daylight out of Avery&#146;s windows.<br />
Now you and I would go to no such length.<br />
At the same time you can&#146;t deny it makes<br />
It not a mite worse, sitting here, we three,<br />
Playing our fancy, to have the snowline run<br />
So high across the pane outside. There where<br />
There is a sort of tunnel in the frost<br />
More like a tunnel than a hole&#151;way down<br />
At the far end of it you see a stir<br />
And quiver like the frayed edge of the drift<br />
Blown in the wind. I <em>like</em> that&#151;I like <em>that.</em><br />
Well, now I leave you, people.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Come, Meserve,<br />
We thought you were deciding not to go&#151;<br />
The ways you found to say the praise of comfort<br />
And being where you are. You want to stay.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;I&#146;ll own it&#146;s cold for such a fall of snow.<br />
This house is frozen brittle, all except<br />
This room you sit in. If you think the wind<br />
Sounds further off, it&#146;s not because it&#146;s dying;<br />
You&#146;re further under in the snow&#151;that&#146;s all&#151;<br />
And feel it less. Hear the soft bombs of dust<br />
It bursts against us at the chimney mouth,<br />
And at the eaves. I like it from inside<br />
More than I shall out in it. But the horses<br />
Are rested and it&#146;s time to say good-night,<br />
And let you get to bed again. Good-night,<br />
Sorry I had to break in on your sleep.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Lucky for you you did. Lucky for you<br />
You had us for a half-way station<br />
To stop at. If you were the kind of man<br />
Paid heed to women, you&#146;d take my advice<br />
And for your family&#146;s sake stay where you are.<br />
But what good is my saying it over and over?<br />
You&#146;ve done more than you had a right to think<br />
You could do&#151;<em>now.</em> You know the risk you take<br />
In going on.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Our snow-storms as a rule<br />
Aren&#146;t looked on as man-killers, and although<br />
I&#146;d rather be the beast that sleeps the sleep<br />
Under it all, his door sealed up and lost,<br />
Than the man fighting it to keep above it,<br />
Yet think of the small birds at roost and not<br />
In nests. Shall I be counted less than they are?<br />
Their bulk in water would be frozen rock<br />
In no time out to-night. And yet to-morrow<br />
They will come budding boughs from tree to tree<br />
Flirting their wings and saying Chickadee,<br />
As if not knowing what you meant by the word storm.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;But why when no one wants you to go on?<br />
Your wife&#151;she doesn&#146;t want you to. We don&#146;t,<br />
And you yourself don&#146;t want to. Who else is there?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Save us from being cornered by a woman.<br />
Well, there&#146;s&#148;&#151;She told Fred afterward that in<br />
The pause right there, she thought the dreaded word<br />
Was coming, &#147;God.&#148; But no, he only said<br />
&#147;Well, there&#146;s&#151;the storm. That says I must go on.<br />
That wants me as a war might if it came.<br />
Ask any man.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
He threw her that as something<br />
To last her till he got outside the door.<br />
He had Cole with him to the barn to see him off.<br />
When Cole returned he found his wife still standing<br />
Beside the table near the open book,<br />
Not reading it.<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Well, what kind of a man<br />
Do you call that?&#148; she said.<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;He had the gift<br />
Of words, or is it tongues, I ought to say?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Was ever such a man for seeing likeness?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Or disregarding people&#146;s civil questions&#151;<br />
What? We&#146;ve found out in one hour more about him<br />
Than we had seeing him pass by in the road<br />
A thousand times. If that&#146;s the way he preaches!<br />
You didn&#146;t think you&#146;d keep him after all.<br />
Oh, I&#146;m not blaming you. He didn&#146;t leave you<br />
Much say in the matter, and I&#146;m just as glad<br />
We&#146;re not in for a night of him. No sleep<br />
If he had stayed. The least thing set him going.<br />
It&#146;s quiet as an empty church without him.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;But how much better off are we as it is?<br />
We&#146;ll have to sit here till we know he&#146;s safe.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Yes, I suppose you&#146;ll want to, but I shouldn&#146;t.<br />
He knows what he can do, or he wouldn&#146;t try.<br />
Get into bed I say, and get some rest.<br />
He won&#146;t come back, and if he telephones,<br />
It won&#146;t be for an hour or two.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Well then.<br />
We can&#146;t be any help by sitting here<br />
And living his fight through with him, I suppose.&#148;<br />
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
<br/><br/>Cole had been telephoning in the dark.<br />
Mrs. Cole&#146;s voice came from an inner room:<br />
&#147;Did she call you or you call her?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;She me.<br />
You&#146;d better dress: you won&#146;t go back to bed.<br />
We must have been asleep: it&#146;s three and after.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Had she been ringing long? I&#146;ll get my wrapper.<br />
I want to speak to her.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;All she said was,<br />
He hadn&#146;t come and had he really started.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;She knew he had, poor thing, two hours ago.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;He had the shovel. He&#146;ll have made a fight.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Why did I ever let him leave this house!&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Don&#146;t begin that. You did the best you could<br />
To keep him&#151;though perhaps you didn&#146;t quite<br />
Conceal a wish to see him show the spunk<br />
To disobey you. Much his wife&#146;ll thank you.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Fred, after all I said! You shan&#146;t make out<br />
That it was any way but what it was.<br />
Did she let on by any word she said<br />
She didn&#146;t thank me?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;When I told her &#145;Gone,&#146;<br />
&#145;Well then,&#146; she said, and &#145;Well then&#146;&#151;like a threat.<br />
And then her voice came scraping slow: &#145;Oh, you,<br />
Why did you let him go&#146;?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Asked why we let him?<br />
You let me there. I&#146;ll ask her why she let him.<br />
She didn&#146;t dare to speak when he was here.<br />
</p>

<p>
Their number&#146;s&#151;twenty-one? The thing won&#146;t work.<br />
Someone&#146;s receiver&#146;s down. The handle stumbles.<br />
</p>

<p>
The stubborn thing, the way it jars your arm!<br />
It&#146;s theirs. She&#146;s dropped it from her hand and gone.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Try speaking. Say &#145;Hello&#146;!&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Hello. Hello.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;What do you hear?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;I hear an empty room&#151;<br />
You know&#151;it sounds that way. And yes, I hear&#151;<br />
I think I hear a clock&#151;and windows rattling.<br />
No step though. If she&#146;s there she&#146;s sitting down.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Shout, she may hear you.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Shouting is no good.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Keep speaking then.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Hello. Hello. Hello.<br />
You don&#146;t suppose&#151;? She wouldn&#146;t go out doors?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;I&#146;m half afraid that&#146;s just what she might do.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;And leave the children?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Wait and call again.<br />
You can&#146;t hear whether she has left the door<br />
Wide open and the wind&#146;s blown out the lamp<br />
And the fire&#146;s died and the room&#146;s dark and cold?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;One of two things, either she&#146;s gone to bed<br />
Or gone out doors.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;In which case both are lost.<br />
Do you know what she&#146;s like? Have you ever met her?<br />
It&#146;s strange she doesn&#146;t want to speak to us.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Fred, see if you can hear what I hear. Come.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;A clock maybe.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Don&#146;t you hear something else?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Not talking.&#148;<br />
&#147;No.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Why, yes, I hear&#151;what is it?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;What do you say it is?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;A baby&#146;s crying!<br />
Frantic it sounds, though muffled and far off.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Its mother wouldn&#146;t let it cry like that,<br />
Not if she&#146;s there.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;What do you make of it?&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;There&#146;s only one thing possible to make,<br />
That is, assuming&#151;that she has gone out.<br />
Of course she hasn&#146;t though.&#148; They both sat down<br />
Helpless. &#147;There&#146;s nothing we can do till morning.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Fred, I shan&#146;t let you think of going out.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Hold on.&#148; The double bell began to chirp.<br />
They started up. Fred took the telephone.<br />
&#147;Hello, Meserve. You&#146;re there, then!&#151;And your wife?<br />
</p>

<p>
Good! Why I asked&#151;she didn&#146;t seem to answer.<br />
He says she went to let him in the barn.&#151;<br />
We&#146;re glad. Oh, say no more about it, man.<br />
Drop in and see us when you&#146;re passing.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;Well,<br />
She has him then, though what she wants him for<br />
I <em>don&#146;t</em> see.&#148;<br />
&#147;Possibly not for herself.<br />
Maybe she only wants him for the children.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;The whole to-do seems to have been for nothing.<br />
What spoiled our night was to him just his fun.<br />
What did he come in for?&#151;To talk and visit?<br />
Thought he&#146;d just call to tell us it was snowing.<br />
If he thinks he is going to make our house<br />
A halfway coffee house &#146;twixt town and nowhere&#151;&#151;&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;I thought you&#146;d feel you&#146;d been too much concerned.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;You think you haven&#146;t been concerned yourself.&#148;<br />
</p>

<p>
&#147;If you mean he was inconsiderate<br />
To rout us out to think for him at midnight<br />
And then take our advice no more than nothing,<br />
Why, I agree with you. But let&#146;s forgive him.<br />
We&#146;ve had a share in one night of his life.<br />
What&#146;ll you bet he ever calls again?&#148;<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='trees'></a>The Sound of the Trees</h3>

<p>
I wonder about the trees.<br />
Why do we wish to bear<br />
Forever the noise of these<br />
More than another noise<br />
So close to our dwelling place?<br />
We suffer them by the day<br />
Till we lose all measure of pace,<br />
And fixity in our joys,<br />
And acquire a listening air.<br />
They are that that talks of going<br />
But never gets away;<br />
And that talks no less for knowing,<br />
As it grows wiser and older,<br />
That now it means to stay.<br />
My feet tug at the floor<br />
And my head sways to my shoulder<br />
Sometimes when I watch trees sway,<br />
From the window or the door.<br />
I shall set forth for somewhere,<br />
I shall make the reckless choice<br />
Some day when they are in voice<br />
And tossing so as to scare<br />
The white clouds over them on.<br />
I shall have less to say,<br />
But I shall be gone.<br />
</p>

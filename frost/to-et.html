<h1>To E.T.</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
I slumbered with your poems on my breast<br/>
Spread open as I dropped them half-read through<br/>
Like dove wings on a figure on a tomb<br/>
To see, if in a dream they brought of you,
</p>
<p>
I might not have the chance I missed in life<br/>
Through some delay, and call you to your face<br/>
First soldier, and then poet, and then both,<br/>
Who died a soldier-poet of your race.
</p>
<p>
I meant, you meant, that nothing should remain<br/>
Unsaid between us, brother, and this remained&mdash;<br/>
And one thing more that was not then to say:<br/>
The Victory for what it lost and gained.
</p>
<p>
You went to meet the shell's embrace of fire<br/>
On Vimy Ridge; and when you fell that day<br/>
The war seemed over more for you than me,<br/>
But now for me than you&mdash;the other way.
</p>
<p>
How over, though, for even me who knew<br/>
The foe thrust back unsafe beyond the Rhine,<br/>
If I was not to speak of it to you<br/>
And see you pleased once more with words of mine?

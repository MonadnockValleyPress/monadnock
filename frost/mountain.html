<h1>The Mountain</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
The mountain held the town as in a shadow<br />
I saw so much before I slept there once:<br />
I noticed that I missed stars in the west,<br />
Where its black body cut into the sky.<br />
Near me it seemed: I felt it like a wall<br />
Behind which I was sheltered from a wind.<br />
And yet between the town and it I found,<br />
When I walked forth at dawn to see new things,<br />
Were fields, a river, and beyond, more fields.<br />
The river at the time was fallen away,<br />
And made a widespread brawl on cobble-stones;<br />
But the signs showed what it had done in spring;<br />
Good grass-land gullied out, and in the grass<br />
Ridges of sand, and driftwood stripped of bark.<br />
I crossed the river and swung round the mountain.<br />
And there I met a man who moved so slow<br />
With white-faced oxen in a heavy cart,<br />
It seemed no hand to stop him altogether.<br />
"What town is this?" I asked.<br />
"This? Lunenburg."<br />
Then I was wrong: the town of my sojourn,<br />
Beyond the bridge, was not that of the mountain,<br />
But only felt at night its shadowy presence.<br />
"Where is your village? Very far from here?"<br />
"There is no village&mdash;only scattered farms.<br />
We were but sixty voters last election.<br />
We can't in nature grow to many more:<br />
That thing takes all the room!" He moved his goad.<br />
The mountain stood there to be pointed at.<br />
Pasture ran up the side a little way,<br />
And then there was a wall of trees with trunks:<br />
After that only tops of trees, and cliffs<br />
Imperfectly concealed among the leaves.<br />
A dry ravine emerged from under boughs<br />
Into the pasture.<br />
"That looks like a path.<br />
Is that the way to reach the top from here?&mdash;<br />
Not for this morning, but some other time:<br />
I must be getting back to breakfast now."<br />
"I don't advise your trying from this side.<br />
There is no proper path, but those that have<br />
Been up, I understand, have climbed from Ladd's.<br />
That's five miles back. You can't mistake the place:<br />
They logged it there last winter some way up.<br />
I'd take you, but I'm bound the other way."<br />
"You've never climbed it?"<br />
"I've been on the sides<br />
Deer-hunting and trout-fishing. There's a brook<br />
That starts up on it somewhere&mdash;I've heard say<br />
Right on the top, tip-top&mdash;a curious thing.<br />
But what would interest you about the brook,<br />
It's always cold in summer, warm in winter.<br />
One of the great sights going is to see<br />
It steam in winter like an ox's breath,<br />
Until the bushes all along its banks<br />
Are inch-deep with the frosty spines and bristles&mdash;<br />
You know the kind. Then let the sun shine on it!"<br />
"There ought to be a view around the world<br />
From such a mountain&mdash;if it isn't wooded<br />
Clear to the top." I saw through leafy screens<br />
Great granite terraces in sun and shadow,<br />
Shelves one could rest a knee on getting up&mdash;<br />
With depths behind him sheer a hundred feet;<br />
Or turn and sit on and look out and down,<br />
With little ferns in crevices at his elbow.<br />
"As to that I can't say. But there's the spring,<br />
Right on the summit, almost like a fountain.<br />
That ought to be worth seeing."<br />
"If it's there.<br />
You never saw it?"<br />
"I guess there's no doubt<br />
About its being there. I never saw it.<br />
It may not be right on the very top:<br />
It wouldn't have to be a long way down<br />
To have some head of water from above,<br />
And a good distance down might not be noticed<br />
By anyone who'd come a long way up.<br />
One time I asked a fellow climbing it<br />
To look and tell me later how it was."<br />
"What did he say?"
"He said there was a lake<br />
Somewhere in Ireland on a mountain top."<br />
"But a lake's different. What about the spring?"<br />
"He never got up high enough to see.<br />
That's why I don't advise your trying this side.<br />
He tried this side. I've always meant to go<br />
And look myself, but you know how it is:<br />
It doesn't seem so much to climb a mountain<br />
You've worked around the foot of all your life.<br />
What would I do? Go in my overalls,<br />
With a big stick, the same as when the cows<br />
Haven't come down to the bars at milking time?<br />
Or with a shotgun for a stray black bear?<br />
'Twouldn't seem real to climb for climbing it."<br />
"I shouldn't climb it if I didn't want to&mdash;<br />
Not for the sake of climbing. What's its name?"<br />
"We call it Hor: I don't know if that's right."<br />
"Can one walk around it? Would it be too far?"<br />
"You can drive round and keep in Lunenburg,<br />
But it's as much as ever you can do,<br />
The boundary lines keep in so close to it.<br />
Hor is the township, and the township's Hor&mdash;<br />
And a few houses sprinkled round the foot,<br />
Like boulders broken off the upper cliff,<br />
Rolled out a little farther than the rest."<br />
"Warm in December, cold in June, you say?"<br />
"I don't suppose the water's changed at all.<br />
You and I know enough to know it's warm<br />
Compared with cold, and cold compared with warm.<br />
But all the fun's in how you say a thing."<br />
"You've lived here all your life?"<br />
"Ever since Hor<br />
Was no bigger than a&mdash;&mdash;" What, I did not hear.<br />
He drew the oxen toward him with light touches<br />
Of his slim goad on nose and offside flank,<br />
Gave them their marching orders and was moving.

<h3><a id='pasture'></a>The Pasture</h3>
<p>
    I'm going out to clean the pasture spring;<br />
    I'll only stop to rake the leaves away<br />
    (And wait to watch the water clear, I may):<br />
    I sha'n't be gone long.&mdash;You come too.<br />
    I'm going out to fetch the little calf<br />
    That's standing by the mother. It's so young,<br />
    It totters when she licks it with her tongue.<br />
    I sha'n't be gone long.&mdash;You come too.
</p>

<h3><a id='mending'></a>Mending Wall</h3>
<p>
    Something there is that doesn't love a wall,<br />
    That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,<br />
    And spills the upper boulders in the sun;<br />
    And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.<br />
    The work of hunters is another thing:<br />
    I have come after them and made repair<br />
    Where they have left not one stone on a stone,<br />
    But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,<br />
    To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,<br />
    No one has seen them made or heard them made,<br />
    But at spring mending-time we find them there.<br />
    I let my neighbour know beyond the hill;<br />
    And on a day we meet to walk the line<br />
    And set the wall between us once again.<br />
    We keep the wall between us as we go.<br />
    To each the boulders that have fallen to each.<br />
    And some are loaves and some so nearly balls<br />
    We have to use a spell to make them balance:<br />
    "Stay where you are until our backs are turned!"<br />
    We wear our fingers rough with handling them.<br />
    Oh, just another kind of out-door game,<br />
    One on a side. It comes to little more:<br />
    There where it is we do not need the wall:<br />
    He is all pine and I am apple orchard.<br />
    My apple trees will never get across<br />
    And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.<br />
    He only says, "Good fences make good neighbours."<br />
    Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder<br />
    If I could put a notion in his head:<br />
    "Why do they make good neighbours? Isn't it<br />
    Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.<br />
    Before I built a wall I'd ask to know<br />
    What I was walling in or walling out,<br />
    And to whom I was like to give offence.<br />
    Something there is that doesn't love a wall,<br />
    That wants it down." I could say "Elves" to him,<br />
    But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather<br />
    He said it for himself. I see him there<br />
    Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top<br />
    In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.<br />
    He moves in darkness as it seems to me,<br />
    Not of woods only and the shade of trees.<br />
    He will not go behind his father's saying,<br />
    And he likes having thought of it so well<br />
    He says again, "Good fences make good neighbours."
</p>

<h3><a id='death'></a>The Death of the Hired Man</h3>
<p>
    Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table<br />
    Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step,<br />
    She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage<br />
    To meet him in the doorway with the news<br />
    And put him on his guard. "Silas is back."<br />
    She pushed him outward with her through the door<br />
    And shut it after her. "Be kind," she said.<br />
    She took the market things from Warren's arms<br />
    And set them on the porch, then drew him down<br />
    To sit beside her on the wooden steps.<br />
    "When was I ever anything but kind to him?<br />
    But I'll not have the fellow back," he said.<br />
    "I told him so last haying, didn't I?<br />
    'If he left then,' I said, 'that ended it.'<br />
    What good is he? Who else will harbour him<br />
    At his age for the little he can do?<br />
    What help he is there's no depending on.<br />
    Off he goes always when I need him most.<br />
    'He thinks he ought to earn a little pay,<br />
    Enough at least to buy tobacco with,<br />
    So he won't have to beg and be beholden.'<br />
    'All right,' I say, 'I can't afford to pay<br />
    Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.'<br />
    'Someone else can.' 'Then someone else will have to.'<br />
    I shouldn't mind his bettering himself<br />
    If that was what it was. You can be certain,<br />
    When he begins like that, there's someone at him<br />
    Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,&mdash;<br />
    In haying time, when any help is scarce.<br />
    In winter he comes back to us. I'm done."<br />
    "Sh! not so loud: he'll hear you," Mary said.<br />
    "I want him to: he'll have to soon or late."<br />
    "He's worn out. He's asleep beside the stove.<br />
    When I came up from Rowe's I found him here,<br />
    Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep,<br />
    A miserable sight, and frightening, too&mdash;<br />
    You needn't smile&mdash;I didn't recognise him&mdash;<br />
    I wasn't looking for him&mdash;and he's changed.<br />
    Wait till you see."<br />
    "Where did you say he'd been?"<br />
    "He didn't say. I dragged him to the house,<br />
    And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke.<br />
    I tried to make him talk about his travels.<br />
    Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off."<br />
    "What did he say? Did he say anything?"<br />
    "But little."<br />
    "Anything? Mary, confess<br />
    He said he'd come to ditch the meadow for me."<br />
    "Warren!"<br />
    "But did he? I just want to know."<br />
    "Of course he did. What would you have him say?<br />
    Surely you wouldn't grudge the poor old man<br />
    Some humble way to save his self-respect.<br />
    He added, if you really care to know,<br />
    He meant to clear the upper pasture, too.<br />
    That sounds like something you have heard before?<br />
    Warren, I wish you could have heard the way<br />
    He jumbled everything. I stopped to look<br />
    Two or three times&mdash;he made me feel so queer&mdash;<br />
    To see if he was talking in his sleep.<br />
    He ran on Harold Wilson&mdash;you remember&mdash;<br />
    The boy you had in haying four years since.<br />
    He's finished school, and teaching in his college.<br />
    Silas declares you'll have to get him back.<br />
    He says they two will make a team for work:<br />
    Between them they will lay this farm as smooth!<br />
    The way he mixed that in with other things.<br />
    He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft<br />
    On education&mdash;you know how they fought<br />
    All through July under the blazing sun,<br />
    Silas up on the cart to build the load,<br />
    Harold along beside to pitch it on."<br />
    "Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot."<br />
    "Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream.<br />
    You wouldn't think they would. How some things linger!<br />
    Harold's young college boy's assurance piqued him.<br />
    After so many years he still keeps finding<br />
    Good arguments he sees he might have used.<br />
    I sympathise. I know just how it feels<br />
    To think of the right thing to say too late.<br />
    Harold's associated in his mind with Latin.<br />
    He asked me what I thought of Harold's saying<br />
    He studied Latin like the violin<br />
    Because he liked it&mdash;that an argument!<br />
    He said he couldn't make the boy believe<br />
    He could find water with a hazel prong&mdash;<br />
    Which showed how much good school had ever done him.<br />
    He wanted to go over that. But most of all<br />
    He thinks if he could have another chance<br />
    To teach him how to build a load of hay&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    "I know, that's Silas' one accomplishment.<br />
    He bundles every forkful in its place,<br />
    And tags and numbers it for future reference,<br />
    So he can find and easily dislodge it<br />
    In the unloading. Silas does that well.<br />
    He takes it out in bunches like big birds' nests.<br />
    You never see him standing on the hay<br />
    He's trying to lift, straining to lift himself."<br />
    "He thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be<br />
    Some good perhaps to someone in the world.<br />
    He hates to see a boy the fool of books.<br />
    Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk,<br />
    And nothing to look backward to with pride,<br />
    And nothing to look forward to with hope,<br />
    So now and never any different."<br />
    Part of a moon was falling down the west,<br />
    Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills.<br />
    Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw<br />
    And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand<br />
    Among the harp-like morning-glory strings,<br />
    Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,<br />
    As if she played unheard the tenderness<br />
    That wrought on him beside her in the night.<br />
    "Warren," she said, "he has come home to die:<br />
    You needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time."<br />
    "Home," he mocked gently.<br />
    "Yes, what else but home?<br />
    It all depends on what you mean by home.<br />
    Of course he's nothing to us, any more<br />
    Than was the hound that came a stranger to us<br />
    Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail."<br />
    "Home is the place where, when you have to go there,<br />
    They have to take you in."<br />
    "I should have called it<br />
    Something you somehow haven't to deserve."<br />
    Warren leaned out and took a step or two,<br />
    Picked up a little stick, and brought it back<br />
    And broke it in his hand and tossed it by.<br />
    "Silas has better claim on us you think<br />
    Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles<br />
    As the road winds would bring him to his door.<br />
    Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day.<br />
    Why didn't he go there? His brother's rich,<br />
    A somebody&mdash;director in the bank."<br />
    "He never told us that."<br />
    "We know it though."<br />
    "I think his brother ought to help, of course.<br />
    I'll see to that if there is need. He ought of right<br />
    To take him in, and might be willing to&mdash;<br />
    He may be better than appearances.<br />
    But have some pity on Silas. Do you think<br />
    If he'd had any pride in claiming kin<br />
    Or anything he looked for from his brother,<br />
    He'd keep so still about him all this time?"<br />
    "I wonder what's between them."<br />
    "I can tell you.<br />
    Silas is what he is&mdash;we wouldn't mind him&mdash;<br />
    But just the kind that kinsfolk can't abide.<br />
    He never did a thing so very bad.<br />
    He don't know why he isn't quite as good<br />
    As anyone. He won't be made ashamed<br />
    To please his brother, worthless though he is."<br />
    "I can't think Si ever hurt anyone."<br />
    "No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay<br />
    And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back.<br />
    He wouldn't let me put him on the lounge.<br />
    You must go in and see what you can do.<br />
    I made the bed up for him there to-night.<br />
    You'll be surprised at him&mdash;how much he's broken.<br />
    His working days are done; I'm sure of it."<br />
    "I'd not be in a hurry to say that."<br />
    "I haven't been. Go, look, see for yourself.<br />
    But, Warren, please remember how it is:<br />
    He's come to help you ditch the meadow.<br />
    He has a plan. You mustn't laugh at him.<br />
    He may not speak of it, and then he may.<br />
    I'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud<br />
    Will hit or miss the moon."<br />
    It hit the moon.<br />
    Then there were three there, making a dim row,<br />
    The moon, the little silver cloud, and she.<br />
    Warren returned&mdash;too soon, it seemed to her,<br />
    Slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited.<br />
    "Warren," she questioned.<br />
    "Dead," was all he answered.

<h3><a id='mountain'></a>The Mountain</h3>
<p>
    The mountain held the town as in a shadow<br />
    I saw so much before I slept there once:<br />
    I noticed that I missed stars in the west,<br />
    Where its black body cut into the sky.<br />
    Near me it seemed: I felt it like a wall<br />
    Behind which I was sheltered from a wind.<br />
    And yet between the town and it I found,<br />
    When I walked forth at dawn to see new things,<br />
    Were fields, a river, and beyond, more fields.<br />
    The river at the time was fallen away,<br />
    And made a widespread brawl on cobble-stones;<br />
    But the signs showed what it had done in spring;<br />
    Good grass-land gullied out, and in the grass<br />
    Ridges of sand, and driftwood stripped of bark.<br />
    I crossed the river and swung round the mountain.<br />
    And there I met a man who moved so slow<br />
    With white-faced oxen in a heavy cart,<br />
    It seemed no hand to stop him altogether.<br />
    "What town is this?" I asked.<br />
    "This? Lunenburg."<br />
    Then I was wrong: the town of my sojourn,<br />
    Beyond the bridge, was not that of the mountain,<br />
    But only felt at night its shadowy presence.<br />
    "Where is your village? Very far from here?"<br />
    "There is no village&mdash;only scattered farms.<br />
    We were but sixty voters last election.<br />
    We can't in nature grow to many more:<br />
    That thing takes all the room!" He moved his goad.<br />
    The mountain stood there to be pointed at.<br />
    Pasture ran up the side a little way,<br />
    And then there was a wall of trees with trunks:<br />
    After that only tops of trees, and cliffs<br />
    Imperfectly concealed among the leaves.<br />
    A dry ravine emerged from under boughs<br />
    Into the pasture.<br />
    "That looks like a path.<br />
    Is that the way to reach the top from here?&mdash;<br />
    Not for this morning, but some other time:<br />
    I must be getting back to breakfast now."<br />
    "I don't advise your trying from this side.<br />
    There is no proper path, but those that have<br />
    Been up, I understand, have climbed from Ladd's.<br />
    That's five miles back. You can't mistake the place:<br />
    They logged it there last winter some way up.<br />
    I'd take you, but I'm bound the other way."<br />
    "You've never climbed it?"<br />
    "I've been on the sides<br />
    Deer-hunting and trout-fishing. There's a brook<br />
    That starts up on it somewhere&mdash;I've heard say<br />
    Right on the top, tip-top&mdash;a curious thing.<br />
    But what would interest you about the brook,<br />
    It's always cold in summer, warm in winter.<br />
    One of the great sights going is to see<br />
    It steam in winter like an ox's breath,<br />
    Until the bushes all along its banks<br />
    Are inch-deep with the frosty spines and bristles&mdash;<br />
    You know the kind. Then let the sun shine on it!"<br />
    "There ought to be a view around the world<br />
    From such a mountain&mdash;if it isn't wooded<br />
    Clear to the top." I saw through leafy screens<br />
    Great granite terraces in sun and shadow,<br />
    Shelves one could rest a knee on getting up&mdash;<br />
    With depths behind him sheer a hundred feet;<br />
    Or turn and sit on and look out and down,<br />
    With little ferns in crevices at his elbow.<br />
    "As to that I can't say. But there's the spring,<br />
    Right on the summit, almost like a fountain.<br />
    That ought to be worth seeing."<br />
    "If it's there.<br />
    You never saw it?"<br />
    "I guess there's no doubt<br />
    About its being there. I never saw it.<br />
    It may not be right on the very top:<br />
    It wouldn't have to be a long way down<br />
    To have some head of water from above,<br />
    And a good distance down might not be noticed<br />
    By anyone who'd come a long way up.<br />
    One time I asked a fellow climbing it<br />
    To look and tell me later how it was."<br />
    "What did he say?"
    "He said there was a lake<br />
    Somewhere in Ireland on a mountain top."<br />
    "But a lake's different. What about the spring?"<br />
    "He never got up high enough to see.<br />
    That's why I don't advise your trying this side.<br />
    He tried this side. I've always meant to go<br />
    And look myself, but you know how it is:<br />
    It doesn't seem so much to climb a mountain<br />
    You've worked around the foot of all your life.<br />
    What would I do? Go in my overalls,<br />
    With a big stick, the same as when the cows<br />
    Haven't come down to the bars at milking time?<br />
    Or with a shotgun for a stray black bear?<br />
    'Twouldn't seem real to climb for climbing it."<br />
    "I shouldn't climb it if I didn't want to&mdash;<br />
    Not for the sake of climbing. What's its name?"<br />
    "We call it Hor: I don't know if that's right."<br />
    "Can one walk around it? Would it be too far?"<br />
    "You can drive round and keep in Lunenburg,<br />
    But it's as much as ever you can do,<br />
    The boundary lines keep in so close to it.<br />
    Hor is the township, and the township's Hor&mdash;<br />
    And a few houses sprinkled round the foot,<br />
    Like boulders broken off the upper cliff,<br />
    Rolled out a little farther than the rest."<br />
    "Warm in December, cold in June, you say?"<br />
    "I don't suppose the water's changed at all.<br />
    You and I know enough to know it's warm<br />
    Compared with cold, and cold compared with warm.<br />
    But all the fun's in how you say a thing."<br />
    "You've lived here all your life?"<br />
    "Ever since Hor<br />
    Was no bigger than a&mdash;&mdash;" What, I did not hear.<br />
    He drew the oxen toward him with light touches<br />
    Of his slim goad on nose and offside flank,<br />
    Gave them their marching orders and was moving.
</p>

<h3><a id='collars'></a>A Hundred Collars</h3>
<p>
    Lancaster bore him&mdash;such a little town,<br />
    Such a great man. It doesn't see him often<br />
    Of late years, though he keeps the old homestead<br />
    And sends the children down there with their mother<br />
    To run wild in the summer&mdash;a little wild.<br />
    Sometimes he joins them for a day or two<br />
    And sees old friends he somehow can't get near.<br />
    They meet him in the general store at night,<br />
    Pre-occupied with formidable mail,<br />
    Rifling a printed letter as he talks.<br />
    They seem afraid. He wouldn't have it so:<br />
    Though a great scholar, he's a democrat,<br />
    If not at heart, at least on principle.<br />
    Lately when coming up to Lancaster<br />
    His train being late he missed another train<br />
    And had four hours to wait at Woodsville Junction<br />
    After eleven o'clock at night. Too tired<br />
    To think of sitting such an ordeal out,<br />
    He turned to the hotel to find a bed.<br />
    "No room," the night clerk said. "Unless&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    Woodsville's a place of shrieks and wandering lamps<br />
    And cars that shook and rattle&mdash;and one hotel.<br />
    "You say 'unless.'"<br />
    "Unless you wouldn't mind<br />
    Sharing a room with someone else."<br />
    "Who is it?"<br />
    "A man."<br />
    "So I should hope. What kind of man?"<br />
    "I know him: he's all right. A man's a man.<br />
    Separate beds of course you understand."<br />
    The night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on.<br />
    "Who's that man sleeping in the office chair?<br />
    Has he had the refusal of my chance?"<br />
    "He was afraid of being robbed or murdered.<br />
    What do you say?"<br />
    "I'll have to have a bed."<br />
    The night clerk led him up three flights of stairs<br />
    And down a narrow passage full of doors,<br />
    At the last one of which he knocked and entered.<br />
    "Lafe, here's a fellow wants to share your room."<br />
    "Show him this way. I'm not afraid of him.<br />
    I'm not so drunk I can't take care of myself."<br />
    The night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot.<br />
    "This will be yours. Good-night," he said, and went.<br />
    "Lafe was the name, I think?"<br />
    "Yes, Layfayette.<br />
    You got it the first time. And yours?"<br />
    "Magoon.<br />
    Doctor Magoon."<br />
    "A Doctor?"<br />
    "Well, a teacher."<br />
    "Professor Square-the-circle-till-you're-tired?<br />
    Hold on, there's something I don't think of now<br />
    That I had on my mind to ask the first<br />
    Man that knew anything I happened in with.<br />
    I'll ask you later&mdash;don't let me forget it."<br />
    The Doctor looked at Lafe and looked away.<br />
    A man? A brute. Naked above the waist,<br />
    He sat there creased and shining in the light,<br />
    Fumbling the buttons in a well-starched shirt.<br />
    "I'm moving into a size-larger shirt.<br />
    I've felt mean lately; mean's no name for it.<br />
    I just found what the matter was to-night:<br />
    I've been a-choking like a nursery tree<br />
    When it outgrows the wire band of its name tag.<br />
    I blamed it on the hot spell we've been having.<br />
    'Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back,<br />
    Not liking to own up I'd grown a size.<br />
    Number eighteen this is. What size do you wear?"<br />
    The Doctor caught his throat convulsively.<br />
    "Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;fourteen&mdash;fourteen."<br />
    "Fourteen! You say so!<br />
    I can remember when I wore fourteen.<br />
    And come to think I must have back at home<br />
    More than a hundred collars, size fourteen.<br />
    Too bad to waste them all. You ought to have them.<br />
    They're yours and welcome; let me send them to you.<br />
    What makes you stand there on one leg like that?<br />
    You're not much furtherer than where Kike left you.<br />
    You act as if you wished you hadn't come.<br />
    Sit down or lie down, friend; you make me nervous."<br />
    The Doctor made a subdued dash for it,<br />
    And propped himself at bay against a pillow.<br />
    "Not that way, with your shoes on Kike's white bed.<br />
    You can't rest that way. Let me pull your shoes off."<br />
    "Don't touch me, please&mdash;I say, don't touch me, please.<br />
    I'll not be put to bed by you, my man."<br />
    "Just as you say. Have it your own way then.<br />
    'My man' is it? You talk like a professor.<br />
    Speaking of who's afraid of who, however,<br />
    I'm thinking I have more to lose than you<br />
    If anything should happen to be wrong.<br />
    Who wants to cut your number fourteen throat!<br />
    Let's have a show down as an evidence<br />
    Of good faith. There is ninety dollars.<br />
    Come, if you're not afraid."<br />
    "I'm not afraid.<br />
    There's five: that's all I carry."<br />
    "I can search you?<br />
    Where are you moving over to? Stay still.<br />
    You'd better tuck your money under you<br />
    And sleep on it the way I always do<br />
    When I'm with people I don't trust at night."<br />
    "Will you believe me if I put it there<br />
    Right on the counterpane&mdash;that I do trust you?"<br />
    "You'd say so, Mister Man.&mdash;I'm a collector.<br />
    My ninety isn't mine&mdash;you won't think that.<br />
    I pick it up a dollar at a time<br />
    All round the country for the Weekly News,<br />
    Published in Bow. You know the Weekly News?"<br />
    "Known it since I was young."<br />
    "Then you know me.<br />
    Now we are getting on together&mdash;talking.<br />
    I'm sort of Something for it at the front.<br />
    My business is to find what people want:<br />
    They pay for it, and so they ought to have it.<br />
    Fairbanks, he says to me&mdash;he's editor&mdash;<br />
    Feel out the public sentiment&mdash;he says.<br />
    A good deal comes on me when all is said.<br />
    The only trouble is we disagree<br />
    In politics: I'm Vermont Democrat&mdash;<br />
    You know what that is, sort of double-dyed;<br />
    The News has always been Republican.<br />
    Fairbanks, he says to me, 'Help us this year,'<br />
    Meaning by us their ticket. 'No,' I says,<br />
    'I can't and won't. You've been in long enough:<br />
    It's time you turned around and boosted us.<br />
    You'll have to pay me more than ten a week<br />
    If I'm expected to elect Bill Taft.<br />
    I doubt if I could do it anyway.'"<br />
    "You seem to shape the paper's policy."<br />
    "You see I'm in with everybody, know 'em all.<br />
    I almost know their farms as well as they do."<br />
    "You drive around? It must be pleasant work."<br />
    "It's business, but I can't say it's not fun.<br />
    What I like best's the lay of different farms,<br />
    Coming out on them from a stretch of woods,<br />
    Or over a hill or round a sudden corner.<br />
    I like to find folks getting out in spring,<br />
    Raking the dooryard, working near the house.<br />
    Later they get out further in the fields.<br />
    Everything's shut sometimes except the barn;<br />
    The family's all away in some back meadow.<br />
    There's a hay load a-coming&mdash;when it comes.<br />
    And later still they all get driven in:<br />
    The fields are stripped to lawn, the garden patches<br />
    Stripped to bare ground, the apple trees<br />
    To whips and poles. There's nobody about.<br />
    The chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk smoking.<br />
    And I lie back and ride. I take the reins<br />
    Only when someone's coming, and the mare<br />
    Stops when she likes: I tell her when to go.<br />
    I've spoiled Jemima in more ways than one.<br />
    She's got so she turns in at every house<br />
    As if she had some sort of curvature,<br />
    No matter if I have no errand there.<br />
    She thinks I'm sociable. I maybe am.<br />
    It's seldom I get down except for meals, though.<br />
    Folks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep,<br />
    All in a family row down to the youngest."<br />
    "One would suppose they might not be as glad<br />
    To see you as you are to see them."<br />
    "Oh,<br />
    Because I want their dollar. I don't want<br />
    Anything they've not got. I never dun.<br />
    I'm there, and they can pay me if they like.<br />
    I go nowhere on purpose: I happen by.<br />
    Sorry there is no cup to give you a drink.<br />
    I drink out of the bottle&mdash;not your style.<br />
    Mayn't I offer you&mdash;&mdash;?"<br />
    "No, no, no, thank you."<br />
    "Just as you say. Here's looking at you then.&mdash;<br />
    And now I'm leaving you a little while.<br />
    You'll rest easier when I'm gone, perhaps&mdash;<br />
    Lie down&mdash;let yourself go and get some sleep.<br />
    But first&mdash;let's see&mdash;what was I going to ask you?<br />
    Those collars&mdash;who shall I address them to,<br />
    Suppose you aren't awake when I come back?"<br />
    "Really, friend, I can't let you. You&mdash;may need them."<br />
    "Not till I shrink, when they'll be out of style."<br />
    "But really I&mdash;I have so many collars."<br />
    "I don't know who I rather would have have them.<br />
    They're only turning yellow where they are.<br />
    But you're the doctor as the saying is.<br />
    I'll put the light out. Don't you wait for me:<br />
    I've just begun the night. You get some sleep.<br />
    I'll knock so-fashion and peep round the door<br />
    When I come back so you'll know who it is.<br />
    There's nothing I'm afraid of like scared people.<br />
    I don't want you should shoot me in the head.<br />
    What am I doing carrying off this bottle?<br />
    There now, you get some sleep."<br />
    He shut the door.<br />
    The Doctor slid a little down the pillow.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id='burial'></a>Home Burial</h3>
<p>
    He saw her from the bottom of the stairs<br />
    Before she saw him. She was starting down,<br />
    Looking back over her shoulder at some fear.<br />
    She took a doubtful step and then undid it<br />
    To raise herself and look again. He spoke<br />
    Advancing toward her: "What is it you see<br />
    From up there always&mdash;for I want to know."<br />
    She turned and sank upon her skirts at that,<br />
    And her face changed from terrified to dull.<br />
    He said to gain time: "What is it you see,"<br />
    Mounting until she cowered under him.<br />
    "I will find out now&mdash;you must tell me, dear."<br />
    She, in her place, refused him any help<br />
    With the least stiffening of her neck and silence.<br />
    She let him look, sure that he wouldn't see,<br />
    Blind creature; and a while he didn't see.<br />
    But at last he murmured, "Oh," and again, "Oh."<br />
    "What is it&mdash;what?" she said.<br />
    "Just that I see."<br />
    "You don't," she challenged. "Tell me what it is."<br />
    "The wonder is I didn't see at once.<br />
    I never noticed it from here before.<br />
    I must be wonted to it&mdash;that's the reason.<br />
    The little graveyard where my people are!<br />
    So small the window frames the whole of it.<br />
    Not so much larger than a bedroom, is it?<br />
    There are three stones of slate and one of marble,<br />
    Broad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight<br />
    On the sidehill. We haven't to mind those.<br />
    But I understand: it is not the stones,<br />
    But the child's mound&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    "Don't, don't, don't, don't," she cried.<br />
    She withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm<br />
    That rested on the banister, and slid downstairs;<br />
    And turned on him with such a daunting look,<br />
    He said twice over before he knew himself:<br />
    "Can't a man speak of his own child he's lost?"<br />
    "Not you! Oh, where's my hat? Oh, I don't need it!<br />
    I must get out of here. I must get air.<br />
    I don't know rightly whether any man can."<br />
    "Amy! Don't go to someone else this time.<br />
    Listen to me. I won't come down the stairs."<br />
    He sat and fixed his chin between his fists.<br />
    "There's something I should like to ask you, dear."<br />
    "You don't know how to ask it."<br />
    "Help me, then."<br />
    Her fingers moved the latch for all reply.<br />
    "My words are nearly always an offence.<br />
    I don't know how to speak of anything<br />
    So as to please you. But I might be taught<br />
    I should suppose. I can't say I see how.<br />
    A man must partly give up being a man<br />
    With women-folk. We could have some arrangement<br />
    By which I'd bind myself to keep hands off<br />
    Anything special you're a-mind to name.<br />
    Though I don't like such things 'twixt those that love.<br />
    Two that don't love can't live together without them.<br />
    But two that do can't live together with them."<br />
    She moved the latch a little. "Don't&mdash;don't go.<br />
    Don't carry it to someone else this time.<br />
    Tell me about it if it's something human.<br />
    Let me into your grief. I'm not so much<br />
    Unlike other folks as your standing there<br />
    Apart would make me out. Give me my chance.<br />
    I do think, though, you overdo it a little.<br />
    What was it brought you up to think it the thing<br />
    To take your mother-loss of a first child<br />
    So inconsolably&mdash;in the face of love.<br />
    You'd think his memory might be satisfied&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    "There you go sneering now!"<br />
    "I'm not, I'm not!<br />
    You make me angry. I'll come down to you.<br />
    God, what a woman! And it's come to this,<br />
    A man can't speak of his own child that's dead."<br />
    "You can't because you don't know how.<br />
    If you had any feelings, you that dug<br />
    With your own hand&mdash;how could you?&mdash;his little grave;<br />
    I saw you from that very window there,<br />
    Making the gravel leap and leap in air,<br />
    Leap up, like that, like that, and land so lightly<br />
    And roll back down the mound beside the hole.<br />
    I thought, Who is that man? I didn't know you.<br />
    And I crept down the stairs and up the stairs<br />
    To look again, and still your spade kept lifting.<br />
    Then you came in. I heard your rumbling voice<br />
    Out in the kitchen, and I don't know why,<br />
    But I went near to see with my own eyes.<br />
    You could sit there with the stains on your shoes<br />
    Of the fresh earth from your own baby's grave<br />
    And talk about your everyday concerns.<br />
    You had stood the spade up against the wall<br />
    Outside there in the entry, for I saw it."<br />
    "I shall laugh the worst laugh I ever laughed.<br />
    I'm cursed. God, if I don't believe I'm cursed."<br />
    "I can repeat the very words you were saying.<br />
    'Three foggy mornings and one rainy day<br />
    Will rot the best birch fence a man can build.'<br />
    Think of it, talk like that at such a time!<br />
    What had how long it takes a birch to rot<br />
    To do with what was in the darkened parlour.<br />
    You couldn't care! The nearest friends can go<br />
    With anyone to death, comes so far short<br />
    They might as well not try to go at all.<br />
    No, from the time when one is sick to death,<br />
    One is alone, and he dies more alone.<br />
    Friends make pretence of following to the grave,<br />
    But before one is in it, their minds are turned<br />
    And making the best of their way back to life<br />
    And living people, and things they understand.<br />
    But the world's evil. I won't have grief so<br />
    If I can change it. Oh, I won't, I won't!"<br />
    "There, you have said it all and you feel better.<br />
    You won't go now. You're crying. Close the door.<br />
    The heart's gone out of it: why keep it up.<br />
    Amy! There's someone coming down the road!"<br />
    "You&mdash;oh, you think the talk is all. I must go&mdash;<br />
    Somewhere out of this house. How can I make you&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    "If&mdash;you&mdash;do!" She was opening the door wider.<br />
    "Where do you mean to go? First tell me that.<br />
    I'll follow and bring you back by force. I will!&mdash;"
</p>

<h3><a id='cottage'></a>The Black Cottage</h3>
<p>
    We chanced in passing by that afternoon<br />
    To catch it in a sort of special picture<br />
    Among tar-banded ancient cherry trees,<br />
    Set well back from the road in rank lodged grass,<br />
    The little cottage we were speaking of,<br />
    A front with just a door between two windows,<br />
    Fresh painted by the shower a velvet black.<br />
    We paused, the minister and I, to look.<br />
    He made as if to hold it at arm's length<br />
    Or put the leaves aside that framed it in.<br />
    "Pretty," he said. "Come in. No one will care."<br />
    The path was a vague parting in the grass<br />
    That led us to a weathered window-sill.<br />
    We pressed our faces to the pane. "You see," he said,<br />
    "Everything's as she left it when she died.<br />
    Her sons won't sell the house or the things in it.<br />
    They say they mean to come and summer here<br />
    Where they were boys. They haven't come this year.<br />
    They live so far away&mdash;one is out west&mdash;<br />
    It will be hard for them to keep their word.<br />
    Anyway they won't have the place disturbed."<br />
    A buttoned hair-cloth lounge spread scrolling arms<br />
    Under a crayon portrait on the wall<br />
    Done sadly from an old daguerreotype.<br />
    "That was the father as he went to war.<br />
    She always, when she talked about war,<br />
    Sooner or later came and leaned, half knelt<br />
    Against the lounge beside it, though I doubt<br />
    If such unlifelike lines kept power to stir<br />
    Anything in her after all the years.<br />
    He fell at Gettysburg or Fredericksburg,<br />
    I ought to know&mdash;it makes a difference which:<br />
    Fredericksburg wasn't Gettysburg, of course.<br />
    But what I'm getting to is how forsaken<br />
    A little cottage this has always seemed;<br />
    Since she went more than ever, but before&mdash;<br />
    I don't mean altogether by the lives<br />
    That had gone out of it, the father first,<br />
    Then the two sons, till she was left alone.<br />
    (Nothing could draw her after those two sons.<br />
    She valued the considerate neglect<br />
    She had at some cost taught them after years.)<br />
    I mean by the world's having passed it by&mdash;<br />
    As we almost got by this afternoon.<br />
    It always seems to me a sort of mark<br />
    To measure how far fifty years have brought us.<br />
    Why not sit down if you are in no haste?<br />
    These doorsteps seldom have a visitor.<br />
    The warping boards pull out their own old nails<br />
    With none to tread and put them in their place.<br />
    She had her own idea of things, the old lady.<br />
    And she liked talk. She had seen Garrison<br />
    And Whittier, and had her story of them.<br />
    One wasn't long in learning that she thought<br />
    Whatever else the Civil War was for<br />
    It wasn't just to keep the States together,<br />
    Nor just to free the slaves, though it did both.<br />
    She wouldn't have believed those ends enough<br />
    To have given outright for them all she gave.<br />
    Her giving somehow touched the principle<br />
    That all men are created free and equal.<br />
    And to hear her quaint phrases&mdash;so removed<br />
    From the world's view to-day of all those things.<br />
    That's a hard mystery of Jefferson's.<br />
    What did he mean? Of course the easy way<br />
    Is to decide it simply isn't true.<br />
    It may not be. I heard a fellow say so.<br />
    But never mind, the Welshman got it planted<br />
    Where it will trouble us a thousand years.<br />
    Each age will have to reconsider it.<br />
    You couldn't tell her what the West was saying,<br />
    And what the South to her serene belief.<br />
    She had some art of hearing and yet not<br />
    Hearing the latter wisdom of the world.<br />
    White was the only race she ever knew.<br />
    Black she had scarcely seen, and yellow never.<br />
    But how could they be made so very unlike<br />
    By the same hand working in the same stuff?<br />
    She had supposed the war decided that.<br />
    What are you going to do with such a person?<br />
    Strange how such innocence gets its own way.<br />
    I shouldn't be surprised if in this world<br />
    It were the force that would at last prevail.<br />
    Do you know but for her there was a time<br />
    When to please younger members of the church,<br />
    Or rather say non-members in the church,<br />
    Whom we all have to think of nowadays,<br />
    I would have changed the Creed a very little?<br />
    Not that she ever had to ask me not to;<br />
    It never got so far as that; but the bare thought<br />
    Of her old tremulous bonnet in the pew,<br />
    And of her half asleep was too much for me.<br />
    Why, I might wake her up and startle her.<br />
    It was the words 'descended into Hades'<br />
    That seemed too pagan to our liberal youth.<br />
    You know they suffered from a general onslaught.<br />
    And well, if they weren't true why keep right on<br />
    Saying them like the heathen? We could drop them.<br />
    Only&mdash;there was the bonnet in the pew.<br />
    Such a phrase couldn't have meant much to her.<br />
    But suppose she had missed it from the Creed<br />
    As a child misses the unsaid Good-night,<br />
    And falls asleep with heartache&mdash;how should I feel?<br />
    I'm just as glad she made me keep hands off,<br />
    For, dear me, why abandon a belief<br />
    Merely because it ceases to be true.<br />
    Cling to it long enough, and not a doubt<br />
    It will turn true again, for so it goes.<br />
    Most of the change we think we see in life<br />
    Is due to truths being in and out of favour.<br />
    As I sit here, and oftentimes, I wish<br />
    I could be monarch of a desert land<br />
    I could devote and dedicate forever<br />
    To the truths we keep coming back and back to.<br />
    So desert it would have to be, so walled<br />
    By mountain ranges half in summer snow,<br />
    No one would covet it or think it worth<br />
    The pains of conquering to force change on.<br />
    Scattered oases where men dwelt, but mostly<br />
    Sand dunes held loosely in tamarisk<br />
    Blown over and over themselves in idleness.<br />
    Sand grains should sugar in the natal dew<br />
    The babe born to the desert, the sand storm<br />
    Retard mid-waste my cowering caravans&mdash;<br />
    "There are bees in this wall." He struck the clapboards,<br />
    Fierce heads looked out; small bodies pivoted.<br />
    We rose to go. Sunset blazed on the windows.
</p>

<h3><a id='blueberries'></a>Blueberries</h3>
<p>
    "You ought to have seen what I saw on my way<br />
    To the village, through Mortenson's pasture to-day:<br />
    Blueberries as big as the end of your thumb,<br />
    Real sky-blue, and heavy, and ready to drum<br />
    In the cavernous pail of the first one to come!<br />
    And all ripe together, not some of them green<br />
    And some of them ripe! You ought to have seen!"<br />
    "I don't know what part of the pasture you mean."<br />
    "You know where they cut off the woods&mdash;let me see&mdash;<br />
    It was two years ago&mdash;or no!&mdash;can it be<br />
    No longer than that?&mdash;and the following fall<br />
    The fire ran and burned it all up but the wall."<br />
    "Why, there hasn't been time for the bushes to grow.<br />
    That's always the way with the blueberries, though:<br />
    There may not have been the ghost of a sign<br />
    Of them anywhere under the shade of the pine,<br />
    But get the pine out of the way, you may burn<br />
    The pasture all over until not a fern<br />
    Or grass-blade is left, not to mention a stick,<br />
    And presto, they're up all around you as thick<br />
    And hard to explain as a conjuror's trick."<br />
    "It must be on charcoal they fatten their fruit.<br />
    I taste in them sometimes the flavour of soot.<br />
    And after all really they're ebony skinned:<br />
    The blue's but a mist from the breath of the wind,<br />
    A tarnish that goes at a touch of the hand,<br />
    And less than the tan with which pickers are tanned."<br />
    "Does Mortenson know what he has, do you think?"<br />
    "He may and not care and so leave the chewink<br />
    To gather them for him&mdash;you know what he is.<br />
    He won't make the fact that they're rightfully his<br />
    An excuse for keeping us other folk out."<br />
    "I wonder you didn't see Loren about."<br />
    "The best of it was that I did. Do you know,<br />
    I was just getting through what the field had to show<br />
    And over the wall and into the road,<br />
    When who should come by, with a democrat-load<br />
    Of all the young chattering Lorens alive,<br />
    But Loren, the fatherly, out for a drive."<br />
    "He saw you, then? What did he do? Did he frown?"<br />
    "He just kept nodding his head up and down.<br />
    You know how politely he always goes by.<br />
    But he thought a big thought&mdash;I could tell by his eye&mdash;<br />
    Which being expressed, might be this in effect:<br />
    'I have left those there berries, I shrewdly suspect,<br />
    To ripen too long. I am greatly to blame.'"<br />
    "He's a thriftier person than some I could name."<br />
    "He seems to be thrifty; and hasn't he need,<br />
    With the mouths of all those young Lorens to feed?<br />
    He has brought them all up on wild berries, they say,<br />
    Like birds. They store a great many away.<br />
    They eat them the year round, and those they don't eat<br />
    They sell in the store and buy shoes for their feet."<br />
    "Who cares what they say? It's a nice way to live,<br />
    Just taking what Nature is willing to give,<br />
    Not forcing her hand with harrow and plow."<br />
    "I wish you had seen his perpetual bow&mdash;<br />
    And the air of the youngsters! Not one of them turned,<br />
    And they looked so solemn-absurdly concerned."<br />
    "I wish I knew half what the flock of them know<br />
    Of where all the berries and other things grow,<br />
    Cranberries in bogs and raspberries on top<br />
    Of the boulder-strewn mountain, and when they will crop.<br />
    I met them one day and each had a flower<br />
    Stuck into his berries as fresh as a shower;<br />
    Some strange kind&mdash;they told me it hadn't a name."<br />
    "I've told you how once not long after we came,<br />
    I almost provoked poor Loren to mirth<br />
    By going to him of all people on earth<br />
    To ask if he knew any fruit to be had<br />
    For the picking. The rascal, he said he'd be glad<br />
    To tell if he knew. But the year had been bad.<br />
    There had been some berries&mdash;but those were all gone.<br />
    He didn't say where they had been. He went on:<br />
    'I'm sure&mdash;I'm sure'&mdash;as polite as could be.<br />
    He spoke to his wife in the door, 'Let me see,<br />
    Mame, we don't know any good berrying place?'<br />
    It was all he could do to keep a straight face.<br />
    "If he thinks all the fruit that grows wild is for him,<br />
    He'll find he's mistaken. See here, for a whim,<br />
    We'll pick in the Mortensons' pasture this year.<br />
    We'll go in the morning, that is, if it's clear,<br />
    And the sun shines out warm: the vines must be wet.<br />
    It's so long since I picked I almost forget<br />
    How we used to pick berries: we took one look round,<br />
    Then sank out of sight like trolls underground,<br />
    And saw nothing more of each other, or heard,<br />
    Unless when you said I was keeping a bird<br />
    Away from its nest, and I said it was you.<br />
    'Well, one of us is.' For complaining it flew<br />
    Around and around us. And then for a while<br />
    We picked, till I feared you had wandered a mile,<br />
    And I thought I had lost you. I lifted a shout<br />
    Too loud for the distance you were, it turned out,<br />
    For when you made answer, your voice was as low<br />
    As talking&mdash;you stood up beside me, you know."<br />
    "We sha'n't have the place to ourselves to enjoy&mdash;<br />
    Not likely, when all the young Lorens deploy.<br />
    They'll be there to-morrow, or even to-night.<br />
    They won't be too friendly&mdash;they may be polite&mdash;<br />
    To people they look on as having no right<br />
    To pick where they're picking. But we won't complain.<br />
    You ought to have seen how it looked in the rain,<br />
    The fruit mixed with water in layers of leaves,<br />
    Like two kinds of jewels, a vision for thieves."

<h3><a id='servant'></a>A Servant to Servants</h3>
<p>
    I didn't make you know how glad I was<br />
    To have you come and camp here on our land.<br />
    I promised myself to get down some day<br />
    And see the way you lived, but I don't know!<br />
    With a houseful of hungry men to feed<br />
    I guess you'd find.... It seems to me<br />
    I can't express my feelings any more<br />
    Than I can raise my voice or want to lift<br />
    My hand (oh, I can lift it when I have to).<br />
    Did ever you feel so? I hope you never.<br />
    It's got so I don't even know for sure<br />
    Whether I am glad, sorry, or anything.<br />
    There's nothing but a voice-like left inside<br />
    That seems to tell me how I ought to feel,<br />
    And would feel if I wasn't all gone wrong.<br />
    You take the lake. I look and look at it.<br />
    I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water.<br />
    I stand and make myself repeat out loud<br />
    The advantages it has, so long and narrow,<br />
    Like a deep piece of some old running river<br />
    Cut short off at both ends. It lies five miles<br />
    Straight away through the mountain notch<br />
    From the sink window where I wash the plates,<br />
    And all our storms come up toward the house,<br />
    Drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter.<br />
    It took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit<br />
    To step outdoors and take the water dazzle<br />
    A sunny morning, or take the rising wind<br />
    About my face and body and through my wrapper,<br />
    When a storm threatened from the Dragon's Den,<br />
    And a cold chill shivered across the lake.<br />
    I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water,<br />
    Our Willoughby! How did you hear of it?<br />
    I expect, though, everyone's heard of it.<br />
    In a book about ferns? Listen to that!<br />
    You let things more like feathers regulate<br />
    Your going and coming. And you like it here?<br />
    I can see how you might. But I don't know!<br />
    It would be different if more people came,<br />
    For then there would be business. As it is,<br />
    The cottages Len built, sometimes we rent them,<br />
    Sometimes we don't. We've a good piece of shore<br />
    That ought to be worth something, and may yet.<br />
    But I don't count on it as much as Len.<br />
    He looks on the bright side of everything,<br />
    Including me. He thinks I'll be all right<br />
    With doctoring. But it's not medicine&mdash;<br />
    Lowe is the only doctor's dared to say so&mdash;<br />
    It's rest I want&mdash;there, I have said it out&mdash;<br />
    From cooking meals for hungry hired men<br />
    And washing dishes after them&mdash;from doing<br />
    Things over and over that just won't stay done.<br />
    By good rights I ought not to have so much<br />
    Put on me, but there seems no other way.<br />
    Len says one steady pull more ought to do it.<br />
    He says the best way out is always through.<br />
    And I agree to that, or in so far<br />
    As that I can see no way out but through&mdash;<br />
    Leastways for me&mdash;and then they'll be convinced.<br />
    It's not that Len don't want the best for me.<br />
    It was his plan our moving over in<br />
    Beside the lake from where that day I showed you<br />
    We used to live&mdash;ten miles from anywhere.<br />
    We didn't change without some sacrifice,<br />
    But Len went at it to make up the loss.<br />
    His work's a man's, of course, from sun to sun,<br />
    But he works when he works as hard as I do&mdash;<br />
    Though there's small profit in comparisons.<br />
    (Women and men will make them all the same.)<br />
    But work ain't all. Len undertakes too much.<br />
    He's into everything in town. This year<br />
    It's highways, and he's got too many men<br />
    Around him to look after that make waste.<br />
    They take advantage of him shamefully,<br />
    And proud, too, of themselves for doing so.<br />
    We have four here to board, great good-for-nothings,<br />
    Sprawling about the kitchen with their talk<br />
    While I fry their bacon. Much they care!<br />
    No more put out in what they do or say<br />
    Than if I wasn't in the room at all.<br />
    Coming and going all the time, they are:<br />
    I don't learn what their names are, let alone<br />
    Their characters, or whether they are safe<br />
    To have inside the house with doors unlocked.<br />
    I'm not afraid of them, though, if they're not<br />
    Afraid of me. There's two can play at that.<br />
    I have my fancies: it runs in the family.<br />
    My father's brother wasn't right. They kept him<br />
    Locked up for years back there at the old farm.<br />
    I've been away once&mdash;yes, I've been away.<br />
    The State Asylum. I was prejudiced;<br />
    I wouldn't have sent anyone of mine there;<br />
    You know the old idea&mdash;the only asylum<br />
    Was the poorhouse, and those who could afford,<br />
    Rather than send their folks to such a place,<br />
    Kept them at home; and it does seem more human.<br />
    But it's not so: the place is the asylum.<br />
    There they have every means proper to do with,<br />
    And you aren't darkening other people's lives&mdash;<br />
    Worse than no good to them, and they no good<br />
    To you in your condition; you can't know<br />
    Affection or the want of it in that state.<br />
    I've heard too much of the old-fashioned way.<br />
    My father's brother, he went mad quite young.<br />
    Some thought he had been bitten by a dog,<br />
    Because his violence took on the form<br />
    Of carrying his pillow in his teeth;<br />
    But it's more likely he was crossed in love,<br />
    Or so the story goes. It was some girl.<br />
    Anyway all he talked about was love.<br />
    They soon saw he would do someone a mischief<br />
    If he wa'n't kept strict watch of, and it ended<br />
    In father's building him a sort of cage,<br />
    Or room within a room, of hickory poles,<br />
    Like stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,&mdash;<br />
    A narrow passage all the way around.<br />
    Anything they put in for furniture<br />
    He'd tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on.<br />
    So they made the place comfortable with straw,<br />
    Like a beast's stall, to ease their consciences.<br />
    Of course they had to feed him without dishes.<br />
    They tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded<br />
    With his clothes on his arm&mdash;all of his clothes.<br />
    Cruel&mdash;it sounds. I 'spose they did the best<br />
    They knew. And just when he was at the height,<br />
    Father and mother married, and mother came,<br />
    A bride, to help take care of such a creature,<br />
    And accommodate her young life to his.<br />
    That was what marrying father meant to her.<br />
    She had to lie and hear love things made dreadful<br />
    By his shouts in the night. He'd shout and shout<br />
    Until the strength was shouted out of him,<br />
    And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion.<br />
    He'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,<br />
    And let them go and make them twang until<br />
    His hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow.<br />
    And then he'd crow as if he thought that child's play&mdash;<br />
    The only fun he had. I've heard them say, though,<br />
    They found a way to put a stop to it.<br />
    He was before my time&mdash;I never saw him;<br />
    But the pen stayed exactly as it was<br />
    There in the upper chamber in the ell,<br />
    A sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.<br />
    I often think of the smooth hickory bars.<br />
    It got so I would say&mdash;you know, half fooling&mdash;<br />
    "It's time I took my turn upstairs in jail"&mdash;<br />
    Just as you will till it becomes a habit.<br />
    No wonder I was glad to get away.<br />
    Mind you, I waited till Len said the word.<br />
    I didn't want the blame if things went wrong.<br />
    I was glad though, no end, when we moved out,<br />
    And I looked to be happy, and I was,<br />
    As I said, for a while&mdash;but I don't know!<br />
    Somehow the change wore out like a prescription.<br />
    And there's more to it than just window-views<br />
    And living by a lake. I'm past such help&mdash;<br />
    Unless Len took the notion, which he won't,<br />
    And I won't ask him&mdash;it's not sure enough.<br />
    I 'spose I've got to go the road I'm going:<br />
    Other folks have to, and why shouldn't I?<br />
    I almost think if I could do like you,<br />
    Drop everything and live out on the ground&mdash;<br />
    But it might be, come night, I shouldn't like it,<br />
    Or a long rain. I should soon get enough,<br />
    And be glad of a good roof overhead.<br />
    I've lain awake thinking of you, I'll warrant,<br />
    More than you have yourself, some of these nights.<br />
    The wonder was the tents weren't snatched away<br />
    From over you as you lay in your beds.<br />
    I haven't courage for a risk like that.<br />
    Bless you, of course, you're keeping me from work,<br />
    But the thing of it is, I need to be kept.<br />
    There's work enough to do&mdash;there's always that;<br />
    But behind's behind. The worst that you can do<br />
    Is set me back a little more behind.<br />
    I sha'n't catch up in this world, anyway.<br />
    I'd rather you'd not go unless you must.

<h3><a id='applepicking'></a>After Apple-picking</h3>
<p>
    My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree<br />
    Toward heaven still,<br />
    And there's a barrel that I didn't fill<br />
    Beside it, and there may be two or three<br />
    Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.<br />
    But I am done with apple-picking now.<br />
    Essence of winter sleep is on the night,<br />
    The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.<br />
    I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight<br />
    I got from looking through a pane of glass<br />
    I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough<br />
    And held against the world of hoary grass.<br />
    It melted, and I let it fall and break.<br />
    But I was well<br />
    Upon my way to sleep before it fell,<br />
    And I could tell<br />
    What form my dreaming was about to take.<br />
    Magnified apples appear and disappear,<br />
    Stem end and blossom end,<br />
    And every fleck of russet showing clear.<br />
    My instep arch not only keeps the ache,<br />
    It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.<br />
    I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.<br />
    And I keep hearing from the cellar bin<br />
    The rumbling sound<br />
    Of load on load of apples coming in.<br />
    For I have had too much<br />
    Of apple-picking: I am overtired<br />
    Of the great harvest I myself desired.<br />
    There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,<br />
    Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.<br />
    For all<br />
    That struck the earth,<br />
    No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,<br />
    Went surely to the cider-apple heap<br />
    As of no worth.<br />
    One can see what will trouble<br />
    This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.<br />
    Were he not gone,<br />
    The woodchuck could say whether it's like his<br />
    Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,<br />
    Or just some human sleep.

<h3><a id='code'></a>The Code</h3>
<p>
    There were three in the meadow by the brook<br />
    Gathering up windrows, piling cocks of hay,<br />
    With an eye always lifted toward the west<br />
    Where an irregular sun-bordered cloud<br />
    Darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger<br />
    Flickering across its bosom. Suddenly<br />
    One helper, thrusting pitchfork in the ground,<br />
    Marched himself off the field and home. One stayed.<br />
    The town-bred farmer failed to understand.<br />
    "What is there wrong?"<br />
    "Something you just now said."<br />
    "What did I say?"<br />
    "About our taking pains."<br />
    "To cock the hay?&mdash;because it's going to shower?<br />
    I said that more than half an hour ago.<br />
    I said it to myself as much as you."<br />
    "You didn't know. But James is one big fool.<br />
    He thought you meant to find fault with his work.<br />
    That's what the average farmer would have meant.<br />
    James would take time, of course, to chew it over<br />
    Before he acted: he's just got round to act."<br />
    "He is a fool if that's the way he takes me."<br />
    "Don't let it bother you. You've found out something.<br />
    The hand that knows his business won't be told<br />
    To do work better or faster&mdash;those two things.<br />
    I'm as particular as anyone:<br />
    Most likely I'd have served you just the same.<br />
    But I know you don't understand our ways.<br />
    You were just talking what was in your mind,<br />
    What was in all our minds, and you weren't hinting.<br />
    Tell you a story of what happened once:<br />
    I was up here in Salem at a man's<br />
    Named Sanders with a gang of four or five<br />
    Doing the haying. No one liked the boss.<br />
    He was one of the kind sports call a spider,<br />
    All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy<br />
    From a humped body nigh as big's a biscuit.<br />
    But work! that man could work, especially<br />
    If by so doing he could get more work<br />
    Out of his hired help. I'm not denying<br />
    He was hard on himself. I couldn't find<br />
    That he kept any hours&mdash;not for himself.<br />
    Daylight and lantern-light were one to him:<br />
    I've heard him pounding in the barn all night.<br />
    But what he liked was someone to encourage.<br />
    Them that he couldn't lead he'd get behind<br />
    And drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing&mdash;<br />
    Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off.<br />
    I'd seen about enough of his bulling tricks<br />
    (We call that bulling). I'd been watching him.<br />
    So when he paired off with me in the hayfield<br />
    To load the load, thinks I, Look out for trouble.<br />
    I built the load and topped it off; old Sanders<br />
    Combed it down with a rake and says, 'O. K.'<br />
    Everything went well till we reached the barn<br />
    With a big catch to empty in a bay.<br />
    You understand that meant the easy job<br />
    For the man up on top of throwing down<br />
    The hay and rolling it off wholesale,<br />
    Where on a mow it would have been slow lifting.<br />
    You wouldn't think a fellow'd need much urging<br />
    Under these circumstances, would you now?<br />
    But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands,<br />
    And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit,<br />
    Shouts like an army captain, 'Let her come!'<br />
    Thinks I, D'ye mean it? 'What was that you said?'<br />
    I asked out loud, so's there'd be no mistake,<br />
    'Did you say, Let her come?' 'Yes, let her come.'<br />
    He said it over, but he said it softer.<br />
    Never you say a thing like that to a man,<br />
    Not if he values what he is. God, I'd as soon<br />
    Murdered him as left out his middle name.<br />
    I'd built the load and knew right where to find it.<br />
    Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for<br />
    Like meditating, and then I just dug in<br />
    And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots.<br />
    I looked over the side once in the dust<br />
    And caught sight of him treading-water-like,<br />
    Keeping his head above. 'Damn ye,' I says,<br />
    'That gets ye!' He squeaked like a squeezed rat.<br />
    That was the last I saw or heard of him.<br />
    I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off.<br />
    As I sat mopping hayseed from my neck,<br />
    And sort of waiting to be asked about it,<br />
    One of the boys sings out, 'Where's the old man?'<br />
    'I left him in the barn under the hay.<br />
    If ye want him, ye can go and dig him out.'<br />
    They realized from the way I swobbed my neck<br />
    More than was needed something must be up.<br />
    They headed for the barn; I stayed where I was.<br />
    They told me afterward. First they forked hay,<br />
    A lot of it, out into the barn floor.<br />
    Nothing! They listened for him. Not a rustle.<br />
    I guess they thought I'd spiked him in the temple<br />
    Before I buried him, or I couldn't have managed.<br />
    They excavated more. 'Go keep his wife<br />
    Out of the barn.' Someone looked in a window,<br />
    And curse me if he wasn't in the kitchen<br />
    Slumped way down in a chair, with both his feet<br />
    Stuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer.<br />
    He looked so clean disgusted from behind<br />
    There was no one that dared to stir him up,<br />
    Or let him know that he was being looked at.<br />
    Apparently I hadn't buried him<br />
    (I may have knocked him down); but my just trying<br />
    To bury him had hurt his dignity.<br />
    He had gone to the house so's not to meet me.<br />
    He kept away from us all afternoon.<br />
    We tended to his hay. We saw him out<br />
    After a while picking peas in his garden:<br />
    He couldn't keep away from doing something."<br />
    "Weren't you relieved to find he wasn't dead?"<br />
    "No! and yet I don't know&mdash;it's hard to say.<br />
    I went about to kill him fair enough."<br />
    "You took an awkward way. Did he discharge you?"<br />
    "Discharge me? No! He knew I did just right."

<h3><a id='generations'></a>The Generations of Men</h3>
<p>
    A governor it was proclaimed this time,<br />
    When all who would come seeking in New Hampshire<br />
    Ancestral memories might come together.<br />
    And those of the name Stark gathered in Bow,<br />
    A rock-strewn town where farming has fallen off,<br />
    And sprout-lands flourish where the axe has gone.<br />
    Someone had literally run to earth<br />
    In an old cellar hole in a by-road<br />
    The origin of all the family there.<br />
    Thence they were sprung, so numerous a tribe<br />
    That now not all the houses left in town<br />
    Made shift to shelter them without the help<br />
    Of here and there a tent in grove and orchard.<br />
    They were at Bow, but that was not enough:<br />
    Nothing would do but they must fix a day<br />
    To stand together on the crater's verge<br />
    That turned them on the world, and try to fathom<br />
    The past and get some strangeness out of it.<br />
    But rain spoiled all. The day began uncertain,<br />
    With clouds low trailing and moments of rain that misted.<br />
    The young folk held some hope out to each other<br />
    Till well toward noon when the storm settled down<br />
    With a swish in the grass. "What if the others<br />
    Are there," they said. "It isn't going to rain."<br />
    Only one from a farm not far away<br />
    Strolled thither, not expecting he would find<br />
    Anyone else, but out of idleness.<br />
    One, and one other, yes, for there were two.<br />
    The second round the curving hillside road<br />
    Was a girl; and she halted some way off<br />
    To reconnoitre, and then made up her mind<br />
    At least to pass by and see who he was,<br />
    And perhaps hear some word about the weather.<br />
    This was some Stark she didn't know. He nodded.<br />
    "No fête to-day," he said.<br />
    "It looks that way."<br />
    She swept the heavens, turning on her heel.<br />
    "I only idled down."<br />
    "I idled down."<br />
    Provision there had been for just such meeting<br />
    Of stranger cousins, in a family tree<br />
    Drawn on a sort of passport with the branch<br />
    Of the one bearing it done in detail&mdash;<br />
    Some zealous one's laborious device.<br />
    She made a sudden movement toward her bodice,<br />
    As one who clasps her heart. They laughed together.<br />
    "Stark?" he inquired. "No matter for the proof."<br />
    "Yes, Stark. And you?"<br />
    "I'm Stark." He drew his passport.<br />
    "You know we might not be and still be cousins:<br />
    The town is full of Chases, Lowes, and Baileys,<br />
    All claiming some priority in Starkness.<br />
    My mother was a Lane, yet might have married<br />
    Anyone upon earth and still her children<br />
    Would have been Starks, and doubtless here to-day."<br />
    "You riddle with your genealogy<br />
    Like a Viola. I don't follow you."<br />
    "I only mean my mother was a Stark<br />
    Several times over, and by marrying father<br />
    No more than brought us back into the name."<br />
    "One ought not to be thrown into confusion<br />
    By a plain statement of relationship,<br />
    But I own what you say makes my head spin.<br />
    You take my card&mdash;you seem so good at such things&mdash;<br />
    And see if you can reckon our cousinship.<br />
    Why not take seats here on the cellar wall<br />
    And dangle feet among the raspberry vines?"<br />
    "Under the shelter of the family tree."<br />
    "Just so&mdash;that ought to be enough protection."<br />
    "Not from the rain. I think it's going to rain."<br />
    "It's raining."<br />
    "No, it's misting; let's be fair.<br />
    Does the rain seem to you to cool the eyes?"<br />
    The situation was like this: the road<br />
    Bowed outward on the mountain half-way up,<br />
    And disappeared and ended not far off.<br /><br />
    No one went home that way. The only house<br />
    Beyond where they were was a shattered seedpod.<br />
    And below roared a brook hidden in trees,<br />
    The sound of which was silence for the place.<br />
    This he sat listening to till she gave judgment.<br />
    "On father's side, it seems, we're&mdash;let me see&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    "Don't be too technical.&mdash;You have three cards."<br />
    "Four cards, one yours, three mine, one for each branch<br />
    Of the Stark family I'm a member of."<br />
    "D'you know a person so related to herself<br />
    Is supposed to be mad."<br />
    "I may be mad."<br />
    "You look so, sitting out here in the rain<br />
    Studying genealogy with me<br />
    You never saw before. What will we come to<br />
    With all this pride of ancestry, we Yankees?<br />
    I think we're all mad. Tell me why we're here<br />
    Drawn into town about this cellar hole<br />
    Like wild geese on a lake before a storm?<br />
    What do we see in such a hole, I wonder."<br />
    "The Indians had a myth of Chicamoztoc,<br />
    Which means The Seven Caves that We Came out of.<br />
    This is the pit from which we Starks were digged."<br />
    "You must be learned. That's what you see in it?"<br />
    "And what do you see?"<br />
    "Yes, what do I see?<br />
    First let me look. I see raspberry vines&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    "Oh, if you're going to use your eyes, just hear<br />
    What I see. It's a little, little boy,<br />
    As pale and dim as a match flame in the sun;<br />
    He's groping in the cellar after jam,<br />
    He thinks it's dark and it's flooded with daylight."<br />
    "He's nothing. Listen. When I lean like this<br />
    I can make out old Grandsir Stark distinctly,&mdash;<br />
    With his pipe in his mouth and his brown jug&mdash;<br />
    Bless you, it isn't Grandsir Stark, it's Granny,<br />
    But the pipe's there and smoking and the jug.<br />
    She's after cider, the old girl, she's thirsty;<br />
    Here's hoping she gets her drink and gets out safely."<br />
    "Tell me about her. Does she look like me?"<br />
    "She should, shouldn't she, you're so many times<br />
    Over descended from her. I believe<br />
    She does look like you. Stay the way you are.<br />
    The nose is just the same, and so's the chin&mdash;<br />
    Making allowance, making due allowance."<br />
    "You poor, dear, great, great, great, great Granny!"<br />
    "See that you get her greatness right. Don't stint her."<br />
    "Yes, it's important, though you think it isn't.<br />
    I won't be teased. But see how wet I am."<br />
    "Yes, you must go; we can't stay here for ever.<br />
    But wait until I give you a hand up.<br />
    A bead of silver water more or less<br />
    Strung on your hair won't hurt your summer looks.<br />
    I wanted to try something with the noise<br />
    That the brook raises in the empty valley.<br />
    We have seen visions&mdash;now consult the voices.<br />
    Something I must have learned riding in trains<br />
    When I was young. I used the roar<br />
    To set the voices speaking out of it,<br />
    Speaking or singing, and the band-music playing.<br />
    Perhaps you have the art of what I mean.<br />
    I've never listened in among the sounds<br />
    That a brook makes in such a wild descent.<br />
    It ought to give a purer oracle."<br />
    "It's as you throw a picture on a screen:<br />
    The meaning of it all is out of you;<br />
    The voices give you what you wish to hear."<br />
    "Strangely, it's anything they wish to give."<br />
    "Then I don't know. It must be strange enough.<br />
    I wonder if it's not your make-believe.<br />
    What do you think you're like to hear to-day?"<br />
    "From the sense of our having been together&mdash;<br />
    But why take time for what I'm like to hear?<br />
    I'll tell you what the voices really say.<br />
    You will do very well right where you are<br />
    A little longer. I mustn't feel too hurried,<br />
    Or I can't give myself to hear the voices."<br />
    "Is this some trance you are withdrawing into?"<br />
    "You must be very still; you mustn't talk."<br />
    "I'll hardly breathe."<br />
    "The voices seem to say&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    "I'm waiting."<br />
    "Don't! The voices seem to say:<br />
    Call her Nausicaa, the unafraid<br />
    Of an acquaintance made adventurously."<br />
    "I let you say that&mdash;on consideration."<br />
    "I don't see very well how you can help it.
    You want the truth. I speak but by the voices.<br />
    You see they know I haven't had your name,<br />
    Though what a name should matter between us&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    "I shall suspect&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    "Be good. The voices say:<br />
    Call her Nausicaa, and take a timber<br />
    That you shall find lies in the cellar charred<br />
    Among the raspberries, and hew and shape it<br />
    For a door-sill or other corner piece<br />
    In a new cottage on the ancient spot.<br />
    The life is not yet all gone out of it.<br />
    And come and make your summer dwelling here,<br />
    And perhaps she will come, still unafraid,<br />
    And sit before you in the open door<br />
    With flowers in her lap until they fade,<br />
    But not come in across the sacred sill&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    "I wonder where your oracle is tending.<br />
    You can see that there's something wrong with it,<br />
    Or it would speak in dialect. Whose voice<br />
    Does it purport to speak in? Not old Grandsir's<br />
    Nor Granny's, surely. Call up one of them.<br />
    They have best right to be heard in this place."<br />
    "You seem so partial to our great-grandmother<br />
    (Nine times removed. Correct me if I err.)<br />
    You will be likely to regard as sacred<br />
    Anything she may say. But let me warn you,<br />
    Folks in her day were given to plain speaking.<br />
    You think you'd best tempt her at such a time?"<br />
    "It rests with us always to cut her off."<br />
    "Well then, it's Granny speaking: 'I dunnow!<br />
    Mebbe I'm wrong to take it as I do.<br />
    There ain't no names quite like the old ones though,<br />
    Nor never will be to my way of thinking.<br />
    One mustn't bear too hard on the new comers,<br />
    But there's a dite too many of them for comfort.<br />
    I should feel easier if I could see<br />
    More of the salt wherewith they're to be salted.<br />
    Son, you do as you're told! You take the timber&mdash;<br />
    It's as sound as the day when it was cut&mdash;<br />
    And begin over&mdash;&mdash;' There, she'd better stop.<br />
    You can see what is troubling Granny, though.<br />
    But don't you think we sometimes make too much<br />
    Of the old stock? What counts is the ideals,<br />
    And those will bear some keeping still about."<br />
    "I can see we are going to be good friends."<br />
    "I like your 'going to be.' You said just now<br />
    It's going to rain."<br />
    "I know, and it was raining.<br />
    I let you say all that. But I must go now."<br />
    "You let me say it? on consideration?<br />
    How shall we say good-bye in such a case?"<br />
    "How shall we?"<br />
    "Will you leave the way to me?"<br />
    "No, I don't trust your eyes. You've said enough.<br />
    Now give me your hand up.&mdash;Pick me that flower."<br />
    "Where shall we meet again?"<br />
    "Nowhere but here<br />
    Once more before we meet elsewhere."<br />
    "In rain?"<br />
    "It ought to be in rain. Sometime in rain.<br />
    In rain to-morrow, shall we, if it rains?<br />
    But if we must, in sunshine." So she went.

<h3><a id='housekeeper'></a>The Housekeeper</h3>
<p>
    I let myself in at the kitchen door.<br />
    "It's you," she said. "I can't get up. Forgive me<br />
    Not answering your knock. I can no more<br />
    Let people in than I can keep them out.<br />
    I'm getting too old for my size, I tell them.<br />
    My fingers are about all I've the use of<br />
    So's to take any comfort. I can sew:<br />
    I help out with this beadwork what I can."<br />
    "That's a smart pair of pumps you're beading there.<br />
    Who are they for?"<br />
    "You mean?&mdash;oh, for some miss.<br />
    I can't keep track of other people's daughters.<br />
    Lord, if I were to dream of everyone<br />
    Whose shoes I primped to dance in!"<br />
    "And where's John?"<br />
    "Haven't you seen him? Strange what set you off<br />
    To come to his house when he's gone to yours.<br />
    You can't have passed each other. I know what:<br />
    He must have changed his mind and gone to Garlands.<br />
    He won't be long in that case. You can wait.<br />
    Though what good you can be, or anyone&mdash;<br />
    It's gone so far. You've heard? Estelle's run off."<br />
    "Yes, what's it all about? When did she go?"<br />
    "Two weeks since."<br />
    "She's in earnest, it appears."<br />
    "I'm sure she won't come back. She's hiding somewhere.<br />
    I don't know where myself. John thinks I do.<br />
    He thinks I only have to say the word,<br />
    And she'll come back. But, bless you, I'm her mother&mdash;<br />
    I can't talk to her, and, Lord, if I could!"<br />
    "It will go hard with John. What will he do?<br />
    He can't find anyone to take her place."<br />
    "Oh, if you ask me that, what will he do?<br />
    He gets some sort of bakeshop meals together,<br />
    With me to sit and tell him everything,<br />
    What's wanted and how much and where it is.<br />
    But when I'm gone&mdash;of course I can't stay here:<br />
    Estelle's to take me when she's settled down.<br />
    He and I only hinder one another.<br />
    I tell them they can't get me through the door, though:<br />
    I've been built in here like a big church organ.<br />
    We've been here fifteen years."<br />
    "That's a long time<br />
    To live together and then pull apart.<br />
    How do you see him living when you're gone?<br />
    Two of you out will leave an empty house."<br />
    "I don't just see him living many years,<br />
    Left here with nothing but the furniture.<br />
    I hate to think of the old place when we're gone,<br />
    With the brook going by below the yard,<br />
    And no one here but hens blowing about.<br />
    If he could sell the place, but then, he can't:<br />
    No one will ever live on it again.<br />
    It's too run down. This is the last of it.<br />
    What I think he will do, is let things smash.<br />
    He'll sort of swear the time away. He's awful!<br />
    I never saw a man let family troubles<br />
    Make so much difference in his man's affairs.<br />
    He's just dropped everything. He's like a child.<br />
    I blame his being brought up by his mother.<br />
    He's got hay down that's been rained on three times.<br />
    He hoed a little yesterday for me:<br />
    I thought the growing things would do him good.<br />
    Something went wrong. I saw him throw the hoe<br />
    Sky-high with both hands. I can see it now&mdash;<br />
    Come here&mdash;I'll show you&mdash;in that apple tree.<br />
    That's no way for a man to do at his age:<br />
    He's fifty-five, you know, if he's a day."<br />
    "Aren't you afraid of him? What's that gun for?"<br />
    "Oh, that's been there for hawks since chicken-time.<br />
    John Hall touch me! Not if he knows his friends.<br />
    I'll say that for him, John's no threatener<br />
    Like some men folk. No one's afraid of him;<br />
    All is, he's made up his mind not to stand<br />
    What he has got to stand."<br />
    "Where is Estelle?<br />
    Couldn't one talk to her? What does she say?<br />
    You say you don't know where she is."<br />
    "Nor want to!<br />
    She thinks if it was bad to live with him,<br />
    It must be right to leave him."<br />
    "Which is wrong!"<br />
    "Yes, but he should have married her."<br />
    "I know."<br />
    "The strain's been too much for her all these years:<br />
    I can't explain it any other way.<br />
    It's different with a man, at least with John:<br />
    He knows he's kinder than the run of men.<br />
    Better than married ought to be as good<br />
    As married&mdash;that's what he has always said.<br />
    I know the way he's felt&mdash;but all the same!"<br />
    "I wonder why he doesn't marry her<br />
    And end it."<br />
    "Too late now: she wouldn't have him.<br />
    He's given her time to think of something else.<br />
    That's his mistake. The dear knows my interest<br />
    Has been to keep the thing from breaking up.<br />
    This is a good home: I don't ask for better.<br />
    But when I've said, 'Why shouldn't they be married,'<br />
    He'd say, 'Why should they?' no more words than that."<br />
    "And after all why should they? John's been fair<br />
    I take it. What was his was always hers.<br />
    There was no quarrel about property."<br />
    "Reason enough, there was no property.<br />
    A friend or two as good as own the farm,<br />
    Such as it is. It isn't worth the mortgage."<br />
    "I mean Estelle has always held the purse."<br />
    "The rights of that are harder to get at.<br />
    I guess Estelle and I have filled the purse.<br />
    'Twas we let him have money, not he us.<br />
    John's a bad farmer. I'm not blaming him.<br />
    Take it year in, year out, he doesn't make much.<br />
    We came here for a home for me, you know,<br />
    Estelle to do the housework for the board<br />
    Of both of us. But look how it turns out:<br />
    She seems to have the housework, and besides,<br />
    Half of the outdoor work, though as for that,<br />
    He'd say she does it more because she likes it.<br />
    You see our pretty things are all outdoors.<br />
    Our hens and cows and pigs are always better<br />
    Than folks like us have any business with.<br />
    Farmers around twice as well off as we<br />
    Haven't as good. They don't go with the farm.<br />
    One thing you can't help liking about John,<br />
    He's fond of nice things&mdash;too fond, some would say.<br />
    But Estelle don't complain: she's like him there.<br />
    She wants our hens to be the best there are.<br />
    You never saw this room before a show,<br />
    Full of lank, shivery, half-drowned birds<br />
    In separate coops, having their plumage done.<br />
    The smell of the wet feathers in the heat!<br />
    You spoke of John's not being safe to stay with.<br />
    You don't know what a gentle lot we are:<br />
    We wouldn't hurt a hen! You ought to see us<br />
    Moving a flock of hens from place to place.<br />
    We're not allowed to take them upside down,<br />
    All we can hold together by the legs.<br />
    Two at a time's the rule, one on each arm,<br />
    No matter how far and how many times<br />
    We have to go."<br />
    "You mean that's John's idea."<br />
    "And we live up to it; or I don't know<br />
    What childishness he wouldn't give way to.<br />
    He manages to keep the upper hand<br />
    On his own farm. He's boss. But as to hens:<br />
    We fence our flowers in and the hens range.<br />
    Nothing's too good for them. We say it pays.<br />
    John likes to tell the offers he has had,<br />
    Twenty for this cock, twenty-five for that.<br />
    He never takes the money. If they're worth<br />
    That much to sell, they're worth as much to keep.<br />
    Bless you, it's all expense, though. Reach me down<br />
    The little tin box on the cupboard shelf,<br />
    The upper shelf, the tin box. That's the one.<br />
    I'll show you. Here you are."<br />
    "What's this?"<br />
    "A bill&mdash;<br />
    For fifty dollars for one Langshang cock&mdash;<br />
    Receipted. And the cock is in the yard."<br />
    "Not in a glass case, then?"<br />
    "He'd need a tall one:<br />
    He can eat off a barrel from the ground.<br />
    He's been in a glass case, as you may say,<br />
    The Crystal Palace, London. He's imported.<br />
    John bought him, and we paid the bill with beads&mdash;<br />
    Wampum, I call it. Mind, we don't complain.<br />
    But you see, don't you, we take care of him."<br />
    "And like it, too. It makes it all the worse."<br />
    "It seems as if. And that's not all: he's helpless<br />
    In ways that I can hardly tell you of.<br />
    Sometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts<br />
    To see where all the money goes so fast.<br />
    You know how men will be ridiculous.<br />
    But it's just fun the way he gets bedeviled&mdash;<br />
    If he's untidy now, what will he be&mdash;&mdash;?<br />
    "It makes it all the worse. You must be blind."<br />
    "Estelle's the one. You needn't talk to me."<br />
    "Can't you and I get to the root of it?<br />
    What's the real trouble? What will satisfy her?"<br />
    "It's as I say: she's turned from him, that's all."<br />
    "But why, when she's well off? Is it the neighbours,<br />
    Being cut off from friends?"<br />
    "We have our friends.<br />
    That isn't it. Folks aren't afraid of us."<br />
    "She's let it worry her. You stood the strain,<br />
    And you're her mother."<br />
    "But I didn't always.<br />
    I didn't relish it along at first.<br />
    But I got wonted to it. And besides&mdash;<br />
    John said I was too old to have grandchildren.<br />
    But what's the use of talking when it's done?<br />
    She won't come back&mdash;it's worse than that&mdash;she can't."<br />
    "Why do you speak like that? What do you know?<br />
    What do you mean?&mdash;she's done harm to herself?"<br />
    "I mean she's married&mdash;married someone else."<br />
    "Oho, oho!"<br />
    "You don't believe me."<br />
    "Yes, I do,<br />
    Only too well. I knew there must be something!<br />
    So that was what was back. She's bad, that's all!"<br />
    "Bad to get married when she had the chance?"<br />
    "Nonsense! See what's she done! But who, who&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    "Who'd marry her straight out of such a mess?<br />
    Say it right out&mdash;no matter for her mother.<br />
    The man was found. I'd better name no names.<br />
    John himself won't imagine who he is."<br />
    "Then it's all up. I think I'll get away.<br />
    You'll be expecting John. I pity Estelle;<br />
    I suppose she deserves some pity, too.<br />
    You ought to have the kitchen to yourself<br />
    To break it to him. You may have the job."<br />
    "You needn't think you're going to get away.<br />
    John's almost here. I've had my eye on someone<br />
    Coming down Ryan's Hill. I thought 'twas him.<br />
    Here he is now. This box! Put it away.<br />
    And this bill."<br />
    "What's the hurry? He'll unhitch."<br />
    "No, he won't, either. He'll just drop the reins<br />
    And turn Doll out to pasture, rig and all.<br />
    She won't get far before the wheels hang up<br />
    On something&mdash;there's no harm. See, there he is!<br />
    My, but he looks as if he must have heard!"<br />
    John threw the door wide but he didn't enter.<br />
    "How are you, neighbour? Just the man I'm after.<br />
    Isn't it Hell," he said. "I want to know.<br />
    Come out here if you want to hear me talk.<br />
    I'll talk to you, old woman, afterward.<br />
    I've got some news that maybe isn't news.<br />
    What are they trying to do to me, these two?"<br />
    "Do go along with him and stop his shouting."<br />
    She raised her voice against the closing door:<br />
    "Who wants to hear your news, you&mdash;dreadful fool?"
</p>

<h3><a id='fear'></a>The Fear</h3>
<p>
    A lantern light from deeper in the barn<br />
    Shone on a man and woman in the door<br />
    And threw their lurching shadows on a house<br />
    Near by, all dark in every glossy window.<br />
    A horse's hoof pawed once the hollow floor,<br />
    And the back of the gig they stood beside<br />
    Moved in a little. The man grasped a wheel,<br />
    The woman spoke out sharply, "Whoa, stand still!"<br />
    "I saw it just as plain as a white plate,"<br />
    She said, "as the light on the dashboard ran<br />
    Along the bushes at the roadside&mdash;a man's face.<br />
    You must have seen it too."<br />
    "I didn't see it.<br />
    Are you sure&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    "Yes, I'm sure!"<br />
    "&mdash;it was a face?"<br />
    "Joel, I'll have to look. I can't go in,<br />
    I can't, and leave a thing like that unsettled.<br />
    Doors locked and curtains drawn will make no difference.<br />
    I always have felt strange when we came home<br />
    To the dark house after so long an absence,<br />
    And the key rattled loudly into place<br />
    Seemed to warn someone to be getting out<br />
    At one door as we entered at another.<br />
    What if I'm right, and someone all the time&mdash;<br />
    Don't hold my arm!"<br />
    "I say it's someone passing."<br />
    "You speak as if this were a travelled road.<br />
    You forget where we are. What is beyond<br />
    That he'd be going to or coming from<br />
    At such an hour of night, and on foot too.<br />
    What was he standing still for in the bushes?"<br />
    "It's not so very late&mdash;it's only dark.<br />
    There's more in it than you're inclined to say.<br />
    Did he look like&mdash;&mdash;?"<br />
    "He looked like anyone.<br />
    I'll never rest to-night unless I know.<br />
    Give me the lantern."<br />
    "You don't want the lantern."<br />
    She pushed past him and got it for herself.<br />
    "You're not to come," she said. "This is my business.<br />
    If the time's come to face it, I'm the one<br />
    To put it the right way. He'd never dare&mdash;<br />
    Listen! He kicked a stone. Hear that, hear that!<br />
    He's coming towards us. Joel, go in&mdash;please.<br />
    Hark!&mdash;I don't hear him now. But please go in."<br />
    "In the first place you can't make me believe it's&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    "It is&mdash;or someone else he's sent to watch.<br />
    And now's the time to have it out with him<br />
    While we know definitely where he is.<br />
    Let him get off and he'll be everywhere<br />
    Around us, looking out of trees and bushes<br />
    Till I sha'n't dare to set a foot outdoors.<br />
    And I can't stand it. Joel, let me go!"<br />
    "But it's nonsense to think he'd care enough."<br />
    "You mean you couldn't understand his caring.<br />
    Oh, but you see he hadn't had enough&mdash;<br />
    Joel, I won't&mdash;I won't&mdash;I promise you.<br />
    We mustn't say hard things. You mustn't either."<br />
    "I'll be the one, if anybody goes!<br />
    But you give him the advantage with this light.<br />
    What couldn't he do to us standing here!<br />
    And if to see was what he wanted, why<br />
    He has seen all there was to see and gone."<br />
    He appeared to forget to keep his hold,<br />
    But advanced with her as she crossed the grass.<br />
    "What do you want?" she cried to all the dark.<br />
    She stretched up tall to overlook the light<br />
    That hung in both hands hot against her skirt.<br />
    "There's no one; so you're wrong," he said.<br />
    "There is.&mdash;<br />
    What do you want?" she cried, and then herself<br />
    Was startled when an answer really came.<br />
    "Nothing." It came from well along the road.<br />
    She reached a hand to Joel for support:<br />
    The smell of scorching woollen made her faint.<br />
    "What are you doing round this house at night?"<br />
    "Nothing." A pause: there seemed no more to say.<br />
    And then the voice again: "You seem afraid.<br />
    I saw by the way you whipped up the horse.<br />
    I'll just come forward in the lantern light<br />
    And let you see."<br />
    "Yes, do.&mdash;Joel, go back!"<br />
    She stood her ground against the noisy steps<br />
    That came on, but her body rocked a little.<br />
    "You see," the voice said.<br />
    "Oh." She looked and looked.<br />
    "You don't see&mdash;I've a child here by the hand."<br />
    "What's a child doing at this time of night&mdash;&mdash;?"<br />
    "Out walking. Every child should have the memory<br />
    Of at least one long-after-bedtime walk.<br />
    What, son?"<br />
    "Then I should think you'd try to find<br />
    Somewhere to walk&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    "The highway as it happens&mdash;<br />
    We're stopping for the fortnight down at Dean's."<br />
    "But if that's all&mdash;Joel&mdash;you realize&mdash;<br />
    You won't think anything. You understand?<br />
    You understand that we have to be careful.<br />
    This is a very, very lonely place.<br />
    Joel!" She spoke as if she couldn't turn.<br />
    The swinging lantern lengthened to the ground,<br />
    It touched, it struck it, clattered and went out.

<h3><a id='selfseeker'></a>The Self-seeker</h3>
<p>
    "Willis, I didn't want you here to-day:<br />
    The lawyer's coming for the company.<br />
    I'm going to sell my soul, or, rather, feet.<br />
    Five hundred dollars for the pair, you know."<br />
    "With you the feet have nearly been the soul;<br />
    And if you're going to sell them to the devil,<br />
    I want to see you do it. When's he coming?"<br />
    "I half suspect you knew, and came on purpose<br />
    To try to help me drive a better bargain."<br />
    "Well, if it's true! Yours are no common feet.<br />
    The lawyer don't know what it is he's buying:<br />
    So many miles you might have walked you won't walk.<br />
    You haven't run your forty orchids down.<br />
    What does he think?&mdash;How are the blessed feet?<br />
    The doctor's sure you're going to walk again?"<br />
    "He thinks I'll hobble. It's both legs and feet."<br />
    "They must be terrible&mdash;I mean to look at."<br />
    "I haven't dared to look at them uncovered.<br />
    Through the bed blankets I remind myself<br />
    Of a starfish laid out with rigid points."<br />
    "The wonder is it hadn't been your head."<br />
    "It's hard to tell you how I managed it.<br />
    When I saw the shaft had me by the coat,<br />
    I didn't try too long to pull away,<br />
    Or fumble for my knife to cut away,<br />
    I just embraced the shaft and rode it out&mdash;<br />
    Till Weiss shut off the water in the wheel-pit.<br />
    That's how I think I didn't lose my head.<br />
    But my legs got their knocks against the ceiling."<br />
    "Awful. Why didn't they throw off the belt<br />
    Instead of going clear down in the wheel-pit?"<br />
    "They say some time was wasted on the belt&mdash;<br />
    Old streak of leather&mdash;doesn't love me much<br />
    Because I make him spit fire at my knuckles,<br />
    The way Ben Franklin used to make the kite-string.<br />
    That must be it. Some days he won't stay on.<br />
    That day a woman couldn't coax him off.<br />
    He's on his rounds now with his tail in his mouth<br />
    Snatched right and left across the silver pulleys.<br />
    Everything goes the same without me there.<br />
    You can hear the small buzz saws whine, the big saw<br />
    Caterwaul to the hills around the village<br />
    As they both bite the wood. It's all our music.<br />
    One ought as a good villager to like it.<br />
    No doubt it has a sort of prosperous sound,<br />
    And it's our life."<br />
    "Yes, when it's not our death."<br />
    "You make that sound as if it wasn't so<br />
    With everything. What we live by we die by.<br />
    I wonder where my lawyer is. His train's in.<br />
    I want this over with; I'm hot and tired."<br />
    "You're getting ready to do something foolish."<br />
    "Watch for him, will you, Will? You let him in.<br />
    I'd rather Mrs. Corbin didn't know;<br />
    I've boarded here so long, she thinks she owns me.<br />
    You're bad enough to manage without her."<br />
    "And I'm going to be worse instead of better.<br />
    You've got to tell me how far this is gone:<br />
    Have you agreed to any price?"<br />
    "Five hundred.<br />
    Five hundred&mdash;five&mdash;five! One, two, three, four, five.<br />
    You needn't look at me."<br />
    "I don't believe you."<br />
    "I told you, Willis, when you first came in.<br />
    Don't you be hard on me. I have to take<br />
    What I can get. You see they have the feet,<br />
    Which gives them the advantage in the trade.<br />
    I can't get back the feet in any case."<br />
    "But your flowers, man, you're selling out your flowers."<br />
    "Yes, that's one way to put it&mdash;all the flowers<br />
    Of every kind everywhere in this region<br />
    For the next forty summers&mdash;call it forty.<br />
    But I'm not selling those, I'm giving them,<br />
    They never earned me so much as one cent:<br />
    Money can't pay me for the loss of them.<br />
    No, the five hundred was the sum they named<br />
    To pay the doctor's bill and tide me over.<br />
    It's that or fight, and I don't want to fight&mdash;<br />
    I just want to get settled in my life,<br />
    Such as it's going to be, and know the worst,<br />
    Or best&mdash;it may not be so bad. The firm<br />
    Promise me all the shooks I want to nail."<br />
    "But what about your flora of the valley?"<br />
    "You have me there. But that&mdash;you didn't think<br />
    That was worth money to me? Still I own<br />
    It goes against me not to finish it<br />
    For the friends it might bring me. By the way,<br />
    I had a letter from Burroughs&mdash;did I tell you?&mdash;<br />
    About my Cyprepedium reginæ;<br />
    He says it's not reported so far north.<br />
    There! there's the bell. He's rung. But you go down<br />
    And bring him up, and don't let Mrs. Corbin.&mdash;<br />
    Oh, well, we'll soon be through with it. I'm tired."<br />
    Willis brought up besides the Boston lawyer<br />
    A little barefoot girl who in the noise<br />
    Of heavy footsteps in the old frame house,<br />
    And baritone importance of the lawyer,<br />
    Stood for a while unnoticed with her hands<br />
    Shyly behind her.<br />
    "Well, and how is Mister&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    The lawyer was already in his satchel<br />
    As if for papers that might bear the name<br />
    He hadn't at command. "You must excuse me,<br />
    I dropped in at the mill and was detained."<br />
    "Looking round, I suppose," said Willis.<br />
    "Yes,<br />
    Well, yes."<br />
    "Hear anything that might prove useful?"<br />
    The Broken One saw Anne. "Why, here is Anne.<br />
    What do you want, dear? Come, stand by the bed;<br />
    Tell me what is it?" Anne just wagged her dress<br />
    With both hands held behind her. "Guess," she said.<br />
    "Oh, guess which hand? My my! Once on a time<br />
    I knew a lovely way to tell for certain<br />
    By looking in the ears. But I forget it.<br />
    Er, let me see. I think I'll take the right.<br />
    That's sure to be right even if it's wrong.<br />
    Come, hold it out. Don't change.&mdash;A Ram's Horn orchid!<br />
    A Ram's Horn! What would I have got, I wonder,<br />
    If I had chosen left. Hold out the left.<br />
    Another Ram's Horn! Where did you find those,<br />
    Under what beech tree, on what woodchuck's knoll?"<br />
    Anne looked at the large lawyer at her side,<br />
    And thought she wouldn't venture on so much.<br />
    "Were there no others?"<br />
    "There were four or five.<br />
    I knew you wouldn't let me pick them all."<br />
    "I wouldn't&mdash;so I wouldn't. You're the girl!<br />
    You see Anne has her lesson learned by heart."<br />
    "I wanted there should be some there next year."<br />
    "Of course you did. You left the rest for seed,<br />
    And for the backwoods woodchuck. You're the girl!<br />
    A Ram's Horn orchid seedpod for a woodchuck<br />
    Sounds something like. Better than farmer's beans<br />
    To a discriminating appetite,<br />
    Though the Ram's Horn is seldom to be had<br />
    In bushel lots&mdash;doesn't come on the market.<br />
    But, Anne, I'm troubled; have you told me all?<br />
    You're hiding something. That's as bad as lying.<br />
    You ask this lawyer man. And it's not safe<br />
    With a lawyer at hand to find you out.<br />
    Nothing is hidden from some people, Anne.<br />
    You don't tell me that where you found a Ram's Horn<br />
    You didn't find a Yellow Lady's Slipper.<br />
    What did I tell you? What? I'd blush, I would.<br />
    Don't you defend yourself. If it was there,<br />
    Where is it now, the Yellow Lady's Slipper?"<br />
    "Well, wait&mdash;it's common&mdash;it's too common."<br />
    "Common?<br />
    The Purple Lady's Slipper's commoner."<br />
    "I didn't bring a Purple Lady's Slipper<br />
    To You&mdash;to you I mean&mdash;they're both too common."<br />
    The lawyer gave a laugh among his papers<br />
    As if with some idea that she had scored.<br />
    "I've broken Anne of gathering bouquets.<br />
    It's not fair to the child. It can't be helped though:<br />
    Pressed into service means pressed out of shape.<br />
    Somehow I'll make it right with her&mdash;she'll see.<br />
    She's going to do my scouting in the field,<br />
    Over stone walls and all along a wood<br />
    And by a river bank for water flowers,<br />
    The floating Heart, with small leaf like a heart,<br />
    And at the sinus under water a fist<br />
    Of little fingers all kept down but one,<br />
    And that thrust up to blossom in the sun<br />
    As if to say, 'You! You're the Heart's desire.'<br />
    Anne has a way with flowers to take the place<br />
    Of that she's lost: she goes down on one knee<br />
    And lifts their faces by the chin to hers<br />
    And says their names, and leaves them where they are."<br />
    The lawyer wore a watch the case of which<br />
    Was cunningly devised to make a noise<br />
    Like a small pistol when he snapped it shut<br />
    At such a time as this. He snapped it now.<br />
    "Well, Anne, go, dearie. Our affair will wait.<br />
    The lawyer man is thinking of his train.<br />
    He wants to give me lots and lots of money<br />
    Before he goes, because I hurt myself,<br />
    And it may take him I don't know how long.<br />
    But put our flowers in water first. Will, help her:<br />
    The pitcher's too full for her. There's no cup?<br />
    Just hook them on the inside of the pitcher.<br />
    Now run.&mdash;Get out your documents! You see<br />
    I have to keep on the good side of Anne.<br />
    I'm a great boy to think of number one.<br />
    And you can't blame me in the place I'm in.<br />
    Who will take care of my necessities<br />
    Unless I do?"<br />
    "A pretty interlude,"<br />
    The lawyer said. "I'm sorry, but my train&mdash;<br />
    Luckily terms are all agreed upon.<br />
    You only have to sign your name. Right&mdash;there."<br />
    "You, Will, stop making faces. Come round here<br />
    Where you can't make them. What is it you want?<br />
    I'll put you out with Anne. Be good or go."<br />
    "You don't mean you will sign that thing unread?"<br />
    "Make yourself useful then, and read it for me.<br />
    Isn't it something I have seen before?"<br />
    "You'll find it is. Let your friend look at it."<br />
    "Yes, but all that takes time, and I'm as much<br />
    In haste to get it over with as you.<br />
    But read it, read it. That's right, draw the curtain:<br />
    Half the time I don't know what's troubling me.&mdash;<br />
    What do you say, Will? Don't you be a fool,<br />
    You! crumpling folkses legal documents.<br />
    Out with it if you've any real objection."<br />
    "Five hundred dollars!"<br />
    "What would you think right?"<br />
    "A thousand wouldn't be a cent too much;<br />
    You know it, Mr. Lawyer. The sin is<br />
    Accepting anything before he knows<br />
    Whether he's ever going to walk again.<br />
    It smells to me like a dishonest trick."<br />
    "I think&mdash;I think&mdash;from what I heard to-day&mdash;<br />
    And saw myself&mdash;he would be ill-advised&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    "What did you hear, for instance?" Willis said.<br />
    "Now the place where the accident occurred&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    The Broken One was twisted in his bed.<br />
    "This is between you two apparently.<br />
    Where I come in is what I want to know.<br />
    You stand up to it like a pair of cocks.<br />
    Go outdoors if you want to fight. Spare me.<br />
    When you come back, I'll have the papers signed.<br />
    Will pencil do? Then, please, your fountain pen.<br />
    One of you hold my head up from the pillow."<br />
    Willis flung off the bed. "I wash my hands&mdash;<br />
    I'm no match&mdash;no, and don't pretend to be&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
    The lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen.<br />
    "You're doing the wise thing: you won't regret it.<br />
    We're very sorry for you."<br />
    Willis sneered:<br />
    "Who's we?&mdash;some stockholders in Boston?<br />
    I'll go outdoors, by gad, and won't come back."<br />
    "Willis, bring Anne back with you when you come.<br />
    Yes. Thanks for caring. Don't mind Will: he's savage.<br />
    He thinks you ought to pay me for my flowers.<br />
    You don't know what I mean about the flowers.<br />
    Don't stop to try to now. You'll miss your train.<br />
    Good-bye." He flung his arms around his face.

<h3><a id='woodpile'></a>The Wood-pile</h3>
<p>
    Out walking in the frozen swamp one grey day<br />
    I paused and said, "I will turn back from here.<br />
    No, I will go on farther&mdash;and we shall see."<br />
    The hard snow held me, save where now and then<br />
    One foot went down. The view was all in lines<br />
    Straight up and down of tall slim trees<br />
    Too much alike to mark or name a place by<br />
    So as to say for certain I was here<br />
    Or somewhere else: I was just far from home.<br />
    A small bird flew before me. He was careful<br />
    To put a tree between us when he lighted,<br />
    And say no word to tell me who he was<br />
    Who was so foolish as to think what he thought.<br />
    He thought that I was after him for a feather&mdash;<br />
    The white one in his tail; like one who takes<br />
    Everything said as personal to himself.<br />
    One flight out sideways would have undeceived him.<br />
    And then there was a pile of wood for which<br />
    I forgot him and let his little fear<br />
    Carry him off the way I might have gone,<br />
    Without so much as wishing him good-night.<br />
    He went behind it to make his last stand.<br />
    It was a cord of maple, cut and split<br />
    And piled&mdash;and measured, four by four by eight.<br />
    And not another like it could I see.<br />
    No runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.<br />
    And it was older sure than this year's cutting,<br />
    Or even last year's or the year's before.<br />
    The wood was grey and the bark warping off it<br />
    And the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis<br />
    Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle.<br />
    What held it though on one side was a tree<br />
    Still growing, and on one a stake and prop,<br />
    These latter about to fall. I thought that only<br />
    Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks<br />
    Could so forget his handiwork on which<br />
    He spent himself, the labour of his axe,<br />
    And leave it there far from a useful fireplace<br />
    To warm the frozen swamp as best it could<br />
    With the slow smokeless burning of decay.
</p>

<h3><a id='hours'></a>Good Hours</h3>
<p>
    I had for my winter evening walk&mdash;<br />
    No one at all with whom to talk,<br />
    But I had the cottages in a row<br />
    Up to their shining eyes in snow.<br />
    And I thought I had the folk within:<br />
    I had the sound of a violin;<br />
    I had a glimpse through curtain laces<br />
    Of youthful forms and youthful faces.<br />
    I had such company outward bound.<br />
    I went till there were no cottages found.<br />
    I turned and repented, but coming back<br />
    I saw no window but that was black.<br />
    Over the snow my creaking feet<br />
    Disturbed the slumbering village street<br />
    Like profanation, by your leave,<br />
    At ten o'clock of a winter eve.

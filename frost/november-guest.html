<h1>November Guest</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
My sorrow, when she's here with me,<br />
Thinks these dark days of autumn rain<br />
Are beautiful as days can be;<br />
She loves the bare, the withered tree;<br />
She walks the sodden pasture lane.<br />
Her pleasure will not let me stay.<br />
She talks and I am fain to list:<br />
She's glad the birds are gone away,<br />
She's glad her simple worsted gray<br />
Is silver now with clinging mist.<br />
The desolate, deserted trees,<br />
The faded earth, the heavy sky,<br />
The beauties she so truly sees,<br />
She thinks I have no eye for these,<br />
And vexes me for reason why.<br />
Not yesterday I learned to know<br />
The love of bare November days<br />
Before the coming of the snow,<br />
But it were vain to tell her so,<br />
And they are better for her praise.

<h1>The Flood</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
Blood has been harder to dam back than water.<br/>
Just when we think we have it impounded safe<br/>
Behind new barrier walls (and let it chafe!),<br/>
It breaks away in some new kind of slaughter.<br/>
We choose to say it is let loose by the devil;<br/>
But power of blood itself releases blood.<br/>
It goes by might of being such a flood<br/>
Held high at so unnatural a level.<br/>
It will have outlet, brave and not so brave.<br/>
Weapons of war and implements of peace<br/>
Are but the points at which it finds release.<br/>
And now it is once more the tidal wave<br/>
That when it has swept by leaves summits stained.<br/>
Oh, blood will out. It cannot be contained.

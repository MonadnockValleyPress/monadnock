<h1>On Going Unnoticed</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
<p>
As vain to raise a voice as a sigh<br/>
In the tumult of free leaves on high.<br/>
What are you, in the shadow of trees<br/>
Engaged up there with the light and breeze?
</p>
<p>
Less than the coralroot, you know,<br/>
That is content with the daylight low,<br/>
And has no leaves at all of its own;<br/>
Whose spotted flowers hang meanly down.
</p>
<p>
You grasp the bark by a rugged pleat,<br/>
And look up small from the forest's feet.<br/>
The only leaf it drops goes wide,<br/>
Your name not written on either side.
</p>
<p>
You linger your little hour and are gone,<br/>
And still the woods sweep leafily on,<br/>
Not even missing the coralroot flower<br/>
You took as a trophy of the hour.

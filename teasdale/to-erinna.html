<h1>To Erinna</h1>
<h2>by Sara Teasdale</h2>
<p>
Was Time not harsh to you, or was he kind,<br/>
O pale Erinna of the perfect lyre,<br/>
That he has left no word of singing fire<br/>
Whereby you waked the dreaming Lesbian wind,<br/>
And kindled night along the lyric shore?<br/>
O girl whose lips Erato stooped to kiss,<br/>
Do you go sorrowing because of this<br/>
In fields where poets sing forevermore?<br/>
Or are you glad and is it best to be<br/>
A silent music men have never heard,<br/>
A dream in all our souls that we may say:<br/>
"Her voice had all the rapture of the sea,<br/>
And all the clear cool quiver of a bird<br/>
Deep in a forest at the break of day"?

<h1>Appraisal</h1>
<h2>by Sara Teasdale</h2>
<p>
Never think she loves him wholly,<br/>
Never believe her love is blind,<br/>
All his faults are locked securely<br/>
In a closet of her mind;<br/>
All his indecisions folded<br/>
Like old flags that time has faded,<br/>
Limp and streaked with rain,<br/>
And his cautiousness like garments<br/>
Frayed and thin, with many a stain&mdash;<br/>
Let them be, oh let them be,<br/>
There is treasure to outweigh them,<br/>
His proud will that sharply stirred,<br/>
Climbs as surely as the tide,<br/>
Senses strained too taut to sleep,<br/>
Gentleness to beast and bird,<br/>
Humor flickering hushed and wide<br/>
As the moon on moving water,<br/>
And a tenderness too deep<br/>
To be gathered in a word.

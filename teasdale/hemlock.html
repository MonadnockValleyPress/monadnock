<h1>The Wind in the Hemlock</h1>
<h2>by Sara Teasdale</h2>
<p>
Steely stars and moon of brass,<br/>
How mockingly you watch me pass!<br/>
You know as well as I how soon<br/>
I shall be blind to stars and moon,<br/>
Deaf to the wind in the hemlock tree,<br/>
Dumb when the brown earth weighs on me.
</p>
<p>
With envious dark rage I bear,<br/>
Stars, your cold complacent stare;<br/>
Heart-broken in my hate look up,<br/>
Moon, at your clear immortal cup,<br/>
Changing to gold from dusky red&mdash;<br/>
Age after age when I am dead<br/>
To be filled up with light, and then<br/>
Emptied, to be refilled again.
</p>
<p>
What has man done that only he<br/>
Is slave to death&mdash;so brutally<br/>
Beaten back into the earth<br/>
Impatient for him since his birth?
</p>
<p>
Oh let me shut my eyes, close out<br/>
The sight of stars and earth and be<br/>
Sheltered a minute by this tree.<br/>
Hemlock, through your fragrant boughs<br/>
There moves no anger and no doubt,<br/>
No envy of immortal things.<br/>
The night-wind murmurs of the sea<br/>
With veiled music ceaselessly,<br/>
That to my shaken spirit sings.<br/>
From their frail nest the robins rouse,<br/>
In your pungent darkness stirred,<br/>
Twittering a low drowsy word&mdash;<br/>
And me you shelter, even me.<br/>
In your quietness you house<br/>
The wind, the woman and the bird.<br/>
You speak to me and I have heard:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am peaceful, I shall see<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beauty's face continually;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeding on her wine and bread<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be wholly comforted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For she can make one day for me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich as my lost eternity.

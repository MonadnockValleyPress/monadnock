<h1>From the North</h1>
<h2>by Sara Teasdale</h2>
<p>
The northern woods are delicately sweet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The lake is folded softly by the shore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am restless for the subway's roar,<br/>
The thunder and the hurrying of feet.<br/>
I try to sleep, but still my eyelids beat<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the image of the tower that bore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Me high aloft, as if thru heaven's door<br/>
I watched the world from God's unshaken seat.<br/>
I would go back and breathe with quickened sense<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The tunnel's strong hot breath of powdered steel;<br/>
But at the ferries I should leave the tense<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dark air behind, and I should mount and be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One among many who are thrilled to feel<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first keen sea-breath from the open sea.

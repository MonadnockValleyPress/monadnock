<h1>For the Anniversary of John Keats' Death</h1>
<h2>by Sara Teasdale</h2>
<p>
At midnight when the moonlit cypress trees<br/>
Have woven round his grave a magic shade,<br/>
Still weeping the unfinished hymn he made,<br/>
There moves fresh Maia like a morning breeze<br/>
Blown over jonquil beds when warm rains cease.<br/>
And stooping where her poet's head is laid,<br/>
Selene weeps while all the tides are stayed<br/>
And swaying seas are darkened into peace.<br/>
But they who wake the meadows and the tides<br/>
Have hearts too kind to bid him wake from sleep<br/>
Who murmurs sometimes when his dreams are deep,<br/>
Startling the Quiet Land where he abides,<br/>
And charming still, sad-eyed Persephone<br/>
With visions of the sunny earth and sea.

<h1>On a March Day</h1>
<h2>by Sara Teasdale</h2>
<p>
Here in the teeth of this triumphant wind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That shakes the naked shadows on the ground,<br/>
Making a key-board of the earth to strike<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From clattering tree and hedge a separate sound,
</p>
<p>
Bear witness for me that I loved my life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All things that hurt me and all things that healed,<br/>
And that I swore to it this day in March,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here at the edge of this new-broken field.
</p>
<p>
You only knew me, tell them that I was glad<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For every hour since my hour of birth,<br/>
And that I ceased to fear, as once I feared,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The last complete reunion with the earth.

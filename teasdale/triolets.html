<h1>Triolets</h1>
<h2>by Sara Teasdale</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
Love looked back as he took his flight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo, his eyes were filled with tears.<br/>
Was it for love of lost delight<br/>
Love looked back as he took his flight?<br/>
Only I know while day grew night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning still to the vanished years,<br/>
Love looked back as he took his flight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo, his eyes were filled with tears.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>(Written in a copy of <cite>La Vita Nuova</cite>. For M. C. S.)</p>
<p>
If you were Lady Beatrice<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I the Florentine,<br/>
I'd never waste my time like this&mdash;<br/>
If you were Lady Beatrice<br/>
I'd woo and then demand a kiss,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor weep like Dante here, I ween,<br/>
If you were Lady Beatrice<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I the Florentine.
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>(Written in a copy of <cite>The Poems of Sappho</cite>.)</p>
<p>
Beyond the dim Hesperides,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl who sang them long ago<br/>
Could never dream that over seas,<br/>
Beyond the dim Hesperides,<br/>
The wind would blow such songs as these&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder now if she can know,<br/>
Beyond the dim Hesperides,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl who sang them long ago?
</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>
Dead leaves upon the stream<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And dead leaves on the air&mdash;<br/>
All of my lost hopes seem<br/>
Dead leaves upon the stream;<br/>
I watch them in a dream,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Going I know not where,<br/>
Dead leaves upon the stream<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And dead leaves on the air.

<h1>The Solitary</h1>
<h2>by Sara Teasdale</h2>
<p>
My heart has grown rich with the passing of years,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have less need now than when I was young<br/>
To share myself with every comer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or shape my thoughts into words with my tongue.
</p>
<p>
It is one to me that they come or go<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have myself and the drive of my will,<br/>
And strength to climb on a summer night<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And watch the stars swarm over the hill.
</p>
<p>
Let them think I love them more than I do,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them think I care, though I go alone;<br/>
If it lifts their pride, what is it to me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who am self-complete as a flower or a stone.

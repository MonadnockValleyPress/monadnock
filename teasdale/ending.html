<h1>Day's Ending</h1>
<h2>by Sara Teasdale</h2>
<p>(Tucson)</p>
<p>
Aloof as aged kings,<br/>
Wearing like them the purple,<br/>
The mountains ring the mesa<br/>
Crowned with a dusky light;<br/>
Many a time I watched<br/>
That coming-on of darkness<br/>
Till stars burned through the heavens<br/>
Intolerably bright.
</p>
<p>
It was not long I lived there<br/>
But I became a woman<br/>
Under those vehement stars,<br/>
For it was there I heard<br/>
For the first time my spirit<br/>
Forging an iron rule for me,<br/>
As though with slow cold hammers<br/>
Beating out word by word:
</p>
<p>
"Only yourself can heal you,<br/>
Only yourself can lead you,<br/>
The road is heavy going<br/>
And ends where no man knows;<br/>
Take love when love is given,<br/>
But never think to find it<br/>
A sure escape from sorrow<br/>
Or a complete repose."
</p>

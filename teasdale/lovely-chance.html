<h1>Lovely Chance</h1>
<h2>by Sara Teasdale</h2>
<p>
O lovely chance, what can I do<br/>
To give my gratefulness to you?<br/>
You rise between myself and me<br/>
With a wise persistency;<br/>
I would have broken body and soul,<br/>
But by your grace, still I am whole.<br/>
Many a thing you did to save me,<br/>
Many a holy gift you gave me,<br/>
Music and friends and happy love<br/>
More than my dearest dreaming of;<br/>
And now in this wide twilight hour<br/>
With earth and heaven a dark, blue flower,<br/>
In a humble mood I bless<br/>
Your wisdom&mdash;and your waywardness.<br/>
You brought me even here, where I<br/>
Live on a hill against the sky<br/>
And look on mountains and the sea<br/>
And a thin white moon in the pepper tree.

<h1>Songs out of Sorrow</h1>
<h2>by Sara Teasdale</h2>
<h3>I. Spirit's House</h3>
<p>
From naked stones of agony<br/>
I will build a house for me;<br/>
As a mason all alone<br/>
I will raise it, stone by stone,<br/>
And every stone where I have bled<br/>
Will show a sign of dusky red.<br/>
I have not gone the way in vain,<br/>
For I have good of all my pain;<br/>
My spirit's quiet house will be<br/>
Built of naked stones I trod<br/>
On roads where I lost sight of God.
</p>
<h3>II. Mastery</h3>
<p>
I would not have a god come in<br/>
To shield me suddenly from sin,<br/>
And set my house of life to rights;<br/>
Nor angels with bright burning wings<br/>
Ordering my earthly thoughts and things;<br/>
Rather my own frail guttering lights<br/>
Wind blown and nearly beaten out;<br/>
Rather the terror of the nights<br/>
And long, sick groping after doubt;<br/>
Rather be lost than let my soul<br/>
Slip vaguely from my own control&mdash;<br/>
Of my own spirit let me be<br/>
In sole though feeble mastery.
</p>
<h3>III. Lessons</h3>
<p>
Unless I learn to ask no help<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From any other soul but mine,<br/>
To seek no strength in waving reeds<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor shade beneath a straggling pine;<br/>
Unless I learn to look at Grief<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unshrinking from her tear-blind eyes,<br/>
And take from Pleasure fearlessly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever gifts will make me wise&mdash;<br/>
Unless I learn these things on earth,<br/>
Why was I ever given birth?
</p>
<h3>IV. Wisdom</h3>
<p>
When I have ceased to break my wings<br/>
Against the faultiness of things,<br/>
And learned that compromises wait<br/>
Behind each hardly opened gate,<br/>
When I can look Life in the eyes,<br/>
Grown calm and very coldly wise,<br/>
Life will have given me the Truth,<br/>
And taken in exchange&mdash;my youth.
</p>
<h3>V. In a Burying Ground</h3>
<p>
This is the spot where I will lie<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When life has had enough of me,<br/>
These are the grasses that will blow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Above me like a living sea.
</p>
<p>
These gay old lilies will not shrink<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To draw their life from death of mine,<br/>
And I will give my body's fire<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To make blue flowers on this vine.
</p>
<p>
"O Soul," I said, "have you no tears?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not the body dear to you?"<br/>
I heard my soul say carelessly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"The myrtle flowers will grow more blue."
</p>
<h3>VI. Wood Song</h3>
<p>
I heard a wood thrush in the dusk<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Twirl three notes and make a star&mdash;<br/>
My heart that walked with bitterness<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Came back from very far.
</p>
<p>
Three shining notes were all he had,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet they made a starry call&mdash;<br/>
I caught life back against my breast<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And kissed it, scars and all.
</p>
<h3>VII. Refuge</h3>
<p>
From my spirit's gray defeat,<br/>
From my pulse's flagging beat,<br/>
From my hopes that turned to sand<br/>
Sifting through my close-clenched hand,<br/>
From my own fault's slavery,<br/>
If I can sing, I still am free.
</p>
<p>
For with my singing I can make<br/>
A refuge for my spirit's sake,<br/>
A house of shining words, to be<br/>
My fragile immortality.

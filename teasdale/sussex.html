<h1>On the Sussex Downs</h1>
<h2>by Sara Teasdale</h2>
<p>
Over the downs there were birds flying,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Far off glittered the sea,<br/>
And toward the north the weald of Sussex<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay like a kingdom under me.
</p>
<p>
I was happier than the larks<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That nest on the downs and sing to the sky,<br/>
Over the downs the birds flying<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were not so happy as I.
</p>
<p>
It was not you, though you were near,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though you were good to hear and see,<br/>
It was not earth, it was not heaven,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was myself that sang in me.

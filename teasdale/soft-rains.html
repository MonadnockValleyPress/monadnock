<h1>There Will Come Soft Rains</h1>
<h2>by Sara Teasdale</h2>
<p>(War Time)</p>
<p>
There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,<br/>
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;
</p>
<p>
And frogs in the pools singing at night,<br/>
And wild plum-trees in tremulous white;
</p>
<p>
Robins will wear their feathery fire<br/>
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;
</p>
<p>
And not one will know of the war, not one<br/>
Will care at last when it is done.
</p>
<p>
Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree<br/>
If mankind perished utterly;
</p>
<p>
And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,<br/>
Would scarcely know that we were gone.
</p>

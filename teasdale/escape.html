<h1>Since There Is No Escape</h1>
<h2>by Sara Teasdale</h2>
<p>
Since there is no escape, since at the end<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My body will be utterly destroyed,<br/>
This hand I love as I have loved a friend,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This body I tended, wept with and enjoyed;<br/>
Since there is no escape even for me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who love life with a love too sharp to bear:<br/>
The scent of orchards in the rain, the sea<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hours alone too still and sure for prayer&mdash;<br/>
Since darkness waits for me, then all the more<br/>
Let me go down as waves sweep to the shore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In pride; and let me sing with my last breath;<br/>
In these few hours of light I lift my head;<br/>
Life is my lover&mdash;I shall leave the dead<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any way to baffle death.

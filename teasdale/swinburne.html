<h1>On the Death of Swinburne</h1>
<h2>by Sara Teasdale</h2>
<p>
He trod the earth but yesterday,<br/>
And now he treads the stars.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He left us in the April time<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He praised so often in his rhyme,<br/>
He left the singing and the lyre and went his way.
</p>
<p>
He drew new music from our tongue,<br/>
A music subtly wrought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And moulded words to his desire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As wind doth mould a wave of fire;<br/>
From strangely fashioned harps slow golden tones he wrung.
</p>
<p>
I think the singing understands<br/>
That he who sang is still,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Iseult cries that he is dead,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Does not Dolores bow her head<br/>
And Fragoletta weep and wring her little hands?
</p>
<p>
New singing now the singer hears<br/>
To lyre and lute and harp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Catullus waits to welcome him,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thro' the twilight sweet and dim,<br/>
Sappho's forgotten songs are falling on his ears.

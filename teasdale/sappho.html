<h1>Sappho</h1>
<h2>by Sara Teasdale</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
Midnight, and in the darkness not a sound,<br/>
So, with hushed breathing, sleeps the autumn night;<br/>
Only the white immortal stars shall know,<br/>
Here in the house with the low-lintelled door,<br/>
How, for the last time, I have lit the lamp.<br/>
I think you are not wholly careless now,<br/>
Walls that have sheltered me so many an hour,<br/>
Bed that has brought me ecstasy and sleep,<br/>
Floors that have borne me when a gale of joy<br/>
Lifted my soul and made me half a god.<br/>
Farewell! Across the threshold many feet<br/>
Shall pass, but never Sappho's feet again.<br/>
Girls shall come in whom love has made aware<br/>
Of all their swaying beauty&mdash;they shall sing,<br/>
But never Sappho's voice, like golden fire,<br/>
Shall seek for heaven thru your echoing rafters.<br/>
There shall be swallows bringing back the spring<br/>
Over the long blue meadows of the sea,<br/>
And south-wind playing on the reeds of rain,<br/>
But never Sappho's whisper in the night,<br/>
Never her love-cry when the lover comes.<br/>
Farewell! I close the door and make it fast.
</p>
<p>
The little street lies meek beneath the moon,<br/>
Running, as rivers run, to meet the sea.<br/>
I too go seaward and shall not return.<br/>
Oh garlands on the doorposts that I pass,<br/>
Woven of asters and of autumn leaves,<br/>
I make a prayer for you: Cypris be kind,<br/>
That every lover may be given love.<br/>
I shall not hasten lest the paving stones<br/>
Should echo with my sandals and awake<br/>
Those who are warm beneath the cloak of sleep,<br/>
Lest they should rise and see me and should say,<br/>
"Whither goes Sappho lonely in the night?"<br/>
Whither goes Sappho? Whither all men go,<br/>
But they go driven, straining back with fear,<br/>
And Sappho goes as lightly as a leaf<br/>
Blown from brown autumn forests to the sea.
</p>
<p>
Here on the rock Zeus lifted from the waves,<br/>
I shall await the waking of the dawn,<br/>
Lying beneath the weight of dark as one<br/>
Lies breathless, till the lover shall awake.<br/>
And with the sun the sea shall cover me&mdash;<br/>
I shall be less than the dissolving foam<br/>
Murmuring and melting on the ebbing tide;<br/>
I shall be less than spindrift, less than shells;<br/>
And yet I shall be greater than the gods,<br/>
For destiny no more can bow my soul<br/>
As rain bows down the watch-fires on the hills.<br/>
Yes, if my soul escape it shall aspire<br/>
To the white heaven as flame that has its will.<br/>
I go not bitterly, not dumb with pain,<br/>
Not broken by the ache of love&mdash;I go<br/>
As one grown tired lies down and hopes to sleep.<br/>
Yet they shall say: "It was for Cercolas;<br/>
She died because she could not bear her love."<br/>
They shall remember how we used to walk<br/>
Here on the cliff beneath the oleanders<br/>
In the long limpid twilight of the spring,<br/>
Looking toward Lemnos, where the amber sky<br/>
Was pierced with the faint arrow of a star.<br/>
How should they know the wind of a new beauty<br/>
Sweeping my soul had winnowed it with song?<br/>
I have been glad tho' love should come or go,<br/>
Happy as trees that find a wind to sway them,<br/>
Happy again when it has left them rest.<br/>
Others shall say, "Grave Dica wrought her death.<br/>
She would not lift her lips to take a kiss,<br/>
Or ever lift her eyes to take a smile.<br/>
She was a pool the winter paves with ice<br/>
That the wild hunter in the hills must leave<br/>
With thirst unslaked in the brief southward sun."<br/>
Ah Dica, it is not for thee I go;<br/>
And not for Phaon, tho' his ship lifts sail<br/>
Here in the windless harbor for the south.<br/>
Oh, darkling deities that guard the Nile,<br/>
Watch over one whose gods are far away.<br/>
Egypt, be kind to him, his eyes are deep&mdash;<br/>
Yet they are wrong who say it was for him.<br/>
How should they know that Sappho lived and died<br/>
Faithful to love, not faithful to the lover,<br/>
Never transfused and lost in what she loved,<br/>
Never so wholly loving nor at peace.<br/>
I asked for something greater than I found,<br/>
And every time that love has made me weep,<br/>
I have rejoiced that love could be so strong;<br/>
For I have stood apart and watched my soul<br/>
Caught in the gust of passion, as a bird<br/>
With baffled wings against the dusty whirlwind<br/>
Struggles and frees itself to find the sky.<br/>
It is not for a single god I go;<br/>
I have grown weary of the winds of heaven.<br/>
I will not be a reed to hold the sound<br/>
Of whatsoever breath the gods may blow,<br/>
Turning my torment into music for them.<br/>
They gave me life; the gift was bountiful,<br/>
I lived with the swift singing strength of fire,<br/>
Seeking for beauty as a flame for fuel&mdash;<br/>
Beauty in all things and in every hour.<br/>
The gods have given life&mdash;I gave them song;<br/>
The debt is paid and now I turn to go.
</p>
<p>
The breath of dawn blows the stars out like lamps,<br/>
There is a rim of silver on the sea,<br/>
As one grown tired who hopes to sleep, I go.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
Oh Litis, little slave, why will you sleep?<br/>
These long Egyptian noons bend down your head<br/>
Bowed like the yarrow with a yellow bee.<br/>
There, lift your eyes no man has ever kindled,<br/>
Dark eyes that wait like faggots for the fire.<br/>
See how the temple's solid square of shade<br/>
Points north to Lesbos, and the splendid sea<br/>
That you have never seen, oh evening-eyed.<br/>
Yet have you never wondered what the Nile<br/>
Is seeking always, restless and wild with spring<br/>
And no less in the winter, seeking still?<br/>
How shall I tell you? Can you think of fields<br/>
Greater than Gods could till, more blue than night<br/>
Sown over with the stars; and delicate<br/>
With filmy nets of foam that come and go?<br/>
It is more cruel and more compassionate<br/>
Than harried earth. It takes with unconcern<br/>
And quick forgetting, rapture of the rain<br/>
And agony of thunder, the moon's white<br/>
Soft-garmented virginity, and then<br/>
The insatiable ardor of the sun.<br/>
And me it took. But there is one more strong,<br/>
Love, that came laughing from the elder seas,<br/>
The Cyprian, the mother of the world;<br/>
She gave me love who only asked for death&mdash;<br/>
I who had seen much sorrow in men's eyes<br/>
And in my own too sorrowful a fire.<br/>
I was a sister of the stars, and yet<br/>
Shaken with pain; sister of birds and yet<br/>
The wings that bore my soul were very tired.<br/>
I watched the careless spring too many times<br/>
Light her green torches in a hungry wind;<br/>
Too many times I watched them flare, and then<br/>
Fall to forsaken embers in the autumn.<br/>
And I was sick of all things&mdash;even song.<br/>
In the dull autumn dawn I turned to death,<br/>
Buried my living body in the sea,<br/>
The strong cold sea that takes and does not give&mdash;<br/>
But there is one more strong, the Cyprian.<br/>
Litis, to wake from sleep and find your eyes<br/>
Met in their first fresh upward gaze by love,<br/>
Filled with love's happy shame from other eyes,<br/>
Dazzled with tenderness and drowned in light<br/>
As tho' you looked unthinking at the sun,<br/>
Oh Litis, that is joy! But if you came<br/>
Not from the sunny shallow pool of sleep,<br/>
But from the sea of death, the strangling sea<br/>
Of night and nothingness, and waked to find<br/>
Love looking down upon you, glad and still,<br/>
Strange and yet known forever, that is peace.<br/>
So did he lean above me. Not a word<br/>
He spoke; I only heard the morning sea<br/>
Singing against his happy ship, the keen<br/>
And straining joy of wind-awakened sails<br/>
And songs of mariners, and in myself<br/>
The precious pain of arms that held me fast.<br/>
They warmed the cold sea out of all my blood;<br/>
I slept, feeling his eyes above my sleep.<br/>
There on the ship with wines and olives laden,<br/>
Led by the stars to far invisible ports,<br/>
Egypt and islands of the inner seas,<br/>
Love came to me, and Cercolas was love.
</p>
<h3>III From <cite>Helen of Troy and Other Poems</cite></h3>
<p>
The twilight's inner flame grows blue and deep,<br/>
And in my Lesbos, over leagues of sea,<br/>
The temples glimmer moon-wise in the trees.<br/>
Twilight has veiled the little flower-face<br/>
Here on my heart, but still the night is kind<br/>
And leaves her warm sweet weight against my breast.<br/>
Am I that Sappho who would run at dusk<br/>
Along the surges creeping up the shore<br/>
When tides came in to ease the hungry beach,<br/>
And running, running till the night was black,<br/>
Would fall forespent upon the chilly sand<br/>
And quiver with the winds from off the sea?<br/>
Ah quietly the shingle waits the tides<br/>
Whose waves are stinging kisses, but to me<br/>
Love brought no peace, nor darkness any rest.<br/>
I crept and touched the foam with fevered hands<br/>
And cried to Love, from whom the sea is sweet,<br/>
From whom the sea is bitterer than death.<br/>
Ah, Aphrodite, if I sing no more<br/>
To thee, God's daughter, powerful as God,<br/>
It is that thou hast made my life too sweet<br/>
To hold the added sweetness of a song.<br/>
There is a quiet at the heart of love,<br/>
And I have pierced the pain and come to peace.<br/>
I hold my peace, my Cle&iuml;s, on my heart;<br/>
And softer than a little wild bird's wing<br/>
Are kisses that she pours upon my mouth.<br/>
Ah never any more when spring like fire<br/>
Will flicker in the newly opened leaves,<br/>
Shall I steal forth to seek for solitude<br/>
Beyond the lure of light Alcaeus' lyre,<br/>
Beyond the sob that stilled Erinna's voice.<br/>
Ah, never with a throat that aches with song,<br/>
Beneath the white uncaring sky of spring,<br/>
Shall I go forth to hide awhile from Love<br/>
The quiver and the crying of my heart.<br/>
Still I remember how I strove to flee<br/>
The love-note of the birds, and bowed my head<br/>
To hurry faster, but upon the ground<br/>
I saw two wing&egrave;d shadows side by side,<br/>
And all the world's spring passion stifled me.<br/>
Ah, Love there is no fleeing from thy might,<br/>
No lonely place where thou hast never trod,<br/>
No desert thou hast left uncarpeted<br/>
With flowers that spring beneath thy perfect feet.<br/>
In many guises didst thou come to me;<br/>
I saw thee by the maidens while they danced,<br/>
Phaon allured me with a look of thine,<br/>
In Anactoria I knew thy grace,<br/>
I looked at Cercolas and saw thine eyes;<br/>
But never wholly, soul and body mine,<br/>
Didst thou bid any love me as I loved.<br/>
Now have I found the peace that fled from me;<br/>
Close, close against my heart I hold my world.<br/>
Ah, Love that made my life a lyric cry,<br/>
Ah, Love that tuned my lips to lyres of thine,<br/>
I taught the world thy music, now alone<br/>
I sing for one who falls asleep to hear.

<h1>Ascent of Mount Ventoux</h1>
<h2>by Petrarch (~1336)</h2>
<h2>translated by James Harvey Robinson (1898)</h2>
<p>Today I made the ascent of the highest mountain in this region, which is not improperly called Ventosum.  My only motive was the wish to see what so great an elevation had to offer.  I have had the expedition in mind for many years; for, as you know, I have lived in this region from infancy, having been cast here by that fate which determines the affairs of men.  Consequently the mountain, which is visible from a great distance, was ever before my eyes, and I conceived the plan of some time doing what I have at last accomplished today. The idea took hold upon me with especial force when, in re-reading Livy's <em>History of Rome,</em> yesterday, I happened upon the place where Philip of Macedon, the same who waged war against the Romans, ascended Mount Haemus in Thessaly, from whose summit he was able, it is said, to see two seas, the Adriatic and the Euxine.  Whether this be true or false I have not been able to determine, for the mountain is too far away, and writers disagree.  Pomponius Mela, the cosmographer &mdash; not to mention others who have spoken of this occurrence &mdash; admits its truth without hesitation; Titus Livius, on the other hand, considers it false.  I, assuredly, should not have left the question long in doubt, had that mountain been as easy to explore as this one.  Let us leave this matter one side, however, and return to my mountain here &mdash; it seems to me that a young man in private life may well be excused for attempting what an aged king could undertake without arousing criticism.</p>
<P>When I came to look about for a companion I found, strangely enough, that hardly one among my friends seemed suitable, so rarely do we meet with just the right combination of personal tastes and characteristics, even among those who are dearest to us.  This one was too apathetic, that one over-anxious; this one too slow, that one too hasty; one was too sad, another over-cheerful; one more simple, another more sagacious, than I desired.  I feared this one's taciturnity and that one's loquacity.  The heavy deliberation of some repelled me as much as the lean incapacity of others. I rejected those who were likely to irritate me by a cold want of interest, as well as those who might weary me by their excessive enthusiasm.  Such defects, however grave, could be borne with at home, for charity suffereth all things, and friendship accepts any burden; but it is quite otherwise on a journey, where every weakness becomes much more serious. So, as I was bent upon pleasure and anxious that my enjoyment should be unalloyed, I looked about me with unusual care, balanced against one another the various characteristics of my friends, and without committing any breach of friendship I silently condemned every trait which might prove disagreeable on the way.  And &mdash; would you believe it? &mdash; I finally turned homeward for aid, and proposed the ascent to my only brother, who is younger than I, and with whom you are well acquainted.  He was delighted and gratified beyond measure by the thought of holding the place of a friend as well as of a brother.
<p>At the time fixed we left the house, and by evening reached Malaucene, which lies at the foot of the mountain, to the north.  Having rested there a day, we finally made the ascent this morning, with no companions except two servants; and a most difficult task it was.  The mountain is a very steep and almost inaccessible mass of stony soil. But, as the poet has well said, "Remorseless toil conquers all."  It was a long day, the air fine.  We enjoyed the advantages of vigour of mind and strength and agility of body, and everything else essential to those engaged in such an undertaking and so had no other difficulties to face than those of the region itself.  We found an old shepherd in one of the mountain dales, who tried, at great length, to dissuade us from the ascent, saying that some fifty years before he had, in the same ardour of youth, reached the summit, but had gotten for his pains nothing except fatigue and regret, and clothes and body torn by the rocks and briars.  No one, so far as he or his companions knew, had ever tried the ascent before or after him.  But his counsels increased rather than diminished our desire to proceed, since youth is suspicious of warnings.  So the old man, finding that his efforts were in vain, went a little way with us, and pointed out a rough path among the rocks, uttering many admonitions, which he continued to send after us even after we had left him behind.  Surrendering to him all such garments or other possessions as might prove burdensome to us, we made ready for the ascent, and started off at a good pace. But, as usually happens, fatigue quickly followed upon our excessive exertion, and we soon came to a halt at the top of a certain cliff.  Upon starting on again we went more slowly, and I especially advanced along the rocky way with a more deliberate step.  While my brother chose a direct path straight up the ridge, I weakly took an easier one which really descended.  When I was called back, and the right road was shown me, I replied that I hoped to find a better way round on the other side, and that I did not mind going farther if the path were only less steep.  This was just an excuse for my laziness; and when the others had already reached a considerable height I was still wandering in the valleys.  I had failed to find an easier path, and had only increased the distance and difficulty of the ascent.  At last I became disgusted with the intricate way I had chosen, and resolved to ascend without more ado.  When I reached my brother, who, while waiting for me, had had ample opportunity for rest, I was tired and irritated.  We walked along together for a time, but hardly had we passed the first spur when I forgot about the circuitous route which I had just tried, and took a lower one again.  Once more I followed an easy, roundabout path through winding valleys, only to find myself soon in my old difficulty.  I was simply trying to avoid the exertion of the ascent; but no human ingenuity can alter the nature of things, or cause anything to reach a height by going down. Suffice it to say that, much to my vexation and my brother's amusement, I made this same mistake three times or more during a few hours.</p>
<p>After being frequently misled in this way, I finally sat down in a valley and transferred my winged thoughts from things corporeal to the immaterial, addressing myself as follows: &mdash; "What thou hast repeatedly experienced today in the ascent of this mountain, happens to thee, as to many, in the journey toward the blessed life.  But this is not so readily perceived by men, since the motions of the body are obvious and external while those of the soul are invisible and hidden. Yes, the life which we call blessed is to be sought for on a high eminence, and strait is the way that leads to it.  Many, also, are the hills that lie between, and we must ascend, by a glorious stairway, from strength to strength. At the top is at once the end of our struggles and the goal for which we are bound. All wish to reach this goal, but, as Ovid says, 'To wish is little; we must long with the utmost eagerness to gain our end.'  Thou certainly dost ardently desire, as well as simply wish, unless thou deceivest thyself in this matter, as in so many others.  What, then, doth hold thee back?  Nothing, assuredly, except that thou wouldst take a path which seems, at first thought, more easy, leading through low and worldly pleasures.  But nevertheless in the end, after long wanderings, thou must perforce either climb the steeper path, under the burden of tasks foolishly deferred, to its blessed culmination, or lie down in the valley of thy sins, and (I shudder to think of it!), if the shadow of death overtake thee, spend an eternal night amid constant torments."  These thoughts stimulated both body and mind in a wonderful degree for facing the difficulties which yet remained.  Oh, that I might traverse in spirit that other road for which I long day and night, even as today I overcame material obstacles by my bodily exertions!  And I know not why it should not be far easier, since the swift immortal soul can reach its goal in the twinkling of an eye, without passing through space, while my progress today was necessarily show, dependent as I was upon a failing body weighed down by heavy members.</p>
<p>One peak of the mountain, the highest of all, the country people call "Sonny," why, I do not know, unless by antiphrasis, as I have sometimes suspected in other instances; for the peak in question would seem to be the father of all the surrounding ones.  On its top is a little level place, and here we could at last rest our tired bodies.</p>
<p>Now, my father, since you have followed the thoughts that spurred me on in my ascent, listen to the rest of the story, and devote one hour, I pray you, to reviewing the experiences of my entire day. At first, owing to the unaccustomed quality of the air and the effect of the great sweep of view spread out before me, I stood like one dazed.  I beheld the clouds under our feet, and what I had read of Athos and Olympus seemed less incredible as I myself witnessed the same things from a mountain of less fame.  I turned my eyes toward Italy, whither my heart most inclined.  The Alps, rugged and snow-capped, seemed to rise close by, although they were really at a great distance; the very same Alps through which that fierce enemy of the Roman name once made his way, bursting the rocks, if we may believe the report, by the application of vinegar.  I sighed, I must confess, for the skies of Italy, which I beheld rather with my mind than with my eyes.  An inexpressible longing came over rne to see once more my friend and my country.  At the same time I reproached myself for this double weakness, springing, as it did, from a soul not yet steeled to manly resistance.  And yet there were excuses for both of these cravings, and a number of distinguished writers might be summoned to support me.</p>
<p>Then a new idea took possession of me, and I shifted my thoughts to a consideration of time rather than place.  "Today it is ten years since, having completed thy youthful studies, thou didst leave Bologna. Eternal God! In the name of immutable wisdom, think what alterations in thy character this intervening period has beheld!  I pass over a thousand instances.  I am not yet in a safe harbour where I can calmly recall past storms. The time may come when I can review in due order all the experiences of the past, saying with St. Augustine, 'I desire to recall my foul actions and the carnal corruption of my soul, not because I love them, but that I may the more love thee, 0 my God.'  Much that is doubtful and evil still clings to me, but what I once loved, that I hove no longer.  And yet what am I saying?  I still love it, but with shame, but with heaviness of heart.  Now, at last, I have confessed the truth.  So it is.  I love, but love what I would not love, what I would that I might hate.  Though loath to do so, though constrained, though sad and sorrowing, still I do love, and I feel in my miserable self the truth of the well known words, 'I will hate if I can; if not, I will love against my will.' Three years have not yet passed since that perverse and wicked passion which had a firm grasp upon me and held undisputed sway in my heart began to discover a rebellious opponent, who was unwilling longer to yield obedience.  These two adversaries have joined in close combat for the supremacy, and for a long time now a harassing and doubtful war has been waged in the field of my thoughts."</p>
<p>Thus I turned over the last ten years in my mind, and then, fixing my anxious gaze on the future, I asked myself, "If, perchance, thou shouldst prolong this uncertain life of thine for yet two lustres, and shouldst make an advance toward virtue proportionate to the distance to which thou hast departed from thine original infatuation during the past two years, since the new longing first encountered the old, couldst thou, on reaching thy fortieth year, face death, if not with complete assurance, at least with hopefulness, calmly dismissing from thy thoughts the residuum of life as it faded into old age?"</p>
<p>These and similar reflections occurred to me, my father.  I rejoiced in my progress, mourned my weaknesses, and commiserated the universal instability of human conduct.  I had well-nigh forgotten where I was and our object in coming; but at last I dismissed my anxieties, which were better suited to other surroundings, and resolved to look about me and see what we had come to see.  The sinking sun and the lengthening shadows of the mountain were already warning us that the time was near at hand when we must go.  As if suddenly wakened from sleep, I turned about and gazed toward the west. I was unable to discern the summits of the Pyrenees, which form the barrier between France and Spain; not because of any intervening obstacle that I know of but owing simply to the insufficiency of our mortal vision.  But I could see with the utmost clearness, off to the right, the mountains of the region about Lyons, and to the left the bay of Marseilles and the waters that lash the shores of Aigues Mortes, altho' all these places were so distant that it would require a journey of several days to reach them. Under our very eyes flowed the Rhone.</p>
<p>While I was thus dividing my thoughts, now turning my attention to some terrestrial object that lay before me, now raising my soul, as I had done my body, to higher planes, it occurred to me to look into my copy of St. Augustine's <em>Confessions,</em> a gift that I owe to your love, and that I always have about me, in memory of both the author and the giver.  I opened the compact little volume, small indeed in size, but of infinite charm, with the intenition of reading whatever came to hand, for I could happen upon nothing that would be otherwise than edifying and devout.  Now it chanced that the tenth book presented itself.  My brother, waiting to hear something of St. Augustine's from my lips, stood attentively by.  I call him, and God too, to witness that where I first fixed my eyes it was written: "And men go about to wonder at the heights of the mountains, and the mighty waves of the sea, and the wide sweep of rivers, and the circuit of the ocean, and the revolution of the stars, but themselves they consider not."  I was abashed, and, asking my brother (who was anxious to hear more), not to annoy me, I closed the book, angry with myself that I should still be admiring earthly things who might long ago have learned from even the pagan philosophers that nothing is wonderful but the soul, which, when great itself, finds nothing great outside itself. Then, in truth, I was satisfied that I had seen enough of the mountain; I turned my inward eye upon myself, and from that time not a syllable fell from my lips until we reached the bottom again.  Those words had given me occupation enough, for I could not believe that it was by a mere accident that I happened upon them.  What I had there read I believed to be addressed to me and to no other, remembering that St. Augustine had once suspected the same thing in his own case, when, on opening the book of the Apostle, as he himself tells us, the first words that he saw there were, "Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.  But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof."</p>
<p>The same thing happened earlier to St. Anthony, when he was listening to the Gospel where it is written, "If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me."  Believing this scripture to have been read for his especial benefit, as his biographer Athanasius says, he guided himself by its aid to the Kingdom of Heaven.  And as Anthony on hearing these words waited for nothing more, and as Augustine upon reading the Apostle's admonition sought no farther, so I concluded my reading in the few words which I have given.  I thought in silence of the lack of good cousel in us mortals, who neglect what is noblest in ourselves, scatter our energies in all directions, and waste ourselves in a vain show, because we look about us for what is to be found only within.  I wondered at the natural nobility of our soul, save when it debases itself of its own free will, and deserts its original estate, turning what God has given it for its honour into dishonour.  How many times, think you, did I turn back that day, to glance at the summit of the mountain  which seemed scarcely a cubit high compared with the range of human contemplation &mdash; when it is not immersed in the foul mire of earth? With every downward step I asked myself this: If we are ready to endure so much sweat and labour in order that we may bring our bodies a little nearer heaven, how can a soul struggling toward God, up the steeps of human pride and human destiny, fear any cross or prison or sting of fortune?  How few, I thought, but are diverted from their path by the fear of difficulties or the love of ease!  How happy the lot of those few, if any such there be!  It is of them, assuredly, that the poet was thinking, when he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
Happy the man who is skilled to understand<br/>
Nature's hid causes; who beneath his feet<br/>
All terrors casts, and death's relentless doom,<br/>
And the loud roar of greedy Acheron.
</blockquote>
<p>How earnestly should we strive, not to stand on mountain-tops, but to trample beneath us those appetites which spring from earthhly impulses.</p>
<p>With no consciousness of the difficulties of the way, amidst these preoccupations which I have so frankly revealed, we came, long after dark, but with the full moon lending us its friendly light, to the little inn which we had left that morning before dawn.  The time during which the servants have been occupied in preparing our supper, I have spent in a secluded part of the house, hurriedly jotting down these experiences on the spur of the moment, lest, in case my task were postponed, my mood should change on leaving the place, and so my interest in writing flag.</p>
<p>You will see, my dearest father, that I wish nothing to be concealed from you, for I am careful to describe to you not only my life in general but even my individual reflections.  And I beseech you, in turn,  to pray that these vague and wandering thoughts of mine may some time become firmly fixed, and, after having been vainly tossed about from one interest to another, may direct themselves at last toward the single, true, certain, and everlasting good.</p>

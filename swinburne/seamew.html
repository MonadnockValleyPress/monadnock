<h1>To a Seamew</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
When I had wings, my brother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such wings were mine as thine:<br/>
Such life my heart remembers<br/>
In all as wild Septembers<br/>
As this when life seems other,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though sweet, than once was mine;<br/>
When I had wings, my brother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such wings were mine as thine.
</p>
<p>
Such life as thrills and quickens<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence of thy flight,<br/>
Or fills thy note's elation<br/>
With lordlier exultation<br/>
Than man's, whose faint heart sickens<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With hopes and fears that blight<br/>
Such life as thrills and quickens<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence of thy flight.
</p>
<p>
Thy cry from windward clanging<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes all the cliffs rejoice;<br/>
Though storm clothe seas with sorrow,<br/>
Thy call salutes the morrow;<br/>
While shades of pain seem hanging<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Round earth's most rapturous voice,<br/>
Thy cry from windward clanging<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes all the cliffs rejoice.
</p>
<p>
We, sons and sires of seamen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose home is all the sea,<br/>
What place man may, we claim it;<br/>
But thine&mdash;whose thought may name it?<br/>
Free birds live higher than freemen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And gladlier ye than we&mdash;<br/>
We, sons and sires of seamen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose home is all the sea.
</p>
<p>
For you the storm sounds only<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More notes of more delight<br/>
Than earth's in sunniest weather:<br/>
When heaven and sea together<br/>
Join strengths against the lonely<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost bark borne down by night,<br/>
For you the storm sounds only<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More notes of more delight.
</p>
<p>
With wider wing, and louder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Long clarion-call of joy,<br/>
Thy tribe salutes the terror<br/>
Of darkness, wild as error,<br/>
But sure as truth, and prouder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than waves with man for toy;<br/>
With wider wing, and louder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Long clarion-call of joy.
</p>
<p>
The wave's wing spreads and flutters,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wave's heart swells and breaks;<br/>
One moment's passion thrills it,<br/>
One pulse of power fulfils it<br/>
And ends the pride it utters<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When, loud with life that quakes,<br/>
The wave's wing spreads and flutters,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wave's heart swells and breaks.
</p>
<p>
But thine and thou, my brother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep heart and wing more high<br/>
Than aught may scare or sunder;<br/>
The waves whose throats are thunder<br/>
Fall hurtling each on other,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And triumph as they die;<br/>
But thine and thou, my brother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep heart and wing more high.
</p>
<p>
More high than wrath or anguish,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More strong than pride or fear,<br/>
The sense or soul half hidden<br/>
In thee, for us forbidden,<br/>
Bids thee nor change nor languish,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But live thy life as here,<br/>
More high than wrath or anguish,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More strong than pride or fear.
</p>
<p>
We are fallen, even we, whose passion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On earth is nearest thine;<br/>
Who sing, and cease from flying;<br/>
Who live, and dream of dying:<br/>
Grey time, in time's grey fashion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bids wingless creatures pine:<br/>
We are fallen, even we, whose passion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On earth is nearest thine.
</p>
<p>
The lark knows no such rapture,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such joy no nightingale,<br/>
As sways the songless measure<br/>
Wherein thy wings take pleasure:<br/>
Thy love may no man capture,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy pride may no man quail;<br/>
The lark knows no such rapture,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such joy no nightingale.
</p>
<p>
And we, whom dreams embolden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We can but creep and sing<br/>
And watch through heaven's waste hollow<br/>
The flight no sight may follow<br/>
To the utter bourne beholden<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of none that lack thy wing:<br/>
And we, whom dreams embolden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We can but creep and sing.
</p>
<p>
Our dreams have wings that falter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hearts bear hopes that die;<br/>
For thee no dream could better<br/>
A life no fears may fetter,<br/>
A pride no care can alter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That wots not whence or why<br/>
Our dreams have wings that falter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hearts bear hopes that die.
</p>
<p>
With joy more fierce and sweeter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than joys we deem divine<br/>
Their lives, by time untarnished,<br/>
Are girt about and garnished,<br/>
Who match the wave's full metre<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And drink the wind's wild wine<br/>
With joy more fierce and sweeter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than joys we deem divine.
</p>
<p>
Ah, well were I for ever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wouldst thou change lives with me,<br/>
And take my song's wild honey,<br/>
And give me back thy sunny<br/>
Wide eyes that weary never,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wings that search the sea;<br/>
Ah, well were I for ever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wouldst thou change lives with me.

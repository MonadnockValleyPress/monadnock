<h1>Astrophel</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>After Reading Sir Philip Sidney'S Arcadia in the Garden of an Old English Manor House</h3>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
A star in the silence that follows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The song of the death of the sun<br/>
Speaks music in heaven, and the hollows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And heights of the world are as one;<br/>
One lyre that outsings and outlightens<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapture of sunset, and thrills<br/>
Mute night till the sense of it brightens<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul that it fills.
</p>
<p>
The flowers of the sun that is sunken<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang heavy of heart as of head;<br/>
The bees that have eaten and drunken<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of their sweetness are fled;<br/>
But a sunflower of song, on whose honey<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My spirit has fed as a bee,<br/>
Makes sunnier than morning was sunny<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twilight for me.
</p>
<p>
The letters and lines on the pages<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That sundered mine eyes and the flowers<br/>
Wax faint as the shadows of ages<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That sunder their season and ours;<br/>
As the ghosts of the centuries that sever<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A season of colourless time<br/>
From the days whose remembrance is ever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they were, sublime.
</p>
<p>
The season that bred and that cherished<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul that I commune with yet,<br/>
Had it utterly withered and perished<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To rise not again as it set,<br/>
Shame were it that Englishmen living<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should read as their forefathers read<br/>
The books of the praise and thanksgiving<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Englishmen dead.
</p>
<p>
O light of the land that adored thee<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And kindled thy soul with her breath,<br/>
Whose life, such as fate would afford thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was lovelier than aught but thy death,<br/>
By what name, could thy lovers but know it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Might love of thee hail thee afar,<br/>
Philisides, Astrophel, poet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose love was thy star?
</p>
<p>
A star in the moondawn of Maytime,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A star in the cloudland of change;<br/>
Too splendid and sad for the daytime<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To cheer or eclipse or estrange;<br/>
Too sweet for tradition or vision<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see but through shadows of tears<br/>
Rise deathless across the division<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of measureless years.
</p>
<p>
The twilight may deepen and harden<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As nightward the stream of it runs<br/>
Till starshine transfigure a garden<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose radiance responds to the sun's:<br/>
The light of the love of thee darkens<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights that arise and that set:<br/>
The love that forgets thee not hearkens<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If England forget.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
Bright and brief in the sight of grief and love the light of thy lifetime shone,<br/>
Seen and felt by the gifts it dealt, the grace it gave, and again was gone:<br/>
Ay, but now it is death, not thou, whom time has conquered as years pass on.
</p>
<p>
Ay, not yet may the land forget that bore and loved thee and praised and wept,<br/>
Sidney, lord of the stainless sword, the name of names that her heart's love kept<br/>
Fast as thine did her own, a sign to light thy life till it sank and slept.
</p>
<p>
Bright as then for the souls of men thy brave Arcadia resounds and shines,<br/>
Lit with love that beholds above all joys and sorrows the steadfast signs,<br/>
Faith, a splendour that hope makes tender, and truth, whose presage the soul divines.
</p>
<p>
All the glory that girds the story of all thy life as with sunlight round,<br/>
All the spell that on all souls fell who saw thy spirit, and held them bound,<br/>
Lives for all that have heard the call and cadence yet of its music sound.
</p>
<p>
Music bright as the soul of light, for wings an eagle, for notes a dove,<br/>
Leaps and shines from the lustrous lines wherethrough thy soul from afar above<br/>
Shone and sang till the darkness rang with light whose fire is the fount of love.
</p>
<p>
Love that led thee alive, and fed thy soul with sorrows and joys and fears,<br/>
Love that sped thee, alive and dead, to fame's fair goal with thy peerless peers,<br/>
Feeds the flame of thy quenchless name with light that lightens the rayless years.
</p>
<p>
Dark as sorrow though night and morrow may lower with presage of clouded fame,<br/>
How may she that of old bare thee, may Sidney's England, be brought to shame?<br/>
How should this be, while England is? What need of answer beyond thy name?
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
From the love that transfigures thy glory,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the light of the dawn of thy death,<br/>
The life of thy song and thy story<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Took subtler and fierier breath.<br/>
And we, though the day and the morrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Set fear and thanksgiving at strife,<br/>
Hail yet in the star of thy sorrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun of thy life.
</p>
<p>
Shame and fear may beset men here, and bid thanksgiving and pride be dumb:<br/>
Faith, discrowned of her praise, and wound about with toils till her life wax numb,<br/>
Scarce may see if the sundawn be, if darkness die not and dayrise come.
</p>
<p>
But England, enmeshed and benetted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With spiritless villainies round,<br/>
With counsels of cowardice fretted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With trammels of treason enwound,<br/>
Is yet, though the season be other<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than wept and rejoiced over thee,<br/>
Thine England, thy lover, thy mother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublime as the sea.
</p>
<p>
Hers wast thou: if her face be now less bright, or seem for an hour less brave,<br/>
Let but thine on her darkness shine, thy saviour spirit revive and save,<br/>
Time shall see, as the shadows flee, her shame entombed in a shameful grave.
</p>
<p>
If death and not life were the portal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That opens on life at the last,<br/>
If the spirit of Sidney were mortal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the past of it utterly past,<br/>
Fear stronger than honour was ever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgetfulness mightier than fame,<br/>
Faith knows not if England should never<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subside into shame.
</p>
<p>
Yea, but yet is thy sun not set, thy sunbright spirit of trust withdrawn:<br/>
England's love of thee burns above all hopes that darken or fears that fawn:<br/>
Hers thou art: and the faithful heart that hopes begets upon darkness dawn.
</p>
<p>
The sunset that sunrise will follow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is less than the dream of a dream:<br/>
The starshine on height and on hollow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheds promise that dawn shall redeem:<br/>
The night, if the daytime would hide it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shows lovelier, aflame and afar,<br/>
Thy soul and thy Stella's beside it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A star by a star.

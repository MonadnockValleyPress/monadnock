  &mdash;Sappho.

<p>
My life is bitter with thy love; thine eyes<br/>
Blind me, thy tresses burn me, thy sharp sighs<br/>
Divide my flesh and spirit with soft sound,<br/>
And my blood strengthens, and my veins abound.<br/>
I pray thee sigh not, speak not, draw not breath;<br/>
Let life burn down, and dream it is not death.<br/>
I would the sea had hidden us, the fire<br/>
(Wilt thou fear that, and fear not my desire?)<br/>
Severed the bones that bleach, the flesh that cleaves,<br/>
And let our sifted ashes drop like leaves.<br/>
I feel thy blood against my blood: my pain<br/>
Pains thee, and lips bruise lips, and vein stings vein.<br/>
Let fruit be crushed on fruit, let flower on flower,<br/>
Breast kindle breast, and either burn one hour.<br/>
Why wilt thou follow lesser loves? are thine<br/>
Too weak to bear these hands and lips of mine?<br/>
I charge thee for my life's sake, O too sweet<br/>
To crush love with thy cruel faultless feet,<br/>
I charge thee keep thy lips from hers or his,<br/>
Sweetest, till theirs be sweeter than my kiss.<br/>
Lest I too lure, a swallow for a dove,<br/>
Erotion or Erinna to my love.<br/>
I would my love could kill thee; I am satiated<br/>
With seeing thee live, and fain would have thee dead.<br/>
I would earth had thy body as fruit to eat,<br/>
And no mouth but some serpent's found thee sweet.<br/>
I would find grievous ways to have thee slain,<br/>
Intense device, and superflux of pain;<br/>
Vex thee with amorous agonies, and shake<br/>
Life at thy lips, and leave it there to ache;<br/>
Strain out thy soul with pangs too soft to kill,<br/>
Intolerable interludes, and infinite ill;<br/>
Relapse and reluctation of the breath,<br/>
Dumb tunes and shuddering semitones of death.<br/>
I am weary of all thy words and soft strange ways,<br/>
Of all love's fiery nights and all his days,<br/>
And all the broken kisses salt as brine<br/>
That shuddering lips make moist with waterish wine,<br/>
And eyes the bluer for all those hidden hours<br/>
That pleasure fills with tears and feeds from flowers,<br/>
Fierce at the heart with fire that half comes through,<br/>
But all the flowerlike white stained round with blue;<br/>
The fervent underlid, and that above<br/>
Lifted with laughter or abashed with love;<br/>
Thine amorous girdle, full of thee and fair,<br/>
And leavings of the lilies in thine hair.<br/>
Yea, all sweet words of thine and all thy ways,<br/>
And all the fruit of nights and flower of days,<br/>
And stinging lips wherein the hot sweet brine<br/>
That Love was born of burns and foams like wine,<br/>
And eyes insatiable of amorous hours,<br/>
Fervent as fire and delicate as flowers,<br/>
Coloured like night at heart, but cloven through<br/>
Like night with flame, dyed round like night with blue,<br/>
Clothed with deep eyelids under and above&mdash;<br/>
Yea, all thy beauty sickens me with love;<br/>
Thy girdle empty of thee and now not fair,<br/>
And ruinous lilies in thy languid hair.<br/>
Ah, take no thought for Love's sake; shall this be,<br/>
And she who loves thy lover not love thee?<br/>
Sweet soul, sweet mouth of all that laughs and lives,<br/>
Mine is she, very mine; and she forgives.<br/>
For I beheld in sleep the light that is<br/>
In her high place in Paphos, heard the kiss<br/>
Of body and soul that mix with eager tears<br/>
And laughter stinging through the eyes and ears;<br/>
Saw Love, as burning flame from crown to feet,<br/>
Imperishable, upon her storied seat;<br/>
Clear eyelids lifted toward the north and south,<br/>
A mind of many colours, and a mouth<br/>
Of many tunes and kisses; and she bowed,<br/>
With all her subtle face laughing aloud,<br/>
Bowed down upon me, saying, "Who doth thee wrong,<br/>
Sappho?" but thou&mdash;thy body is the song,<br/>
Thy mouth the music; thou art more than I,<br/>
Though my voice die not till the whole world die;<br/>
Though men that hear it madden; though love weep,<br/>
Though nature change, though shame be charmed to sleep.<br/>
Ah, wilt thou slay me lest I kiss thee dead?<br/>
Yet the queen laughed from her sweet heart and said:<br/>
"Even she that flies shall follow for thy sake,<br/>
And she shall give thee gifts that would not take,<br/>
Shall kiss that would not kiss thee" (yea, kiss me)<br/>
"When thou wouldst not"&mdash;when I would not kiss thee!<br/>
Ah, more to me than all men as thou art,<br/>
Shall not my songs assuage her at the heart?<br/>
Ah, sweet to me as life seems sweet to death,<br/>
Why should her wrath fill thee with fearful breath?<br/>
Nay, sweet, for is she God alone? hath she<br/>
Made earth and all the centuries of the sea,<br/>
Taught the sun ways to travel, woven most fine<br/>
The moonbeams, shed the starbeams forth as wine,<br/>
Bound with her myrtles, beaten with her rods,<br/>
The young men and the maidens and the gods?<br/>
Have we not lips to love with, eyes for tears,<br/>
And summer and flower of women and of years?<br/>
Stars for the foot of morning, and for noon<br/>
Sunlight, and exaltation of the moon;<br/>
Waters that answer waters, fields that wear<br/>
Lilies, and languor of the Lesbian air?<br/>
Beyond those flying feet of fluttered doves,<br/>
Are there not other gods for other loves?<br/>
Yea, though she scourge thee, sweetest, for my sake,<br/>
Blossom not thorns and flowers not blood should break.<br/>
Ah that my lips were tuneless lips, but pressed<br/>
To the bruised blossom of thy scourged white breast!<br/>
Ah that my mouth for Muses' milk were fed<br/>
On the sweet blood thy sweet small wounds had bled!<br/>
That with my tongue I felt them, and could taste<br/>
The faint flakes from thy bosom to the waist!<br/>
That I could drink thy veins as wine, and eat<br/>
Thy breasts like honey! that from face to feet<br/>
Thy body were abolished and consumed,<br/>
And in my flesh thy very flesh entombed!<br/>
Ah, ah, thy beauty! like a beast it bites,<br/>
Stings like an adder, like an arrow smites.<br/>
Ah sweet, and sweet again, and seven times sweet,<br/>
The paces and the pauses of thy feet!<br/>
Ah sweeter than all sleep or summer air<br/>
The fallen fillets fragrant from thine hair!<br/>
Yea, though their alien kisses do me wrong,<br/>
Sweeter thy lips than mine with all their song;<br/>
Thy shoulders whiter than a fleece of white,<br/>
And flower-sweet fingers, good to bruise or bite<br/>
As honeycomb of the inmost honey-cells,<br/>
With almond-shaped and roseleaf-coloured shells<br/>
And blood like purple blossom at the tips<br/>
Quivering; and pain made perfect in thy lips<br/>
For my sake when I hurt thee; O that I<br/>
Durst crush thee out of life with love, and die,<br/>
Die of thy pain and my delight, and be<br/>
Mixed with thy blood and molten into thee!<br/>
Would I not plague thee dying overmuch?<br/>
Would I not hurt thee perfectly? not touch<br/>
Thy pores of sense with torture, and make bright<br/>
Thine eyes with bloodlike tears and grievous light?<br/>
Strike pang from pang as note is struck from note,<br/>
Catch the sob's middle music in thy throat,<br/>
Take thy limbs living, and new-mould with these<br/>
A lyre of many faultless agonies?<br/>
Feed thee with fever and famine and fine drouth,<br/>
With perfect pangs convulse thy perfect mouth,<br/>
Make thy life shudder in thee and burn afresh,<br/>
And wring thy very spirit through the flesh?<br/>
Cruel? but love makes all that love him well<br/>
As wise as heaven and crueller than hell.<br/>
Me hath love made more bitter toward thee<br/>
Than death toward man; but were I made as he<br/>
Who hath made all things to break them one by one,<br/>
If my feet trod upon the stars and sun<br/>
And souls of men as his have alway trod,<br/>
God knows I might be crueller than God.<br/>
For who shall change with prayers or thanksgivings<br/>
The mystery of the cruelty of things?<br/>
Or say what God above all gods and years<br/>
With offering and blood-sacrifice of tears,<br/>
With lamentation from strange lands, from graves<br/>
Where the snake pastures, from scarred mouths of slaves,<br/>
From prison, and from plunging prows of ships<br/>
Through flamelike foam of the sea's closing lips&mdash;<br/>
With thwartings of strange signs, and wind-blown hair<br/>
Of comets, desolating the dim air,<br/>
When darkness is made fast with seals and bars,<br/>
And fierce reluctance of disastrous stars,<br/>
Eclipse, and sound of shaken hills, and wings<br/>
Darkening, and blind inexpiable things&mdash;<br/>
With sorrow of labouring moons, and altering light<br/>
And travail of the planets of the night,<br/>
And weeping of the weary Pleiads seven,<br/>
Feeds the mute melancholy lust of heaven?<br/>
Is not his incense bitterness, his meat<br/>
Murder? his hidden face and iron feet<br/>
Hath not man known, and felt them on their way<br/>
Threaten and trample all things and every day?<br/>
Hath he not sent us hunger? who hath cursed<br/>
Spirit and flesh with longing? filled with thirst<br/>
Their lips who cried unto him? who bade exceed<br/>
The fervid will, fall short the feeble deed,<br/>
Bade sink the spirit and the flesh aspire,<br/>
Pain animate the dust of dead desire,<br/>
And life yield up her flower to violent fate?<br/>
Him would I reach, him smite, him desecrate,<br/>
Pierce the cold lips of God with human breath,<br/>
And mix his immortality with death.<br/>
Why hath he made us? what had all we done<br/>
That we should live and loathe the sterile sun,<br/>
And with the moon wax paler as she wanes,<br/>
And pulse by pulse feel time grow through our veins?<br/>
Thee too the years shall cover; thou shalt be<br/>
As the rose born of one same blood with thee,<br/>
As a song sung, as a word said, and fall<br/>
Flower-wise, and be not any more at all,<br/>
Nor any memory of thee anywhere;<br/>
For never Muse has bound above thine hair<br/>
The high Pierian flower whose graft outgrows<br/>
All summer kinship of the mortal rose<br/>
And colour of deciduous days, nor shed<br/>
Reflex and flush of heaven about thine head,<br/>
Nor reddened brows made pale by floral grief<br/>
With splendid shadow from that lordlier leaf.<br/>
Yea, thou shalt be forgotten like spilt wine,<br/>
Except these kisses of my lips on thine<br/>
Brand them with immortality; but me&mdash;<br/>
Men shall not see bright fire nor hear the sea,<br/>
Nor mix their hearts with music, nor behold<br/>
Cast forth of heaven, with feet of awful gold<br/>
And plumeless wings that make the bright air blind,<br/>
Lightning, with thunder for a hound behind<br/>
Hunting through fields unfurrowed and unsown,<br/>
But in the light and laughter, in the moan<br/>
And music, and in grasp of lip and hand<br/>
And shudder of water that makes felt on land<br/>
The immeasurable tremor of all the sea,<br/>
Memories shall mix and metaphors of me.<br/>
Like me shall be the shuddering calm of night,<br/>
When all the winds of the world for pure delight<br/>
Close lips that quiver and fold up wings that ache;<br/>
When nightingales are louder for love's sake,<br/>
And leaves tremble like lute-strings or like fire;<br/>
Like me the one star swooning with desire<br/>
Even at the cold lips of the sleepless moon,<br/>
As I at thine; like me the waste white noon,<br/>
Burnt through with barren sunlight; and like me<br/>
The land-stream and the tide-stream in the sea.<br/>
I am sick with time as these with ebb and flow,<br/>
And by the yearning in my veins I know<br/>
The yearning sound of waters; and mine eyes<br/>
Burn as that beamless fire which fills the skies<br/>
With troubled stars and travailing things of flame;<br/>
And in my heart the grief consuming them<br/>
Labours, and in my veins the thirst of these,<br/>
And all the summer travail of the trees<br/>
And all the winter sickness; and the earth,<br/>
Filled full with deadly works of death and birth,<br/>
Sore spent with hungry lusts of birth and death,<br/>
Has pain like mine in her divided breath;<br/>
Her spring of leaves is barren, and her fruit<br/>
Ashes; her boughs are burdened, and her root<br/>
Fibrous and gnarled with poison; underneath<br/>
Serpents have gnawn it through with tortuous teeth<br/>
Made sharp upon the bones of all the dead,<br/>
And wild birds rend her branches overhead.<br/>
These, woven as raiment for his word and thought,<br/>
These hath God made, and me as these, and wrought<br/>
Song, and hath lit it at my lips; and me<br/>
Earth shall not gather though she feed on thee.<br/>
As a shed tear shalt thou be shed; but I&mdash;<br/>
Lo, earth may labour, men live long and die,<br/>
Years change and stars, and the high God devise<br/>
New things, and old things wane before his eyes<br/>
Who wields and wrecks them, being more strong than they&mdash;<br/>
But, having made me, me he shall not slay.<br/>
Nor slay nor satiate, like those herds of his<br/>
Who laugh and live a little, and their kiss<br/>
Contents them, and their loves are swift and sweet,<br/>
And sure death grasps and gains them with slow feet,<br/>
Love they or hate they, strive or bow their knees&mdash;<br/>
And all these end; he hath his will of these.<br/>
Yea, but albeit he slay me, hating me&mdash;<br/>
Albeit he hide me in the deep dear sea<br/>
And cover me with cool wan foam, and ease<br/>
This soul of mine as any soul of these,<br/>
And give me water and great sweet waves, and make<br/>
The very sea's name lordlier for my sake,<br/>
The whole sea sweeter&mdash;albeit I die indeed<br/>
And hide myself and sleep and no man heed,<br/>
Of me the high God hath not all his will.<br/>
Blossom of branches, and on each high hill<br/>
Clear air and wind, and under in clamorous vales<br/>
Fierce noises of the fiery nightingales,<br/>
Buds burning in the sudden spring like fire,<br/>
The wan washed sand and the waves' vain desire,<br/>
Sails seen like blown white flowers at sea, and words<br/>
That bring tears swiftest, and long notes of birds<br/>
Violently singing till the whole world sings&mdash;<br/>
I Sappho shall be one with all these things,<br/>
With all high things for ever; and my face<br/>
Seen once, my songs once heard in a strange place,<br/>
Cleave to men's lives, and waste the days thereof<br/>
With gladness and much sadness and long love.<br/>
Yea, they shall say, earth's womb has borne in vain<br/>
New things, and never this best thing again;<br/>
Borne days and men, borne fruits and wars and wine,<br/>
Seasons and songs, but no song more like mine.<br/>
And they shall know me as ye who have known me here,<br/>
Last year when I loved Atthis, and this year<br/>
When I love thee; and they shall praise me, and say<br/>
"She hath all time as all we have our day,<br/>
Shall she not live and have her will"&mdash;even I?<br/>
Yea, though thou diest, I say I shall not die.<br/>
For these shall give me of their souls, shall give<br/>
Life, and the days and loves wherewith I live,<br/>
Shall quicken me with loving, fill with breath,<br/>
Save me and serve me, strive for me with death.<br/>
Alas, that neither moon nor snow nor dew<br/>
Nor all cold things can purge me wholly through,<br/>
Assuage me nor allay me nor appease,<br/>
Till supreme sleep shall bring me bloodless ease;<br/>
Till time wax faint in all his periods;<br/>
Till fate undo the bondage of the gods,<br/>
And lay, to slake and satiate me all through,<br/>
Lotus and Lethe on my lips like dew,<br/>
And shed around and over and under me<br/>
Thick darkness and the insuperable sea.

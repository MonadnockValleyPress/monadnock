<h1>A Lamentation</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
Who hath known the ways of time<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or trodden behind his feet?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such man among men.<br/>
For chance overcomes him, or crime<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes; for all things sweet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In time wax bitter again.<br/>
Who shall give sorrow enough,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or who the abundance of tears?<br/>
Mine eyes are heavy with love<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a sword gone thorough mine ears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sound like a sword and fire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For pity, for great desire;<br/>
Who shall ensure me thereof,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest I die, being full of my fears?
</p>
<p>
Who hath known the ways and the wrath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleepless spirit, the root<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blossom of evil will,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The divine device of a god?<br/>
Who shall behold it or hath?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twice-tongued prophets are mute,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The many speakers are still;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No foot has travelled or trod,<br/>
No hand has meted, his path.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man's fate is a blood-red fruit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mighty gods have their fill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And relax not the rein, or the rod.
</p>
<p>
Ye were mighty in heart from of old,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye slew with the spear, and are slain.<br/>
Keen after heat is the cold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sore after summer is rain,<br/>
And melteth man to the bone.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As water he weareth away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a flower, as an hour in a day,<br/>
Fallen from laughter to moan.<br/>
But my spirit is shaken with fear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest an evil thing begin,<br/>
New-born, a spear for a spear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one for another sin.<br/>
Or ever our tears began,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was known from of old and said;<br/>
One law for a living man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another law for the dead.<br/>
For these are fearful and sad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vain, and things without breath;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he lives let a man be glad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For none hath joy of his death.
</p>

<p>
Who hath known the pain, the old pain of earth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or all the travail of the sea,<br/>
The many ways and waves, the birth<br/>
Fruitless, the labour nothing worth?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hath known, who knoweth, O gods? not we.<br/>
There is none shall say he hath seen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is none he hath known.<br/>
Though he saith, Lo, a lord have I been,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have reaped and sown;<br/>
I have seen the desire of mine eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning of love,<br/>
The season of kisses and sighs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the end thereof.<br/>
I have known the ways of the sea,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the perilous ways,<br/>
Strange winds have spoken with me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tongues of strange days.<br/>
I have hewn the pine for ships;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where steeds run arow,<br/>
I have seen from their bridled lips<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foam blown as the snow.<br/>
With snapping of chariot-poles<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with straining of oars<br/>
I have grazed in the race the goals,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the storm the shores;<br/>
As a greave is cleft with an arrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the joint of the knee,<br/>
I have cleft through the sea-straits narrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the heart of the sea.<br/>
When air was smitten in sunder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have watched on high<br/>
The ways of the stars and the thunder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night of the sky;<br/>
Where the dark brings forth light as a flower,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from lips that dissever;<br/>
One abideth the space of an hour,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One endureth for ever.<br/>
Lo, what hath he seen or known,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the way and the wave<br/>
Unbeholden, unsailed on, unsown,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the breast to the grave?
</p>
<p>
Or ever the stars were made, or skies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grief was born, and the kinless night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother of gods without form or name.<br/>
And light is born out of heaven and dies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one day knows not another's light,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But night is one, and her shape the same.
</p>
<p>
But dumb the goddesses underground<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, and we hear not on earth if their feet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise, and the night wax loud with their wings;<br/>
Dumb, without word or shadow of sound;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sift in scales and winnow as wheat<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men's souls, and sorrow of manifold things.
</p>

<p>
Nor less of grief than ours<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods wrought long ago<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bruise men one by one;<br/>
But with the incessant hours<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh grief and greener woe<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring, as the sudden sun<br/>
Year after year makes flowers;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these die down and grow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the next year lacks none.
</p>
<p>
As these men sleep, have slept<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old heroes in time fled,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No dream-divided sleep;<br/>
And holier eyes have wept<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than ours, when on her dead<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gods have seen Thetis weep,<br/>
With heavenly hair far-swept<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back, heavenly hands outspread<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round what she could not keep,
</p>
<p>
Could not one day withhold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night; and like as these<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White ashes of no weight,<br/>
Held not his urn the cold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ashes of Heracles?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all things born one gate<br/>
Opens, no gate of gold;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opens; and no man sees<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the gods and fate.

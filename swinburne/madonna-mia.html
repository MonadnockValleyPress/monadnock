<h1>Madonna Mia</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
Under green apple-boughs<br/>
That never a storm will rouse,<br/>
My lady hath her house<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between two bowers;<br/>
In either of the twain<br/>
Red roses full of rain;<br/>
She hath for bondwomen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kind of flowers.
</p>
<p>
She hath no handmaid fair<br/>
To draw her curled gold hair<br/>
Through rings of gold that bear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her whole hair's weight;<br/>
She hath no maids to stand<br/>
Gold-clothed on either hand;<br/>
In all the great green land<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None is so great.
</p>
<p>
She hath no more to wear<br/>
But one white hood of vair<br/>
Drawn over eyes and hair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrought with strange gold,<br/>
Made for some great queen's head,<br/>
Some fair great queen since dead;<br/>
And one strait gown of red<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the cold.
</p>
<p>
Beneath her eyelids deep<br/>
Love lying seems asleep,<br/>
Love, swift to wake, to weep,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To laugh, to gaze;<br/>
Her breasts are like white birds,<br/>
And all her gracious words<br/>
As water-grass to herds<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the June-days.
</p>
<p>
To her all dews that fall<br/>
And rains are musical;<br/>
Her flowers are fed from all,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her joy from these;<br/>
In the deep-feathered firs<br/>
Their gift of joy is hers,<br/>
In the least breath that stirs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the trees.
</p>
<p>
She grows with greenest leaves,<br/>
Ripens with reddest sheaves,<br/>
Forgets, remembers, grieves,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is not sad;<br/>
The quiet lands and skies<br/>
Leave light upon her eyes;<br/>
None knows her, weak or wise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or tired or glad.
</p>
<p>
None knows, none understands,<br/>
What flowers are like her hands;<br/>
Though you should search all lands<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein time grows,<br/>
What snows are like her feet,<br/>
Though his eyes burn with heat<br/>
Through gazing on my sweet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet no man knows.
</p>
<p>
Only this thing is said;<br/>
That white and gold and red,<br/>
God's three chief words, man's bread<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oil and wine,<br/>
Were given her for dowers,<br/>
And kingdom of all hours,<br/>
And grace of goodly flowers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And various vine.
</p>
<p>
This is my lady's praise:<br/>
God after many days<br/>
Wrought her in unknown ways,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sunset lands;<br/>
This was my lady's birth;<br/>
God gave her might and mirth<br/>
And laid his whole sweet earth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between her hands.
</p>
<p>
Under deep apple-boughs<br/>
My lady hath her house;<br/>
She wears upon her brows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flower thereof;<br/>
All saying but what God saith<br/>
To her is as vain breath;<br/>
She is more strong than death,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being strong as love.<br/>

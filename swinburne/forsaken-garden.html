<h1>A Forsaken Garden</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
In a coign of the cliff between lowland and highland,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the sea-down's edge between windward and lee,<br/>
Walled round with rocks as an inland island,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost of a garden fronts the sea.<br/>
A girdle of brushwood and thorn encloses<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steep square slope of the blossomless bed<br/>
Where the weeds that grew green from the graves of its roses<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now lie dead.
<p>
</p>
The fields fall southward, abrupt and broken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the low last edge of the long lone land.<br/>
If a step should sound or a word be spoken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would a ghost not rise at the strange guest's hand?<br/>
So long have the grey bare walks lain guestless,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through branches and briars if a man make way,<br/>
He shall find no life but the sea-wind's, restless<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night and day.
</p>
<p>
The dense hard passage is blind and stifled<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That crawls by a track none turn to climb<br/>
To the strait waste place that the years have rifled<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all but the thorns that are touched not of time.<br/>
The thorns he spares when the rose is taken;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rocks are left when he wastes the plain.<br/>
The wind that wanders, the weeds wind-shaken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These remain.
</p>
<p>
Not a flower to be pressed of the foot that falls not;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the heart of a dead man the seed-plots are dry;<br/>
From the thicket of thorns whence the nightingale calls not,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could she call, there were never a rose to reply.<br/>
Over the meadows that blossom and wither<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rings but the note of a sea-bird's song;<br/>
Only the sun and the rain come hither<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All year long.
</p>
<p>
The sun burns sere and the rain dishevels<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One gaunt bleak blossom of scentless breath.<br/>
Only the wind here hovers and revels<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a round where life seems barren as death.<br/>
Here there was laughing of old, there was weeping,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haply, of lovers none ever will know,<br/>
Whose eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years ago.
</p>
<p>
Heart handfast in heart as they stood, "Look thither,"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he whisper? "look forth from the flowers to the sea;<br/>
For the foam-flowers endure when the rose-blossoms wither,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And men that love lightly may die &mdash; but we?"<br/>
And the same wind sang and the same waves whitened,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And or ever the garden's last petals were shed,<br/>
In the lips that had whispered, the eyes that had lightened,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love was dead.
</p>
<p>
Or they loved their life through, and then went whither?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And were one to the end &mdash; but what end who knows?<br/>
Love deep as the sea as a rose must wither,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the rose-red seaweed that mocks the rose.<br/>
Shall the dead take thought for the dead to love them?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What love was ever as deep as a grave?<br/>
They are loveless now as the grass above them<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the wave.
</p>
<p>
All are at one now, roses and lovers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not known of the cliffs and the fields and the sea.<br/>
Not a breath of the time that has been hovers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the air now soft with a summer to be.<br/>
Not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons hereafter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or weep,<br/>
When as they that are free now of weeping and laughter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall sleep.
</p>
<p>
Here death may deal not again for ever;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here change may come not till all change end.<br/>
From the graves they have made they shall rise up never,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have left nought living to ravage and rend.<br/>
Earth, stones, and thorns of the wild ground growing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the sun and the rain live, these shall be;<br/>
Till a last wind's breath upon all these blowing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll the sea.
</p>
<p>
Till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff crumble,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till terrace and meadow the deep gulfs drink,<br/>
Till the strength of the waves of the high tides humble<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fields that lessen, the rocks that shrink,<br/>
Here now in his triumph where all things falter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread,<br/>
As a god self-slain on his own strange altar,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death lies dead.

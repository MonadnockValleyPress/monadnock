<h1>A Ballad of Appeal</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>To Christina G. Rossetti</h3>
<p>
Song wakes with every wakening year<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From hearts of birds that only feel<br/>
Brief spring's deciduous flower-time near:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And song more strong to help or heal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall silence worse than winter seal?<br/>
From love-lit thought's remurmuring cave<br/>
The notes that rippled, wave on wave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were clear as love, as faith were strong;<br/>
And all souls blessed the soul that gave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet water from the well of song.
</p>
<p>
All hearts bore fruit of joy to hear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All eyes felt mist upon them steal<br/>
For joy's sake, trembling toward a tear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When, loud as marriage-bells that peal,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or flutelike soft, or keen like steel,<br/>
Sprang the sheer music; sharp or grave,<br/>
We heard the drift of winds that drave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw, swept round by ghosts in throng,<br/>
Dark rocks, that yielded, where they clave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet water from the well of song.
</p>
<p>
Blithe verse made all the dim sense clear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That smiles of babbling babes conceal:<br/>
Prayer's perfect heart spake here: and here<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose notes of blameless woe and weal,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More soft than this poor song's appeal.<br/>
Where orchards bask, where cornfields wave,<br/>
They dropped like rains that cleanse and lave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And scattered all the year along,<br/>
Like dewfall on an April grave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet water from the well of song.
</p>
<p>
Ballad, go bear our prayer, and crave<br/>
Pardon, because thy lowlier stave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can do this plea no right, but wrong.<br/>
Ask nought beside thy pardon, save<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet water from the well of song.

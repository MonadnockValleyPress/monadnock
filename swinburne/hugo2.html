<h1>To Victor Hugo</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
He had no children, who for love of men,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being God, endured of Gods such things as thou,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Father; nor on his thunderâ€‘beaten brow<br/>
Fell such a woe as bows thine head again,<br/>
Twice bowed before, though godlike, in man's ken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And seen too high for any stroke to bow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save this of some strange God's that bends it now<br/>
The third time with such weight as bruised it then.<br/>
Fain would grief speak, fain utter for love's sake<br/>
Some word; but comfort who might bid thee take?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What God in your own tongue shall talk with thee,<br/>
Showing how all souls that look upon the sun<br/>
Shall be for thee one spirit and thy son,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thy soul's child the soul of man to be?
</p>

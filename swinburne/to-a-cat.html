<h1>To a Cat</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
Stately, kindly, lordly friend,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Condescend<br/>
Here to sit by me, and turn<br/>
Glorious eyes that smile and burn,<br/>
Golden eyes, love's lustrous meed,<br/>
On the golden page I read.
</p>
<p>
All your wondrous wealth of hair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark and fair,<br/>
Silken-shaggy, soft and bright<br/>
As the clouds and beams of night,<br/>
Pays my reverent hand's caress<br/>
Back with friendlier gentleness.
</p>
<p>
Dogs may fawn on all and some<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they come;<br/>
You, a friend of loftier mind,<br/>
Answer friends alone in kind.<br/>
Just your foot upon my hand<br/>
Softly bids it understand.
</p>
<p>
Morning round this silent sweet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garden-seat<br/>
Sheds its wealth of gathering light,<br/>
Thrills the gradual clouds with might,<br/>
Changes woodland, orchard, heath,<br/>
Lawn, and garden there beneath.
</p>
<p>
Fair and dim they gleamed below:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they glow<br/>
Deep as even your sunbright eyes,<br/>
Fair as even the wakening skies.<br/>
Can it not or can it be<br/>
Now that you give thanks to see?
</p>
<p>
May not you rejoice as I,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the sky<br/>
Change to heaven revealed, and bid<br/>
Earth reveal the heaven it hid<br/>
All night long from stars and moon,<br/>
Now the sun sets all in tune?
</p>
<p>
What within you wakes with day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can say?<br/>
All too little may we tell,<br/>
Friends who like each other well,<br/>
What might haply, if we might,<br/>
Bid us read our lives aright.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
Wild on woodland ways your sires<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashed like fires;<br/>
Fair as flame and fierce and fleet<br/>
As with wings on wingless feet<br/>
Shone and sprang your mother, free,<br/>
Bright and brave as wind or sea.
</p>
<p>
Free and proud and glad as they,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here to-day<br/>
Rests or roams their radiant child,<br/>
Vanquished not, but reconciled,<br/>
Free from curb of aught above<br/>
Save the lovely curb of love.
</p>
<p>
Love through dreams of souls divine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fain would shine<br/>
Round a dawn whose light and song<br/>
Then should right our mutual wrong&mdash;<br/>
Speak, and seal the love-lit law<br/>
Sweet Assisi's seer foresaw.
</p>
<p>
Dreams were theirs; yet haply may<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn a day<br/>
When such friends and fellows born,<br/>
Seeing our earth as fair at morn,<br/>
May for wiser love's sake see<br/>
More of heaven's deep heart than we.

<h1>A New-Year Ode</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>To Victor Hugo</h3>
<h4>I.</h4>
<p>
Twice twelve times have the springs of years refilled<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their fountains from the river-head of time<br/>
Since by the green sea's marge, ere autumn chilled<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Waters and woods with sense of changing clime,<br/>
A great light rose upon my soul, and thrilled<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My spirit of sense with sense of spheres in chime,<br/>
Sound as of song wherewith a God would build<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Towers that no force of conquering war might climb.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind shook the glimmering sea<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as my soul in me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was stirred with breath of mastery more sublime,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uplift and borne along<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More thunderous tides of song,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where wave rang back to wave more rapturous rhyme<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And world on world flashed lordlier light<br/>
Than ever lit the wandering ways of ships by night.
</p>
<h4>II.</h4>
<p>
The spirit of God, whose breath of life is song,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved, though his word was human, on the face<br/>
Of those deep waters of the soul, too long<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dumb, dark, and cold, that waited for the grace<br/>
Wherewith day kindles heaven: and as some throng<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of quiring wings fills full some lone chill place<br/>
With sudden rush of life and joy, more strong<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than death or sorrow or all night's darkling race,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So was my heart, that heard<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All heaven in each deep word,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled full with light of thought, and waxed apace<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itself more wide and deep,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take that gift and keep<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And cherish while my days fulfilled their space;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A record wide as earth and sea,<br/>
The Legend writ of Ages past and yet to be.
</p>
<h4>III.</h4>
<p>
As high the chant of Paradise and Hell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose, when the soul of Milton gave it wings;<br/>
As wide the sweep of Shakespeare's empire fell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When life had bared for him her secret springs;<br/>
But not his various soul might range and dwell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the mysteries of the founts of things;<br/>
Nor Milton's range of rule so far might swell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the kingdoms of forgotten kings.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men, centuries, nations, time,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life, death, love, trust, and crime,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang record through the change of smitten strings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That felt an exile's hand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound hope for every land<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More loud than storm's cloud-sundering trumpet rings,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bid strong death for judgment rise,<br/>
And life bow down for judgment of his awless eyes.
</p>
<h4>IV.</h4>
<p>
And death, soul-stricken in his strength, resigned<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The keeping of the sepulchres to song;<br/>
And life was humbled, and his height of mind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought lower than lies a grave-stone fallen along;<br/>
And like a ghost and like a God mankind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose clad with light and darkness; weak and strong,<br/>
Clean and unclean, with eyes afire and blind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wounded and whole, fast bound with cord and thong,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free; fair and foul, sin-stained,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sinless; crowned and chained;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fleet-limbed, and halting all his lifetime long;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glad of deep shame, and sad<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For shame's sake; wise, and mad;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Girt round with love and hate of right and wrong;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armed and disarmed for sleep and strife;<br/>
Proud, and sore fear made havoc of his pride of life.
</p>
<h4>V.</h4>
<p>
Shadows and shapes of fable and storied sooth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose glorious as with gleam of gold unpriced;<br/>
Eve, clothed with heavenly nakedness and youth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That matched the morning's; Cain, self-sacrificed<br/>
On crime's first altar: legends wise as truth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And truth in legends deep embalmed and spiced;<br/>
The stars that saw the starlike eyes of Ruth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The grave that heard the clarion call of Christ.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And higher than sorrow and mirth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavenly song of earth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprang, in such notes as might have well sufficed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To still the storms of time<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sin's contentious clime<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With peace renewed of life reparadised:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth, scarred not yet with temporal scars;<br/>
Goddess of gods, our mother, chosen among the stars.
</p>
<h4>VI.</h4>
<p>
Earth fair as heaven, ere change and time set odds<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between them, light and darkness know not when,<br/>
And fear, grown strong through panic periods,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Crouched, a crowned worm, in faith's Lernean fen,<br/>
And love lay bound, and hope was scourged with rods,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And death cried out from desert and from den,<br/>
Seeing all the heaven above him dark with gods<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the world about him marred of men.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cities that nought might purge<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save the sea's whelming surge<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From all the pent pollutions in their pen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep death drank down, and wrought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wreck of all things, nought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That none might live of all their names again,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor aught of all whose life is breath<br/>
Serve any God whose likeness was not like to death.
</p>
<h4>VII.</h4>
<p>
Till by the lips and eyes of one live nation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The blind mute world found grace to see and speak,<br/>
And light watched rise a more divine creation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At that more godlike utterance of the Greek,<br/>
Let there be freedom. Kings whose orient station<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Made pale the morn, and all her presage bleak,<br/>
Girt each with strengths of all his generation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim tribes of shamefaced soul and sun-swart cheek,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice, urged with one desire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son following hard on sire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the wrath of all a world to wreak,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the rage of night<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afire against the light<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose weakness makes her strong-winged empire weak,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood up to unsay that saying, and fell<br/>
Too far for song, though song were thousand-tongued, to tell.
</p>
<h4>VIII.</h4>
<p>
From those deep echoes of the loud Ægean<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That rolled response whereat false fear was chid<br/>
By songs of joy sublime and Sophoclean,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh notes reverberate westward rose to bid<br/>
All wearier times take comfort from the pæan<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That tells the night what deeds the sunrise did,<br/>
Even till the lawns and torrents Pyrenean<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ring answer from the records of the Cid.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never force of fountains<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From sunniest hearts of mountains<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein the soul of hidden June was hid<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poured forth so pure and strong<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Springs of reiterate song,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud as the streams his fame was reared amid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More sweet than flowers they feed, and fair<br/>
With grace of lordlier sunshine and more lambent air.
</p>
<h4>IX.</h4>
<p>
A star more prosperous than the storm-clothed east's<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clothed all the warm south-west with light like spring's,<br/>
When hands of strong men spread the wolves their feasts<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And from snake-spirited princes plucked the stings;<br/>
Ere earth, grown all one den of hurtling beasts,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had for her sunshine and her watersprings<br/>
The fire of hell that warmed the hearts of priests,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wells of blood that slaked the lips of kings.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of night made stone<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood populous and alone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dense with its dead and loathed of living things<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That draw not life from death,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as with hell's own breath<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And clangour of immitigable wings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vexed the fair face of Paris, made<br/>
Foul in its murderous imminence of sound and shade.
</p>
<h4>X.</h4>
<p>
And all these things were parcels of the vision<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That moved a cloud before his eyes, or stood<br/>
A tower half shattered by the strong collision<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of spirit and spirit, of evil gods with good;<br/>
A ruinous wall rent through with grim division,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where time had marked his every monstrous mood<br/>
Of scorn and strength and pride and self-derision:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tower of Things, that felt upon it brood<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night, and about it cast<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm of all the past<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now mute and forceless as a fire subdued:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet through the rifted years<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And centuries veiled with tears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ages as with very death imbrued<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom, whence hope and faith grow strong,<br/>
Smiles, and firm love sustains the indissoluble song.
</p>
<h4>XI.</h4>
<p>
Above the cloudy coil of days deceased,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its might of flight, with mists and storms beset,<br/>
Burns heavenward, as with heart and hope increased,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the change of tempests, all the fret<br/>
Of frost or fire, keen fraud or force released,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherewith the world once wasted knows not yet<br/>
If evil or good lit all the darkling east<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ardent moon of sovereign Mahomet.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublime in work and will<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song sublimer still<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Salutes him, ere the splendour shrink and set;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with imperious eye<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wing that sounds the sky<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Soars and sees risen as ghosts in concourse met<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old world's seven elder wonders, firm<br/>
As dust and fixed as shadows, weaker than the worm.
</p>
<h4>XII.</h4>
<p>
High witness borne of knights high-souled and hoary<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before death's face and empire's rings and glows<br/>
Even from the dust their life poured forth left gory,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As the eagle's cry rings after from the snows<br/>
Supreme rebuke of shame clothed round with glory<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hosts whose track the false crowned eagle shows;<br/>
More loud than sounds through stormiest song and story<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The laugh of slayers whose names the sea-wind knows;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More loud than peals on land<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many a red wet hand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The clash of gold and cymbals as they close;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud as the blast that meets<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The might of marshalled fleets<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sheds it into shipwreck, like a rose<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blown from a child's light grasp in sign<br/>
That earth's high lords are lords not over breeze and brine.
</p>
<h4>XIII.</h4>
<p>
Above the dust and mire of man's dejection<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wide-winged spirit of song resurgent sees<br/>
His wingless and long-labouring resurrection<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the arduous heaven, by sore and strange degrees<br/>
Mount, and with splendour of the soul's reflection<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Strike heaven's dark sovereign down upon his knees,<br/>
Pale in the light of orient insurrection,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And dumb before the almightier lord's decrees<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who bade him be of yore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who bids him be no more:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all earth's heart is quickened as the sea's,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as when sunrise burns<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very sea's heart yearns<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That heard not on the midnight-walking breeze<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wail that woke with evensong<br/>
From hearts of poor folk watching all the darkness long.
</p>
<h4>XIV.</h4>
<p>
Dawn and the beams of sunbright song illume<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love, with strange children at her piteous breast,<br/>
By grace of weakness from the grave-mouthed gloom<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Plucked, and by mercy lulled to living rest,<br/>
Soft as the nursling's nigh the grandsire's tomb<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That fell on sleep, a bird of rifled nest;<br/>
Soft as the lips whose smile unsaid the doom<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That gave their sire to violent death's arrest.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for such love's sake strong,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrath fires the inveterate song<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That bids hell gape for one whose bland mouth blest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All slayers and liars that sighed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prayer as they slew and lied<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till blood had clothed his priesthood as a vest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hears, though darkness yet be dumb,<br/>
The silence of the trumpet of the wrath to come.
</p>
<h4>XV.</h4>
<p>
Nor lacked these lights of constellated age<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A star among them fed with life more dire,<br/>
Lit with his bloodied fame, whose withering rage<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Made earth for heaven's sake one funereal pyre<br/>
And life in faith's name one appointed stage<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For death to purge the souls of men with fire.<br/>
Heaven, earth, and hell on one thrice tragic page<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixed all their light and darkness: one man's lyre<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave all their echoes voice;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade rose-cheeked love rejoice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And cold-lipped craft with ravenous fear conspire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fire-eyed faith smite hope<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead, seeing enthroned as Pope<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And crowned of heaven on earth at hell's desire<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin, called by death's incestuous name<br/>
Borgia: the world that heard it flushed and quailed with shame.
</p>
<h4>XVI.</h4>
<p>
Another year, and hope triumphant heard<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The consummating sound of song that spake<br/>
Conclusion to the multitudinous word<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose expectation held her spirit awake<br/>
Till full delight for twice twelve years deferred<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade all souls entering eat and drink, and take<br/>
A third time comfort given them, that the third<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Might heap the measure up of twain, and make<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sinking year sublime<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among all sons of time<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fan in all men's memories for his sake.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each thought of ours became<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire, kindling from his flame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And music widening in his wide song's wake.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, and the world bore witness here<br/>
How great a light was risen upon this darkening year.
</p>
<h4>XVII.</h4>
<p>
It was the dawn of winter: sword in sheath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Change, veiled and mild, came down the gradual air<br/>
With cold slow smiles that hid the doom beneath.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Five days to die in yet were autumn's, ere<br/>
The last leaf withered from his flowerless wreath.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;South, east, and north, our skies were all blown bare,<br/>
But westward over glimmering holt and heath<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloud, wind, and light had made a heaven more fair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than ever dream or truth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showed earth in time's keen youth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When men with angels communed unaware.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the sun's head, now<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veiled even to the ardent brow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose two sheer wings of sundering cloud, that were<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a bird's poised for vehement flight,<br/>
Full-fledged with plumes of tawny fire and hoar grey light.
</p>
<h4>XVIII.</h4>
<p>
As midnight black, as twilight brown, they spread,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But feathered thick with flame that streaked and lined<br/>
Their living darkness, ominous else of dread,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From south to northmost verge of heaven inclined<br/>
Most like some giant angel's, whose bent head<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowed earthward, as with message for mankind<br/>
Of doom or benediction to be shed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From passage of his presence. Far behind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even while they seemed to close,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stoop, and take flight, arose<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Above them, higher than heavenliest thought may find<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light or night supreme<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of vision or of dream,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Immeasurable of men's eyes or mounting mind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven, manifest in manifold<br/>
Light of pure pallid amber, cheered with fire of gold.
</p>
<h4>XIX.</h4>
<p>
And where the fine gold faded all the sky<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone green as the outer sea when April glows,<br/>
Inlaid with flakes and feathers fledged to fly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cloud suspense in rapture and repose,<br/>
With large live petals, broad as love bids lie<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full open when the sun salutes the rose,<br/>
And small rent sprays wherewith the heavens most high<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were strewn as autumn strews the garden-close<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ruinous roseleaves whirled<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About their wan chill world,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through wind-worn bowers that now no music knows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spoil of the dim dusk year<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose utter night is near,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And near the flower of dawn beyond it blows;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till east and west were fire and light,<br/>
As though the dawn to come had flushed the coming night.
</p>
<h4>XX.</h4>
<p>
The highways paced of men that toil or play,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The byways known of none but lonely feet,<br/>
Were paven of purple woven of night and day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With hands that met as hands of friends might meet&mdash;<br/>
As though night's were not lifted up to slay<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And day's had waxed not weaker. Peace more sweet<br/>
Than music, light more soft than shadow, lay<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On downs and moorlands wan with day's defeat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That watched afar above<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life's very rose of love<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let all its lustrous leaves fall, fade, and fleet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fill all heaven and earth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full as with fires of birth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence time should feed his years with light and heat:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, not life's, but a flower more strong<br/>
Than life or time or death, love's very rose of song.
</p>
<h4>XXI.</h4>
<p>
Song visible, whence all men's eyes were lit<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With love and loving wonder: song that glowed<br/>
Through cloud and change on souls that knew not it<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hearts that wist not whence their comfort flowed,<br/>
Whence fear was lightened of her fever-fit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence anguish of her life-compelling load.<br/>
Yea, no man's head whereon the fire alit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all that passed along that sunset road<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westward, no brow so drear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No eye so dull of cheer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No face so mean whereon that light abode,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as with alien pride<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange godhead glorified<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each feature flushed from heaven with fire that showed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The likeness of its own life wrought<br/>
By strong transfiguration as of living thought.
</p>
<h4>XXII.</h4>
<p>
Nor only clouds of the everlasting sky,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor only men that paced that sunward way<br/>
To the utter bourne of evening, passed not by<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unblest or unillumined: none might say,<br/>
Of all things visible in the wide world's eye,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That all too low for all that grace it lay:<br/>
The lowliest lakelets of the moorland nigh,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The narrowest pools where shallowest wavelets play,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were filled from heaven above<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With light like fire of love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With flames and colours like a dawn in May,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hearts that lowlier live<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With light of thoughts that give<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Light from the depth of souls more deep than they<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through song's or story's kindling scroll,<br/>
The splendour of the shadow that reveals the soul.
</p>
<h4>XXIII.</h4>
<p>
For, when such light is in the world, we share,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us, all the rays thereof that shine:<br/>
Its presence is alive in the unseen air,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its fire within our veins as quickening wine;<br/>
A spirit is shed on all men everywhere,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Known or not known of all men for divine.<br/>
Yea, as the sun makes heaven, that light makes fair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All souls of ours, all lesser souls than thine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priest, prophet, seer and sage,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of a subject age<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That bears thy seal upon it for a sign;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose name shall be thy name,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose light thy light of fame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of love that makes thy soul a shrine;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose record through all years to be<br/>
Shall bear this witness written&mdash;that its womb bare thee.
</p>
<h4>XXIV.</h4>
<p>
O mystery, whence to one man's hand was given<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Power upon all things of the spirit, and might<br/>
Whereby the veil of all the years was riven<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And naked stood the secret soul of night!<br/>
O marvel, hailed of eyes whence cloud is driven,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That shows at last wrong reconciled with right<br/>
By death divine of evil and sin forgiven!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O light of song, whose fire is perfect light!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No speech, no voice, no thought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No love, avails us aught<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For service of thanksgiving in his sight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hath given us all for ever<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such gifts that man gave never<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So many and great since first Time's wings took flight.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man may not praise a spirit above<br/>
Man's: life and death shall praise him: we can only love.
</p>
<h4>XXV.</h4>
<p>
Life, everlasting while the worlds endure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Death, self-abased before a power more high,<br/>
Shall bear one witness, and their word stand sure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That not till time be dead shall this man die<br/>
Love, like a bird, comes loyal to his lure;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fame flies before him, wingless else to fly.<br/>
A child's heart toward his kind is not more pure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An eagle's toward the sun no lordlier eye.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awe sweet as love and proud<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As fame, though hushed and bowed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yearns toward him silent as his face goes by:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All crowns before his crown<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Triumphantly bow down,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For pride that one more great than all draws nigh:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All souls applaud, all hearts acclaim,<br/>
One heart benign, one soul supreme, one conquering name.

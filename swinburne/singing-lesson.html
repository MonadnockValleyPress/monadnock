<h1>A Singing Lesson</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
Far-fetched and dear-bought, as the proverb rehearses,<br/>
Is good, or was held so, for ladies: but nought<br/>
In a song can be good if the turn of the verse is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Far-fetched and dear-bought.
</p>
<p>
As the turn of a wave should it sound, and the thought<br/>
Ring smooth, and as light as the spray that disperses<br/>
Be the gleam of the words for the garb thereof wrought.
</p>
<p>
Let the soul in it shine through the sound as it pierces<br/>
Men's hearts with possession of music unsought;<br/>
For the bounties of song are no jealous god's mercies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Far-fetched and dear-bought.

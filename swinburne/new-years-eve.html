<h1>A New Year's Eve</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>Christina Rossetti died December 29, 1894</p>
<p>
The stars are strong in the deeps of the lustrous night,<br/>
Cold and splendid as death if his dawn be bright;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold as the cast-off garb that is cold as clay,<br/>
Splendid and strong as a spirit intense as light.
</p>
<p>
A soul more sweet than the morning of new-born May<br/>
Has passed with the year that has passed from the world away.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A song more sweet than the morning's first-born song<br/>
Again will hymn not among us a new year's day.
</p>
<p>
Not here, not here shall the carol of joy grown strong<br/>
Ring rapture now, and uplift us, a spell-struck throng,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From dream to vision of life that the soul may see<br/>
By death's grace only, if death do its trust no wrong.
</p>
<p>
Scarce yet the days and the starry nights are three<br/>
Since here among us a spirit abode as we,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Girt round with life that is fettered in bonds of time,<br/>
And clasped with darkness about as is earth with sea.
</p>
<p>
And now, more high than the vision of souls may climb,<br/>
The soul whose song was as music of stars that chime,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clothed round with life as of dawn and the mounting sun,<br/>
Sings, and we know not here of the song sublime.
</p>
<p>
No word is ours of it now that the songs are done<br/>
Whence here we drank of delight as in freedom won,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In deep deliverance given from the bonds we bore.<br/>
There is none to sing as she sang upon earth, not one.
</p>
<p>
We heard awhile: and for us who shall hear no more<br/>
The sound as of waves of light on a starry shore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Awhile bade brighten and yearn as a father's face<br/>
The face of death, divine as in days of yore.
</p>
<p>
The grey gloom quickened and quivered: the sunless place<br/>
Thrilled, and the silence deeper than time or space<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed now not all everlasting. Hope grew strong,<br/>
And love took comfort, given of the sweet song's grace.
</p>
<p>
Love that finds not on earth, where it finds but wrong,<br/>
Love that bears not the bondage of years in throng<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone to show for her, higher than the years that mar,<br/>
The life she looked and longed for as love must long.
</p>
<p>
Who knows? We know not. Afar, if the dead be far,<br/>
Alive, if the dead be alive as the soul's works are,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul whose breath was among us a heavenward song<br/>
Sings, loves, and shines as it shines for us here a star.

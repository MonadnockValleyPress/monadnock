<h1>A Ballad of François Villon</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>The Prince of All Ballad-Makers</h3>
<p>
Bird of the bitter bright grey golden morn<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce risen upon the dusk of dolorous years,<br/>
First of us all and sweetest singer born<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose far shrill note the world of new men hears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleave the cold shuddering shade as twilight clears;<br/>
When song new-born put off the old world's attire<br/>
And felt its tune on her changed lips expire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writ foremost on the roll of them that came<br/>
Fresh girt for service of the latter lyre,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name!
</p>
<p>
Alas the joy, the sorrow, and the scorn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That clothed thy life with hopes and sins and fears,<br/>
And gave thee stones for bread and tares for corn<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plume-plucked gaol-birds for thy starveling peers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till death clipt close their flight with shameful shears;<br/>
Till shifts came short and loves were hard to hire,<br/>
When lilt of song nor twitch of twangling wire<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could buy thee bread or kisses; when light fame<br/>
Spurned like a ball and haled through brake and briar,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name!
</p>
<p>
Poor splendid wings so frayed and soiled and torn!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor kind wild eyes so dashed with light quick tears!<br/>
Poor perfect voice, most blithe when most forlorn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That rings athwart the sea whence no man steers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like joy-bells crossed with death-bells in our ears!<br/>
What far delight has cooled the fierce desire<br/>
That like some ravenous bird was strong to tire<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that frail flesh and soul consumed with flame,<br/>
But left more sweet than roses to respire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name?
</p>
<h3>ENVOI</h3>
<p>
Prince of sweet songs made out of tears and fire,<br/>
A harlot was thy nurse, a God thy sire;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shame soiled thy song, and song assoiled thy shame.<br/>
But from thy feet now death has washed the mire,<br/>
Love reads out first at head of all our quire,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name.

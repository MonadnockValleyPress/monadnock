<h1>The Death of Richard Wagner</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>
Mourning on earth, as when dark hours descend,<br/>
Wide-winged with plagues, from heaven; when hope and mirth<br/>
Wane, and no lips rebuke or reprehend<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mourning on earth.
</p>
<p>
The soul wherein her songs of death and birth,<br/>
Darkness and light, were wont to sound and blend,<br/>
Now silent, leaves the whole world less in worth.
</p>
<p>
Winds that make moan and triumph, skies that bend,<br/>
Thunders, and sound of tides in gulf and firth,<br/>
Spake through his spirit of speech, whose death should send<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mourning on earth.
</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>
The world's great heart, whence all things strange and rare<br/>
Take form and sound, that each inseparate part<br/>
May bear its burden in all tuned thoughts that share<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The world's great heart&mdash;
</p>
<p>
The fountain forces, whence like steeds that start<br/>
Leap forth the powers of earth and fire and air,<br/>
Seas that revolve and rivers that depart&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Spake, and were turned to song: yea, all they were,<br/>
With all their works, found in his mastering art<br/>
Speech as of powers whose uttered word laid bare<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The world's great heart.
</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>
From the depths of the sea, from the wellsprings of earth, from the wastes of the midmost night,<br/>
From the fountains of darkness and tempest and thunder, from heights where the soul would be,<br/>
The spell of the mage of music evoked their sense, as an unknown light<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the depths of the sea.
</p>
<p>
As a vision of heaven from the hollows of ocean, that none but a god might see,<br/>
Rose out of the silence of things unknown of a presence, a form, a might,<br/>
And we heard as a prophet that hears God's message against him, and may not flee.
</p>
<p>
Eye might not endure it, but ear and heart with a rapture of dark delight,<br/>
With a terror and wonder whose core was joy, and a passion of thought set free,<br/>
Felt inly the rising of doom divine as a sundawn risen to sight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the depths of the sea.

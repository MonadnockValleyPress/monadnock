<h1>Prelude</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
Between the green bud and the red<br/>
Youth sat and sang by Time, and shed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From eyes and tresses flowers and tears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From heart and spirit hopes and fears,<br/>
Upon the hollow stream whose bed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is channelled by the foamless years;<br/>
And with the white the gold-haired head<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixed running locks, and in Time's ears<br/>
Youth's dreams hung singing, and Time's truth<br/>
Was half not harsh in the ears of Youth.
</p>
<p>
Between the bud and the blown flower<br/>
Youth talked with joy and grief an hour,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With footless joy and wingless grief<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And twin-born faith and disbelief<br/>
Who share the seasons to devour;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And long ere these made up their sheaf<br/>
Felt the winds round him shake and shower<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The rose-red and the blood-red leaf,<br/>
Delight whose germ grew never grain,<br/>
And passion dyed in its own pain.
</p>
<p>
Then he stood up, and trod to dust<br/>
Fear and desire, mistrust and trust,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And dreams of bitter sleep and sweet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bound for sandals on his feet<br/>
Knowledge and patience of what must<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And what things may be, in the heat<br/>
And cold of years that rot and rust<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And alter; and his spirit's meat<br/>
Was freedom, and his staff was wrought<br/>
Of strength, and his cloak woven of thought.
</p>
<p>
For what has he whose will sees clear<br/>
To do with doubt and faith and fear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift hopes and slow despondencies?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart is equal with the sea's<br/>
And with the sea-wind's, and his ear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is level to the speech of these,<br/>
And his soul communes and takes cheer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the actual earth's equalities,<br/>
Air, light, and night, hills, winds, and streams,<br/>
And seeks not strength from strengthless dreams.
</p>
<p>
His soul is even with the sun<br/>
Whose spirit and whose eye are one,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who seeks not stars by day, nor light<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And heavy heat of day by night.<br/>
Him can no God cast down, whom none<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can lift in hope beyond the height<br/>
Of fate and nature and things done<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the calm rule of might and right<br/>
That bids men be and bear and do,<br/>
And die beneath blind skies or blue.
</p>
<p>
To him the lights of even and morn<br/>
Speak no vain things of love or scorn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fancies and passions miscreate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By man in things dispassionate.<br/>
Nor holds he fellowship forlorn<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With souls that pray and hope and hate,<br/>
And doubt they had better not been born,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fain would lure or scare off fate<br/>
And charm their doomsman from their doom<br/>
And make fear dig its own false tomb.
</p>
<p>
He builds not half of doubts and half<br/>
Of dreams his own soul's cenotaph,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence hopes and fears with helpless eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapt loose in cast-off cerecloths, rise<br/>
And dance and wring their hands and laugh,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And weep thin tears and sigh light sighs,<br/>
And without living lips would quaff<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The living spring in man that lies,<br/>
And drain his soul of faith and strength<br/>
It might have lived on a life's length.
</p>
<p>
He hath given himself and hath not sold<br/>
To God for heaven or man for gold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or grief for comfort that it gives,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or joy for grief's restoratives.<br/>
He hath given himself to time, whose fold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuts in the mortal flock that lives<br/>
On its plain pasture's heat and cold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the equal year's alternatives.<br/>
Earth, heaven, and time, death, life, and he,<br/>
Endure while they shall be to be.
</p>
<p>
"Yet between death and life are hours<br/>
To flush with love and hide in flowers;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What profit save in these?" men cry:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, see, between soft earth and sky,<br/>
What only good things here are ours!"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They say, "what better wouldst thou try,<br/>
What sweeter sing of? or what powers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Serve, that will give thee ere thou die<br/>
More joy to sing and be less sad,<br/>
More heart to play and grow more glad?"
</p>
<p>
Play then and sing; we too have played,<br/>
We likewise, in that subtle shade.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We too have twisted through our hair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such tendrils as the wild Loves wear,<br/>
And heard what mirth the MÃ¦nads made,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the wind blew our garlands bare<br/>
And left their roses disarrayed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And smote the summer with strange air,<br/>
And disengirdled and discrowned<br/>
The limbs and locks that vine-wreaths bound.
</p>
<p>
We too have tracked by star-proof trees<br/>
The tempest of the Thyiades<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scare the loud night on hills that hid<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood-feasts of the Bassarid,<br/>
Heard their song's iron cadences<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fright the wolf hungering from the kid,<br/>
Outroar the lion-throated seas,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Outchide the north-wind if it chid,<br/>
And hush the torrent-tongued ravines<br/>
With thunders of their tambourines.
</p>
<p>
But the fierce flute whose notes acclaim<br/>
Dim goddesses of fiery fame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cymbal and clamorous kettledrum,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Timbrels and tabrets, all are dumb<br/>
That turned
the high chill air to flame;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The singing tongues of fire are numb<br/>
That called on Cotys by her name<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Edonian, till they felt her come<br/>
And maddened, and her mystic face<br/>
Lightened along the streams of Thrace.
</p>
<p>
For Pleasure slumberless and pale,<br/>
And Passion with rejected veil,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass, and the tempest-footed throng<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of hours that follow them with song<br/>
Till their feet flag and voices fail,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lips that were so loud so long<br/>
Learn silence, or a wearier wail;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So keen is change, and time so strong,<br/>
To weave the robes of life and rend<br/>
And weave again till life have end.
</p>
<p>
But weak is change, but strengthless time,<br/>
To take the light from heaven, or climb<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hills of heaven with wasting feet.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Songs they can stop that earth found meet,<br/>
But the stars keep their ageless rhyme;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowers they can slay that spring thought sweet,<br/>
But the stars keep their spring sublime;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Passions and pleasures can defeat,<br/>
Actions and agonies control,<br/>
And life and death, but not the soul.
</p>
<p>
Because man's soul is man's God still,<br/>
What wind soever waft his will<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the waves of day and night<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To port or shipwreck, left or right,<br/>
By shores and shoals of good and ill;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And still its flame at mainmast height<br/>
Through the rent air that foam-flakes fill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustains the indomitable light<br/>
Whence only man hath strength to steer<br/>
Or helm to handle without fear.
</p>
<p>
Save his own soul's light overhead,<br/>
None leads him, and none ever led,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Across birth's hidden harbour-bar,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Past youth where shoreward shallows are,<br/>
Through age that drives on toward the red<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Vast void of sunset hailed from far,<br/>
To the equal waters of the dead;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save his own soul he hath no star,<br/>
And sinks, except his own soul guide,<br/>
Helmless in middle turn of tide.
</p>
<p>
No blast of air or fire of sun<br/>
Puts out the light whereby we run<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With girded loins our lamplit race,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And each from each takes heart of grace<br/>
And spirit till his turn be done,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And light of face from each man's face<br/>
In whom the light of trust is one;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since only souls that keep their place<br/>
By their own light, and watch things roll,<br/>
And stand, have light for any soul.
</p>
<p>
A little time we gain from time<br/>
To set our seasons in some chime,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For harsh or sweet or loud or low,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With seasons played out long ago<br/>
And souls that in their time and prime<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Took part with summer or with snow,<br/>
Lived abject lives out or sublime,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And had their chance of seed to sow<br/>
For service or disservice done<br/>
To those days daed and this their son.
</p>
<p>
A little time that we may fill<br/>
Or with such good works or such ill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As loose the bonds or make them strong<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein all manhood suffers wrong.<br/>
By rose-hung river and light-foot rill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There are who rest not; who think long<br/>
Till they discern as from a hill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At the sun's hour of morning song,<br/>
Known of souls only, and those souls free,<br/>
The sacred spaces of the sea.

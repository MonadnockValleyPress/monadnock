<h1>A Watch in the Night</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>1</h3>
<p>
Watchman, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Storm and thunder and rain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lights that waver and wane,<br/>
Leaving the watchfires unlit.<br/>
Only the balefires are bright,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the flash of the lamps now and then<br/>
From a palace where spoilers sit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Trampling the children of men.
</p>
<h3>2</h3>
<p>
Prophet, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand by the verge of the sea,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Banished, uncomforted, free,<br/>
Hearing the noise of the waves<br/>
And sudden flashes that smite<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some man's tyrannous head,<br/>
Thundering, heard among graves<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That hide the hosts of his dead.
</p>
<h3>3</h3>
<p>
Mourners, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All night through without sleep<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We weep, and we weep, and we weep.<br/>
Who shall give us our sons?<br/>
Beaks of raven and kite,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mouths of wolf and of hound,<br/>
Give us them back whom the guns<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot for you dead on the ground.
</p>
<h3>4</h3>
<p>
Dead men, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannon and scaffold and sword,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Horror of gibbet and cord,<br/>
Mowed us as sheaves for the grave,<br/>
Mowed us down for the right.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not grudge or repent.<br/>
Freely to freedom we gave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pledges, till life should be spent.
</p>
<h3>5</h3>
<p>
Statesman, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The night will last me my time.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold on a crown or a crime<br/>
Looks well enough yet by the lamps.<br/>
Have we not fingers to write,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lips to swear at a need?<br/>
Then, when danger decamps,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bury the word with the deed.
</p>
<h3>6</h3>
<p>
Warrior, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it be not or be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Night, is as one thing to me.<br/>
I for one, at the least,<br/>
Ask not of dews if they blight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask not of flames if they slay,<br/>
Ask not of prince or of priest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How long ere we put them away.
</p>
<h3>7</h3>
<p>
Master, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Child, night is not at all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Anywhere, fallen or to fall,<br/>
Save in our star-stricken eyes.<br/>
Forth of our eyes it takes flight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look we but once nor before<br/>
Nor behind us, but straight on the skies;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Night is not then any more.
</p>
<h3>8</h3>
<p>
Exile, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The tides and the hours run out,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The seasons of death and of doubt,<br/>
The night-watches bitter and sore.<br/>
In the quicksands leftward and right<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My feet sink down under me;<br/>
But I know the scents of the shore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the broad blown breaths of the sea.
</p>
<h3>9</h3>
<p>
Captives, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It rains outside overhead<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Always, a rain that is red,<br/>
And our faces are soiled with the rain.<br/>
Here in the seasons' despite<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Day-time and night-time are one,<br/>
Till the curse of the kings and the chain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Break, and their toils be undone.
</p>
<h3>10</h3>
<p>
Christian, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot tell; I am blind.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I halt and hearken behind<br/>
If haply the hours will go back<br/>
And return to the dear dead light,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the watchfires and stars that of old<br/>
Shone where the sky now is black,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Glowed where the earth now is cold.
</p>
<h3>11</h3>
<p>
High priest, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is horrible here<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With haggard faces and fear,<br/>
Blood, and the burning of fire.<br/>
Mine eyes are emptied of sight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine hands are full of the dust.<br/>
If the God of my faith be a liar,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is it that I shall trust?
</p>
<h3>12</h3>
<p>
Princes, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Night with pestilent breath<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeds us, children of death,<br/>
Clothes us close with her gloom.<br/>
Rapine and famine and fright<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Crouch at our feet and are fed.<br/>
Earth where we pass is a tomb,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Life where we triumph is dead.
</p>
<h3>13</h3>
<p>
Martyrs, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, is it night with you yet?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We, for our part, we forget<br/>
What night was, if it were.<br/>
The loud red mouths of the fight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are silent and shut where we are.<br/>
In our eyes the tempestuous air<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shines as the face of a star.
</p>
<h3>14</h3>
<p>
England, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Night is for slumber and sleep,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm, no season to weep.<br/>
Let me alone till the day.<br/>
Sleep would I still if I might,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have slept for two hundred years.<br/>
Once I had honour, they say;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But slumber is sweeter than tears.
</p>
<h3>15</h3>
<p>
France, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Night is the prostitute's noon,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kissed and drugged till she swoon,<br/>
Spat upon, trod upon, whored.<br/>
With bloodred rose-garlands dight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Round me reels in the dance<br/>
Death, my saviour, my lord,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowned; there is no more France.
</p>
<h3>16</h3>
<p>
Italy, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, child, child, it is long!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Moonbeam and starbeam and song<br/>
Leave it dumb now and dark.<br/>
Yet I perceive on the height<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Eastward, not now very far,<br/>
A song too loud for the lark,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A light too strong for a star.
</p>
<h3>17</h3>
<p>
Germany, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Long has it lulled me with dreams;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at midwatch, as it seems,<br/>
Light is brought back to mine eyes,<br/>
And the mastery of old and the might<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives in the joints of mine hands,<br/>
Steadies my limbs as they rise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthens my foot as it stands.
</p>
<h3>18</h3>
<p>
Europe, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask of heaven, and the sea,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And my babes on the bosom of me,<br/>
Nations of mine, but ungrown.<br/>
There is one who shall surely requite<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All that endure or that err:<br/>
She can answer alone:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask not of me, but of her.
</p>
<h3>19</h3>
<p>
Liberty, what of the night?&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel not the red rains fall,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear not the tempest at all,<br/>
Nor thunder in heaven any more.<br/>
All the distance is white<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the soundless feet of the sun.<br/>
Night, with the woes that it wore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Night is over and done.

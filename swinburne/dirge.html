<h1>Dirge</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
A bell tolls on in my heart<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As though in my ears a knell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had ceased for awhile to swell,<br/>
But the sense of it would not part<br/>
From the spirit that bears its part<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the chime of the soundless bell.
</p>
<p>
Ah dear dead singer of sorrow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The burden is now not thine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That grief bade sound for a sign<br/>
Through the songs of the night whose morrow<br/>
Has risen, and I may not borrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A beam from its radiant shrine.
</p>
<p>
The burden has dropped from thee<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That grief on thy life bound fast;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The winter is over and past<br/>
Whose end thou wast fain to see.<br/>
Shall sorrow not comfort me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is thine no longer&mdash;at last?
</p>
<p>
Good day, good night, and good morrow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Men living and mourning say.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For thee we could only pray<br/>
That night of the day might borrow<br/>
Such comfort as dreams lend sorrow:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Death gives thee at last good day.

<h1>Erotion</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
Sweet for a little even to fear, and sweet,<br/>
O love, to lay down fear at love's fair feet;<br/>
Shall not some fiery memory of his breath<br/>
Lie sweet on lips that touch the lips of death?<br/>
Yet leave me not; yet, if thou wilt, be free;<br/>
Love me no more, but love my love of thee.<br/>
Love where thou wilt, and live thy life; and I,<br/>
One thing I can, and one love cannot&mdash;die.<br/>
Pass from me; yet thine arms, thine eyes, thine hair,<br/>
Feed my desire and deaden my despair.<br/>
Yet once more ere time change us, ere my cheek<br/>
Whiten, ere hope be dumb or sorrow speak,<br/>
Yet once more ere thou hate me, one full kiss;<br/>
Keep other hours for others, save me this.<br/>
Yea, and I will not (if it please thee) weep,<br/>
Lest thou be sad; I will but sigh, and sleep.<br/>
Sweet, does death hurt? thou canst not do me wrong:<br/>
I shall not lack thee, as I loved thee, long.<br/>
Hast thou not given me above all that live<br/>
Joy, and a little sorrow shalt not give?<br/>
What even though fairer fingers of strange girls<br/>
Pass nestling through thy beautiful boy's curls<br/>
As mine did, or those curled lithe lips of thine<br/>
Meet theirs as these, all theirs come after mine;<br/>
And though I were not, though I be not, best,<br/>
I have loved and love thee more than all the rest.<br/>
O love, O lover, loose or hold me fast,<br/>
I had thee first, whoever have thee last;<br/>
Fairer or not, what need I know, what care?<br/>
To thy fair bud my blossom once seemed fair.<br/>
Why am I fair at all before thee, why<br/>
At all desired? seeing thou art fair, not I.<br/>
I shall be glad of thee, O fairest head,<br/>
Alive, alone, without thee, with thee, dead;<br/>
I shall remember while the light lives yet,<br/>
And in the night-time I shall not forget.<br/>
Though (as thou wilt) thou leave me ere life leave,<br/>
I will not, for thy love I will not, grieve;<br/>
Not as they use who love not more than I,<br/>
Who love not as I love thee though I die;<br/>
And though thy lips, once mine, be oftener prest<br/>
To many another brow and balmier breast,<br/>
And sweeter arms, or sweeter to thy mind,<br/>
Lull thee or lure, more fond thou wilt not find.

<h1>Dedication</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
The years are many, the changes more,<br/>
Since wind and sun on the wild sweet shore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Joyous Gard stands stark by the sea<br/>
With face as bright as in years of yore
</p>
<p>
Shone, swept, and sounded, and laughed for glee<br/>
More deep than a man's or a child's may be,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On a day when summer was wild and glad,<br/>
And the guests of the wind and the sun were we.
</p>
<p>
The light that lightens from seasons clad<br/>
With darkness now, is it glad or sad?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not sad but glad should it shine, meseems,<br/>
On eyes yet fain of the joy they had.
</p>
<p>
For joy was there with us; joy that gleams<br/>
And murmurs yet in the world of dreams<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where thought holds fast, as a constant warder,<br/>
The days when I rode by moors and streams,
</p>
<p>
Reining my rhymes into buoyant order<br/>
Through honied leagues of the northland border.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though thought or memory fade, and prove<br/>
A faithless keeper, a thriftless hoarder,
</p>
<p>
One landmark never can change remove,<br/>
One sign can the years efface not. Love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More strong than death or than doubt may be,<br/>
Treads down their strengths, and abides above.
</p>
<p>
Yea, change and death are his servants: we,<br/>
Whom love of the dead links fast, though free,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May smile as they that beheld the dove<br/>
Bear home her signal across the sea.
</p>

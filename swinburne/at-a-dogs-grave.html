<h1>At a Dog's Grave</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
Good night, we say, when comes the time to win<br/>
The daily death divine that shuts up sight,<br/>
Sleep, that assures for all who dwell therein<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good night.
</p>
<p>
The shadow shed round those we love shines bright<br/>
As love's own face, when death, sleep's gentler twin,<br/>
From them divides us even as night from light.
</p>
<p>
Shall friends born lower in life, though pure of sin,<br/>
Though clothed with love and faith to usward plight,<br/>
Perish and pass unbidden of us, their kin,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good night?
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
To die a dog's death once was held for shame.<br/>
Not all men so beloved and mourned shall lie<br/>
As many of these, whose time untimely came<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To die.
</p>
<p>
His years were full: his years were joyous: why<br/>
Must love be sorrow, when his gracious name<br/>
Recalls his lovely life of limb and eye?<br/>
</p>
<p>
If aught of blameless life on earth may claim<br/>
Life higher than death, though death's dark wave rise high,<br/>
Such life as this among us never came<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To die.
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
White violets, there by hands more sweet than they<br/>
Planted, shall sweeten April's flowerful air<br/>
About a grave that shows to night and day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White violets there.
</p>
<p>
A child's light hands, whose touch makes flowers more fair,<br/>
Keep fair as these for many a March and May<br/>
The light of days that are because they were.
</p>
<p>
It shall not like a blossom pass away;<br/>
It broods and brightens with the days that bear<br/>
Fresh fruits of love, but leave, as love might pray,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White violets there.

<h1>The Palace of Pan</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>Inscribed to my Mother</h3>
<p>
September, all glorious with gold, as a king<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the radiance of triumph attired,<br/>
Outlightening the summer, outsweetening the spring,<br/>
Broods wide on the woodlands with limitless wing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A presence of all men desired.
</p>
<p>
Far eastward and westward the sun-coloured lands<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile warm as the light on them smiles;<br/>
And statelier than temples upbuilded with hands,<br/>
Tall column by column, the sanctuary stands<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the pine-forest's infinite aisles.
</p>
<p>
Mute worship, too fervent for praise or for prayer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Possesses the spirit with peace,<br/>
Fulfilled with the breath of the luminous air,<br/>
The fragrance, the silence, the shadows as fair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As the rays that recede or increase.
</p>
<p>
Ridged pillars that redden aloft and aloof,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With never a branch for a nest,<br/>
Sustain the sublime indivisible roof,<br/>
To the storm and the sun in his majesty proof,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And awful as waters at rest.
</p>
<p>
Man's hand hath not measured the height of them; thought<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May measure not, awe may not know;<br/>
In its shadow the woofs of the woodland are wrought;<br/>
As a bird is the sun in the toils of them caught,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the flakes of it scattered as snow.
</p>
<p>
As the shreds of a plumage of gold on the ground<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun-flakes by multitudes lie,<br/>
Shed loose as the petals of roses discrowned<br/>
On the floors of the forest engilt and embrowned<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And reddened afar and anigh.
</p>
<p>
Dim centuries with darkling inscrutable hands<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have reared and secluded the shrine<br/>
For gods that we know not, and kindled as brands<br/>
On the altar the years that are dust, and their sands<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Time's glass has forgotten for sign.
</p>
<p>
A temple whose transepts are measured by miles,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose chancel has morning for priest,<br/>
Whose floor-work the foot of no spoiler defiles,<br/>
Whose musical silence no music beguiles,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No festivals limit its feast.
</p>
<p>
The noon's ministration, the night's and the dawn's,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Conceals not, reveals not for man,<br/>
On the slopes of the herbless and blossomless lawns,<br/>
Some track of a nymph's or some trail of a faun's<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the place of the slumber of Pan.
</p>
<p>
Thought, kindled and quickened by worship and wonder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To rapture too sacred for fear<br/>
On the ways that unite or divide them in sunder,<br/>
Alone may discern if about them or under<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be token or trace of him here.
</p>
<p>
With passionate awe that is deeper than panic<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit subdued and unshaken<br/>
Takes heed of the godhead terrene and Titanic<br/>
Whose footfall is felt on the breach of volcanic<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp steeps that their fire has forsaken.
</p>
<p>
By a spell more serene than the dim necromantic<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead charms of the past and the night,<br/>
Or the terror that lurked in the noon to make frantic<br/>
Where Etna takes shape from the limbs of gigantic<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead gods disanointed of might,
</p>
<p>
The spirit made one with the spirit whose breath<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes noon in the woodland sublime<br/>
Abides as entranced in a presence that saith<br/>
Things loftier than life and serener than death,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Triumphant and silent as time.
</p>

<h1>Sestina</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
I saw my soul at rest upon a day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a bird sleeping in the nest of night,<br/>
Among soft leaves that give the starlight way<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To touch its wings but not its eyes with light;<br/>
So that it knew as one in visions may,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knew not as men waking, of delight.
</p>
<p>
This was the measure of my soul's delight;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had no power of joy to fly by day,<br/>
Nor part in the large lordship of the light;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a secret moon-beholden way<br/>
Had all its will of dreams and pleasant night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the love and life that sleepers may.
</p>
<p>
But such life's triumph as men waking may<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might not have to feed its faint delight<br/>
Between the stars by night and sun by day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut up with green leaves and a little light;<br/>
Because its way was as a lost star's way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A world's not wholly known of day or night.
</p>
<p>
All loves and dreams and sounds and gleams of night<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made it all music that such minstrels may,<br/>
And all they had they gave it of delight;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the full face of the fire of day<br/>
What place shall be for any starry light,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What part of heaven in all the wide sun's way?
</p>
<p>
Yet the soul woke not, sleeping by the way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched as a nursling of the large-eyed night,<br/>
And sought no strength nor knowledge of the day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor closer touch conclusive of delight,<br/>
Nor mightier joy nor truer than dreamers may,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor more of song than they, nor more of light.
</p>
<p>
For who sleeps once and sees the secret light<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereby sleep shows the soul a fairer way<br/>
Between the rise and rest of day and night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall care no more to fare as all men may,<br/>
But be his place of pain or of delight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall he dwell, beholding night as day.
</p>
<p>
Song, have thy day and take thy fill of light<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the night be fallen across thy way;<br/>
Sing while he may, man hath no long delight.<br/>

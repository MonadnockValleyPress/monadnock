<h1>The Emperor's Progress</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>A Study in Three Stages</h3>
<p>(On the Busts of Nero in the Uffizj.)</p>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>
A child of brighter than the morning's birth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lovelier than all smiles that may be smiled<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save only of little children undefiled,<br/>
Sweet, perfect, witless of their own dear worth,<br/>
Live rose of love, mute melody of mirth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glad as a bird is when the woods are mild,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adorable as is nothing save a child,<br/>
Hails with wide eyes and lips his life on earth,<br/>
His lovely life with all its heaven to be.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whoso reads the name inscribed or hears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feels his own heart a frozen well of tears,<br/>
Child, for deep dread and fearful pity of thee<br/>
Whom God would not let rather die than see<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incumbent horror of impending years.
</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>
Man, that wast godlike being a child, and now,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No less than kinglike, art no more in sooth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all thy grace and lordliness of youth,<br/>
The crown that bids men's branded foreheads bow<br/>
Much more has branded and bowed down thy brow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gnawn upon it as with fire or tooth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of steel or snake so sorely, that the truth<br/>
Seems here to bear false witness. Is it thou,<br/>
Child? and is all the summer of all thy spring<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This? are the smiles that drew men's kisses down<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All faded and transfigured to the frown<br/>
That grieves thy face? Art thou this weary thing?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then is no slave's load heavier than a crown<br/>
And such a thrall no bondman as a king.
</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>
Misery, beyond all men's most miserable,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolute, whole, defiant of defence,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inevitable, inexplacable, intense,<br/>
More vast than heaven is high, more deep than hell,<br/>
Past cure or charm of solace or of spell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possesses and pervades the spirit and sense<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereto the expanse of the earth pays tribute; whence<br/>
Breeds evil only, and broods on fumes that swell<br/>
Rank from the blood of brother and mother and wife.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Misery of miseries, all is misery," saith<br/>
The heavy fair-faced hateful head, at strife<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its own lusts that burn with feverous breath<br/>
Lips which the loathsome bitterness of life<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaves fearful of the bitterness of death.

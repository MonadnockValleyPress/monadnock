<h1>In Memory of John William Inchbold</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
Farewell: how should not such as thou fare well,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we fare ill that love thee, and that live,<br/>
And know, whate'er the days wherein we dwell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May give us, thee again they will not give?
</p>
<p>
Peace, rest, and sleep are all we know of death,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all we dream of comfort: yet for thee,<br/>
Whose breath of life was bright and strenuous breath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We think the change is other than we see.
</p>
<p>
The seal of sleep set on thine eyes to-day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely can seal not up the keen swift light<br/>
That lit them once for ever. Night can slay<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;None save the children of the womb of night.
</p>
<p>
The fire that burns up dawn to bring forth noon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was father of thy spirit: how shouldst thou<br/>
Die as they die for whom the sun and moon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are silent? Thee the darkness holds not now:
</p>
<p>
Them, while they looked upon the light, and deemed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That life was theirs for living in the sun,<br/>
The darkness held in bondage: and they dreamed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knew not that such life as theirs was none.
</p>
<p>
To thee the sun spake, and the morning sang<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Notes deep and clear as life or heaven: the sea<br/>
That sounds for them but wild waste music rang<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Notes that were lost not when they rang for thee.
</p>
<p>
The mountains clothed with light and night and change,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The lakes alive with wind and cloud and sun,<br/>
Made answer, by constraint sublime and strange,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the ardent hand that bade thy will be done.
</p>
<p>
We may not bid the mountains mourn, the sea<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That lived and lightened from thine hand again<br/>
Moan, as of old would men that mourned as we<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A man beloved, a man elect of men,
</p>
<p>
A man that loved them. Vain, divine and vain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream that touched with thoughts or tears of ours<br/>
The spirit of sense that lives in sun and rain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sings out in birds, and breathes and fades in flowers.
</p>
<p>
Not for our joy they live, and for our grief<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They die not. Though thine eye be closed, thine hand<br/>
Powerless as mine to paint them, not a leaf<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In English woods or glades of Switzerland
</p>
<p>
Falls earlier now, fades faster. All our love<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Moves not our mother's changeless heart, who gives<br/>
A little light to eyes and stars above,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A little life to each man's heart that lives.
</p>
<p>
A little life to heaven and earth and sea,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To stars and souls revealed of night and day,<br/>
And change, the one thing changeless: yet shall she<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cease too, perchance, and perish. Who shall say?
</p>
<p>
Our mother Nature, dark and sweet as sleep,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And strange as life and strong as death, holds fast,<br/>
Even as she holds our hearts alive, the deep<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dumb secret of her first-born births and last.
</p>
<p>
But this, we know, shall cease not till the strife<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nights and days and fears and hopes find end;<br/>
This, through the brief eternities of life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Endures, and calls from death a living friend;
</p>
<p>
The love made strong with knowledge, whence confirmed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole soul takes assurance, and the past<br/>
(So by time's measure, not by memory's, termed)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives present life, and mingles first with last.
</p>
<p>
I, now long since thy guest of many days,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who found thy hearth a brother's, and with thee<br/>
Tracked in and out the lines of rolling bays<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And banks and gulfs and reaches of the sea&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Deep dens wherein the wrestling water sobs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And pants with restless pain of refluent breath<br/>
Till all the sunless hollow sounds and throbs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With ebb and flow of eddies dark as death&mdash;
</p>
<p>
I know not what more glorious world, what waves<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More bright with life,&mdash;if brighter aught may live<br/>
Than those that filled and fled their tidal caves&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May now give back the love thou hast to give.
</p>
<p>
Tintagel, and the long Trebarwith sand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lone Camelford, and Boscastle divine<br/>
With dower of southern blossom, bright and bland<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the roar of granite-baffled brine,
</p>
<p>
Shall hear no more by joyous night or day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From downs or causeways good to rove and ride<br/>
Or feet of ours or horse-hoofs urge their way<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That sped us here and there by tower and tide.
</p>
<p>
The headlands and the hollows and the waves,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For all our love, forget us: where I am<br/>
Thou art not: deeper sleeps the shadow on graves<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than in the sunless gulf that once we swam.
</p>
<p>
Thou hast swum too soon the sea of death: for us<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Too soon, but if truth bless love's blind belief<br/>
Faith, born of hope and memory, says not thus:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And joy for thee for me should mean not grief.
</p>
<p>
And joy for thee, if ever soul of man<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found joy in change and life of ampler birth<br/>
Than here pens in the spirit for a span,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Must be the life that doubt calls death on earth.
</p>
<p>
For if, beyond the shadow and the sleep,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A place there be for souls without a stain,<br/>
Where peace is perfect, and delight more deep<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than seas or skies that change and shine again,
</p>
<p>
There none of all unsullied souls that live<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May hold a surer station: none may lend<br/>
More light to hope's or memory's lamp, nor give<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More joy than thine to those that called thee friend.
</p>
<p>
Yea, joy from sorrow's barren womb is born<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When faith begets on grief the godlike child:<br/>
As midnight yearns with starry sense of morn<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Arctic summers, though the sea wax wild,
</p>
<p>
So love, whose name is memory, thrills at heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembering and rejoicing in thee, now<br/>
Alive where love may dream not what thou art<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But knows that higher than hope or love art thou.
</p>
<p>
"Whatever heaven, if heaven at all may be,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Await the sacred souls of good men dead,<br/>
There, now we mourn who loved him here, is he,"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So, sweet and stern of speech, the Roman said,
</p>
<p>
Erect in grief, in trust erect, and gave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His deathless dead a deathless life even here<br/>
Where day bears down on day as wave on wave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And not man's smile fades faster than his tear.
</p>
<p>
Albeit this gift be given not me to give,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor power be mine to break time's silent spell,<br/>
Not less shall love that dies not while I live<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bid thee, beloved in life and death, farewell.

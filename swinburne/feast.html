<h1>For the Feast of Giordano Bruno, Philosopher and Martyr</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
Son of the lightning and the light that glows<br/>
Beyond the lightning's or the morning's light,<br/>
Soul splendid with all-righteous love of right,<br/>
In whose keen fire all hopes and fears and woes<br/>
Were clean consumed, and from their ashes rose<br/>
Transfigured, and intolerable to sight<br/>
Save of purged eyes whose lids had cast off night,<br/>
In love's and wisdom's likeness when they close,<br/>
Embracing, and between them truth stands fast,<br/>
Embraced of either; thou whose feet were set<br/>
On English earth while this was England yet,<br/>
Our friend that art, our Sidney's friend that wast,<br/>
Heart hardier found and higher than all men's past,<br/>
Shall we not praise thee though thine own forget?
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
Lift up thy light on us and on thine own,<br/>
O soul whose spirit on earth was as a rod<br/>
To scourge off priests, a sword to pierce their God,<br/>
A staff for man's free thought to walk alone,<br/>
A lamp to lead him far from shrine and throne<br/>
On ways untrodden where his fathers trod<br/>
Ere earth's heart withered at a high priest's nod<br/>
And all men's mouths that made not prayer made moan.<br/>
From bonds and torments and the ravening flame<br/>
Surely thy spirit of sense rose up to greet<br/>
Lucretius, where such only spirits meet,<br/>
And walk with him apart till Shelley came<br/>
To make the heaven of heavens more heavenly sweet<br/>
And mix with yours a third incorporate name.

<h1>On the South Coast</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">To Theodore Watts</span></h3>
<p>
Hills and valleys where April rallies his radiant squadron of flowers and birds,<br/>
Steep strange beaches and lustrous reaches of fluctuant sea that the land engirds,<br/>
Fields and downs that the sunrise crowns with life diviner than lives in words,
</p>
<p>
Day by day of resurgent May salute the sun with sublime acclaim,<br/>
Change and brighten with hours that lighten and darken, girdled with cloud or flame;<br/>
Earth's fair face in alternate grace beams, blooms, and lowers, and is yet the same.
</p>
<p>
Twice each day the divine sea's play makes glad with glory that comes and goes<br/>
Field and street that her waves keep sweet, when past the bounds of their old repose,<br/>
Fast and fierce in renewed reverse, the foam-flecked estuary ebbs and flows.
</p>
<p>
Broad and bold through the stays of old staked fast with trunks of the wildwood tree,<br/>
Up from shoreward, impelled far forward, by marsh and meadow, by lawn and lea,<br/>
Inland still at her own wild will swells, rolls, and revels the surging sea.
</p>
<p>
Strong as time, and as faith sublime,&mdash;clothed round with shadows of hopes and fears,<br/>
Nights and morrows, and joys and sorrows, alive with passion of prayers and tears,&mdash;<br/>
Stands the shrine that has seen decline eight hundred waxing and waning years.
</p>
<p>
Tower set square to the storms of air and change of season that glooms and glows,<br/>
Wall and roof of it tempest-proof, and equal ever to suns and snows,<br/>
Bright with riches of radiant niches and pillars smooth as a straight stem grows.
</p>
<p>
Aisle and nave that the whelming wave of time has whelmed not or touched or neared,<br/>
Arch and vault without stain or fault, by hands of craftsmen we know not reared,<br/>
Time beheld them, and time was quelled; and change passed by them as one that feared.
</p>
<p>
Time that flies as a dream, and dies as dreams that die with the sleep they feed,<br/>
Here alone in a garb of stone incarnate stands as a god indeed,<br/>
Stern and fair, and of strength to bear all burdens mortal to man's frail seed.
</p>
<p>
Men and years are as leaves or tears that storm or sorrow is fain to shed:<br/>
These go by as the winds that sigh, and none takes note of them quick or dead:<br/>
Time, whose breath is their birth and death, folds here his pinions, and bows his head.
</p>
<p>
Still the sun that beheld begun the work wrought here of unwearied hands<br/>
Sees, as then, though the Red King's men held ruthless rule over lawless lands,<br/>
Stand their massive design, impassive, pure and proud as a virgin stands.
</p>
<p>
Statelier still as the years fulfil their count, subserving her sacred state,<br/>
Grows the hoary grey church whose story silence utters and age makes great:<br/>
Statelier seems it than shines in dreams the face unveiled of unvanquished fate.
</p>
<p>
Fate, more high than the star-shown sky, more deep than waters unsounded, shines<br/>
Keen and far as the final star on souls that seek not for charms or signs;<br/>
Yet more bright is the love-shown light of men's hands lighted in songs or shrines.
</p>
<p>
Love and trust that the grave's deep dust can soil not, neither may fear put out,<br/>
Witness yet that their record set stands fast, though years be as hosts in rout,<br/>
Spent and slain; but the signs remain that beat back darkness and cast forth doubt.
</p>
<p>
Men that wrought by the grace of thought and toil things goodlier than praise dare trace,<br/>
Fair as all that the world may call most fair, save only the sea's own face,<br/>
Shrines or songs that the world's change wrongs not, live by grace of their own gift's grace.
</p>
<p>
Dead, their names that the night reclaims&mdash;alive, their works that the day relumes&mdash;<br/>
Sink and stand, as in stone and sand engraven: none may behold their tombs:<br/>
Nights and days shall record their praise while here this flower of their grafting blooms.
</p>
<p>
Flower more fair than the sun-thrilled air bids laugh and lighten and wax and rise,<br/>
Fruit more bright than the fervent light sustains with strength from the kindled skies,<br/>
Flower and fruit that the deathless root of man's love rears though the man's name dies.
</p>
<p>
Stately stands it, the work of hands unknown of: statelier, afar and near,<br/>
Rise around it the heights that bound our landward gaze from the seaboard here;<br/>
Downs that swerve and aspire, in curve and change of heights that the dawn holds dear.
</p>
<p>
Dawn falls fair on the grey walls there confronting dawn, on the low green lea,<br/>
Lone and sweet as for fairies' feet held sacred, silent and strange and free,<br/>
Wild and wet with its rills; but yet more fair falls dawn on the fairer sea.
</p>
<p>
Eastward, round by the high green bound of hills that fold the remote fields in,<br/>
Strive and shine on the low sea-line fleet waves and beams when the days begin;<br/>
Westward glow, when the days burn low, the sun that yields and the stars that win.
</p>
<p>
Rose-red eve on the seas that heave sinks fair as dawn when the first ray peers;<br/>
Winds are glancing from sunbright Lancing to Shoreham, crowned with the grace of years;<br/>
Shoreham, clad with the sunset, glad and grave with glory that death reveres.
</p>
<p>
Death, more proud than the kings' heads bowed before him, stronger than all things, bows<br/>
Here his head: as if death were dead, and kingship plucked from his crownless brows,<br/>
Life hath here such a face of cheer as change appals not and time avows.
</p>
<p>
Skies fulfilled with the sundown, stilled and splendid, spread as a flower that spreads,<br/>
Pave with rarer device and fairer than heaven's the luminous oyster-beds,<br/>
Grass-embanked, and in square plots ranked, inlaid with gems that the sundown sheds.
</p>
<p>
Squares more bright and with lovelier light than heaven that kindled it shines with shine<br/>
Warm and soft as the dome aloft, but heavenlier yet than the sun's own shrine:<br/>
Heaven is high, but the water-sky lit here seems deeper and more divine.
</p>
<p>
Flowers on flowers, that the whole world's bowers may show not, here may the sunset show,<br/>
Lightly graven in the waters paven with ghostly gold by the clouds aglow:<br/>
Bright as love is the vault above, but lovelier lightens the wave below.
</p>
<p>
Rosy grey, or as fiery spray full-plumed, or greener than emerald, gleams<br/>
Plot by plot as the skies allot for each its glory, divine as dreams<br/>
Lit with fire of appeased desire which sounds the secret of all that seems;
</p>
<p>
Dreams that show what we fain would know, and know not save by the grace of sleep,<br/>
Sleep whose hands have removed the bands that eyes long waking and fain to weep<br/>
Feel fast bound on them&mdash;light around them strange, and darkness above them steep.
</p>
<p>
Yet no vision that heals division of love from love, and renews awhile<br/>
Life and breath in the lips where death has quenched the spirit of speech and smile,<br/>
Shows on earth, or in heaven's mid mirth, where no fears enter or doubts defile,
</p>
<p>
Aught more fair than the radiant air and water here by the twilight wed,<br/>
Here made one by the waning sun whose last love quickens to rosebright red<br/>
Half the crown of the soft high down that rears to northward its wood-girt head.
</p>
<p>
There, when day is at height of sway, men's eyes who stand, as we oft have stood,<br/>
High where towers with its world of flowers the golden spinny that flanks the wood,<br/>
See before and around them shore and seaboard glad as their gifts are good.
</p>
<p>
Higher and higher to the north aspire the green smooth-swelling unending downs;<br/>
East and west on the brave earth's breast glow girdle-jewels of gleaming towns;<br/>
Southward shining, the lands declining subside in peace that the sea's light crowns.
</p>
<p>
Westward wide in its fruitful pride the plain lies lordly with plenteous grace;<br/>
Fair as dawn's when the fields and lawns desire her glitters the glad land's face:<br/>
Eastward yet is the sole sign set of elder days and a lordlier race.
</p>
<p>
Down beneath us afar, where seethe in wilder weather the tides aflow,<br/>
Hurled up hither and drawn down thither in quest of rest that they may not know,<br/>
Still as dew on a flower the blue broad stream now sleeps in the fields below.
</p>
<p>
Mild and bland in the fair green land it smiles, and takes to its heart the sky;<br/>
Scarce the meads and the fens, the reeds and grasses, still as they stand or lie,<br/>
Wear the palm of a statelier calm than rests on waters that pass them by.
</p>
<p>
Yet shall these, when the winds and seas of equal days and coequal nights<br/>
Rage, rejoice, and uplift a voice whose sound is even as a sword that smites,<br/>
Felt and heard as a doomsman's word from seaward reaches to landward heights,
</p>
<p>
Lift their heart up, and take their part of triumph, swollen and strong with rage,<br/>
Rage elate with desire and great with pride that tempest and storm assuage;<br/>
So their chime in the ear of time has rung from age to rekindled age.
</p>
<p>
Fair and dear is the land's face here, and fair man's work as a man's may be:<br/>
Dear and fair as the sunbright air is here the record that speaks him free;<br/>
Free by birth of a sacred earth, and regent ever of all the sea.

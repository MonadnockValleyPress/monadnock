<h1>Inferiae</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
Spring, and the light and sound of things on earth<br/>
Requickening, all within our green sea's girth;<br/>
A time of passage or a time of birth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourscore years since as this year, first and last.
</p>
<p>
The sun is all about the world we see,<br/>
The breath and strength of very spring; and we<br/>
Live, love, and feed on our own hearts; but he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose heart fed mine has passed into the past.
</p>
<p>
Past, all things born with sense and blood and breath;<br/>
The flesh hears nought that now the spirit saith.<br/>
If death be like as birth and birth as death,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first was fair &mdash; more fair should be the last.
</p>
<p>
Fourscore years since, and come but one month more<br/>
The count were perfect of his mortal score<br/>
Whose sail went seaward yesterday from shore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cross the last of many an unsailed sea.
</p>
<p>
Light, love and labour up to life's last height,<br/>
These three were stars unsetting in his sight;<br/>
Even as the sun is life and heat and light<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sets not nor is dark when dark are we.
</p>
<p>
The life, the spirit, and the work were one<br/>
That here &mdash; ah, who shall say, that here are done?<br/>
Not I, that know not; father, not thy son,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the darkness of the night and sea.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>March 5, 1877</em>

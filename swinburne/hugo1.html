<h1>To Victor Hugo</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne (1866)</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fair days when God<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;By man as godlike trod,<br />
And each alike was Greek, alike was free,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;God's lightning spared, they said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone the happier head<br />
Whose laurels screened it; fruitless grace for thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom the high gods gave of right<br />
Their thunders and their laurels and their light.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunbeams and bays before<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our master's servants wore,<br />
For these Apollo left in all men's lands;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But far from these ere now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And watched with jealous brow<br />
Lay the blind lightnings shut between God's hands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And only loosed on slaves and kings<br />
The terror of the tempest of their wings.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in those younger years<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That shone with storms of spears<br />
And shook in the wind blown from a dead world's pyre,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;When by her back-blown hair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Napoleon caught the fair<br />
And fierce Republic with her feet of fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stayed with iron words and hands<br />
Her flight, and freedom in a thousand lands:<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou sawest the tides of things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Close over heads of kings,<br />
And thine hand felt the thunder, and to thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurels and lightnings were<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As sunbeams and soft air<br />
Mixed each in other, or as mist with sea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixed, or as memory with desire,<br />
Or the lute's pulses with the louder lyre.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For thee man's spirit stood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Disrobed of flesh and blood,<br />
And bare the heart of the most secret hours;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And to thine hand more tame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than birds in winter came<br />
High hopes and unknown flying forms of powers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And from thy table fed, and sang<br />
Till with the tune men's ears took fire and rang.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even all men's eyes and ears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With fiery sound and tears<br />
Waxed hot, and cheeks caught flame and eyelid light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;At those high songs of thine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That stung the sense like wine,<br />
Or fell more soft than dew or snow by night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wailed as in some flooded cave<br />
Sobs the strong broken spirit of a wave.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But we, our master, we<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose hearts, uplift to thee,<br />
Ache with the pulse of thy remembered song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;We ask not nor await<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the clenched hands of fate,<br />
As thou, remission of the world's old wrong;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Respite we ask not, nor release;<br />
Freedom a man may have, he shall not peace.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though thy most fiery hope<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Storm heaven, to set wide ope<br />
The all-sought-for gate whence God or Chance debars<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;All feet of men, all eyes&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The old night resumes her skies,<br />
Her hollow hiding-place of clouds and stars,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where nought save these is sure in sight;<br />
And, paven with death, our days are roofed with night.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing we can; to be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Awhile, as men may, free;<br />
But not by hope or pleasure the most stern<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Goddess, most awful-eyed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sits, but on either side<br />
Sit sorrow and the wrath of hearts that burn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad faith that cannot hope or fear,<br />
And memory grey with many a flowerless year.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that in stranger's wise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I lift not loving eyes<br />
To the fair foster-mother France, that gave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the pale fleet foam<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Help to my sires and home,<br />
Whose great sweet breast could shelter those and save<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom from her nursing breasts and hands<br />
Their land cast forth of old on gentler lands.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not without thoughts that ache<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For theirs and for thy sake,<br />
I, born of exiles, hail thy banished head;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I whose young song took flight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the great heat and light<br />
On me a child from thy far splendour shed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;From thine high place of soul and song,<br />
Which, fallen on eyes yet feeble, made them strong.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, not with lessening love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For memories born hereof,<br />
I look to that sweet mother-land, and see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The old fields and fair full streams,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And skies, but fled like dreams<br />
The feet of freedom and the thought of thee;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all between the skies and graves<br />
The mirth of mockers and the shame of slaves.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She, killed with noisome air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even she! and still so fair,<br />
Who said "Let there be freedom," and there was<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom; and as a lance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiery eyes of France<br />
Touched the world's sleep and as a sleep made pass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth of men's heavier ears and eyes<br />
Smitten with fire and thunder from new skies.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they men's friends indeed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who watch them weep and bleed?<br />
Because thou hast loved us, shall the gods love thee?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou, first of men and friend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seest thou, even thou, the end?<br />
Thou knowest what hath been, knowest thou what shall be?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Evils may pass and hopes endure;<br />
But fate is dim, and all the gods obscure.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O nursed in airs apart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;O poet highest of heart,<br />
Hast thou seen time, who hast seen so many things?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are not the years more wise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;More sad than keenest eyes,<br />
The years with soundless feet and sounding wings?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing we hear them not, but past<br />
The clamour of them thrills us, and their blast.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art chief of us, and lord;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy song is as a sword<br />
Keen-edged and scented in the blade from flowers;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art lord and king; but we<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift younger eyes, and see<br />
Less of high hope, less light on wandering hours;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hours that have borne men down so long,<br />
Seen the right fail, and watched uplift the wrong.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But thine imperial soul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As years and ruins roll<br />
To the same end, and all things and all dreams<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the same wreck and roar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drift on the dim same shore,<br />
Still in the bitter foam and brackish streams<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracks the fresh water-spring to be<br />
And sudden sweeter fountains in the sea.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As once the high God bound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a rivet round<br />
Man's saviour, and with iron nailed him through,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;At the wild end of things,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where even his own bird's wings<br />
Flagged, whence the sea shone like a drop of dew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;From Caucasus beheld below<br />
Past fathoms of unfathomable snow;<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So the strong God, the chance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Central of circumstance,<br />
Still shows him exile who will not be slave;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;All thy great fame and thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Girt by the dim strait sea<br />
With multitudinous walls of wandering wave;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shows us our greatest from his throne<br />
Fate-stricken, and rejected of his own.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, he is strong, thou say'st,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A mystery many-faced,<br />
The wild beasts know him and the wild birds flee;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The blind night sees him, death<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrinks beaten at his breath,<br />
And his right hand is heavy on the sea:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;We know he hath made us, and is king;<br />
We know not if he care for anything.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus much, no more, we know;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He bade what is be so,<br />
Bade light be and bade night be, one by one;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade hope and fear, bade ill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And good redeem and kill,<br />
Till all men be aweary of the sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his world burn in its own flame<br />
And bear no witness longer of his name.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet though all this be thus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be those men praised of us<br />
Who have loved and wrought and sorrowed and not sinned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For fame or fear or gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor waxed for winter cold,<br />
Nor changed for changes of the worldly wind;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Praised above men of men be these,<br />
Till this one world and work we know shall cease.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, one thing more than this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that one thing is,<br />
The splendour of a spirit without blame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That not the labouring years<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Blind-born, nor any fears,<br />
Nor men nor any gods can tire or tame;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But purer power with fiery breath<br />
Fills, and exalts above the gulfs of death.<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Praised above men be thou,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose laurel-laden brow,<br />
Made for the morning, droops not in the night;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Praised and beloved, that none<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all thy great things done<br />
Flies higher than thy most equal spirit's flight;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Praised, that nor doubt nor hope could bend<br />
Earth's loftiest head, found upright to the end.<br />

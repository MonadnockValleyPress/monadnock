<h1>The Monument of Giordano Bruno</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne (1889)</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
Not from without us, only from within,<br/>
Comes or can ever come upon us light<br/>
Whereby the soul keeps ever truth in sight.<br/>
No truth, no strength, no comfort man may win,<br/>
No grace for guidance, no release from sin,<br/>
Save of his own soul's giving. Deep and bright<br/>
As fire enkindled in the core of night<br/>
Burns in the soul where once its fire has been<br/>
The light that leads and quickens thought, inspired<br/>
To doubt and trust and conquer. So he said<br/>
Whom Sidney, flower of England, lordliest head<br/>
Of all we love, loved: but the fates required<br/>
A sacrifice to hate and hell, ere fame<br/>
Should set with his in heaven Giordano's name.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
Cover thine eyes and weep, O child of hell,<br/>
Grey spouse of Satan, Church of name abhorred.<br/>
Weep, withered harlot, with thy weeping lord,<br/>
Now none will buy the heaven thou hast to sell<br/>
At price of prostituted souls, and swell<br/>
Thy loveless list of lovers. Fire and sword<br/>
No more are thine: the steel, the wheel, the cord,<br/>
The flames that rose round living limbs, and fell<br/>
In lifeless ash and ember, now no more<br/>
Approve thee godlike. Rome, redeemed at last<br/>
From all the red pollution of thy past,<br/>
Acclaims the grave bright face that smiled of yore<br/>
Even on the fire that caught it round and clomb<br/>
To cast its ashes on the face of Rome.
</p>
<p>June 9, 1889.</p>

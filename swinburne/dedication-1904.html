<h1>Dedication</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
The sea that is life everlasting<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And death everlasting as life<br/>
Abides not a pilot's forecasting,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Foretells not of peace or of strife.<br/>
The might of the night that was hidden<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Arises and darkens the day,<br/>
A glory rebuked and forbidden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Time's crown, and his prey.
</p>
<p>
No sweeter, no kindlier, no fairer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No lovelier a soul from its birth<br/>
Wore ever a brighter and rarer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Life's raiment for life upon earth<br/>
Than his who enkindled and cherished<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Art's vestal and luminous flame,<br/>
That dies not when kingdoms have perished<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In storm or in shame.
</p>
<p>
No braver, no trustier, no purer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No stronger and clearer a soul<br/>
Bore witness more splendid and surer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For manhood found perfect and whole<br/>
Since man was a warrior and dreamer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than his who in hatred of wrong<br/>
Would fain have arisen a redeemer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By sword or by song.
</p>
<p>
Twin brethren in spirit, immortal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As art and as love, which were one<br/>
For you from the birthday whose portal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;First gave you to sight of the sun,<br/>
To-day nor to-night nor to-morrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May bring you again from above,<br/>
Drawn down by the spell of the sorrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose anguish is love.
</p>
<p>
No light rearising hereafter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall lighten us here as of old<br/>
When seasons were lustrous as laughter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of waves that are snowshine and gold.<br/>
The dawn that imbues and enkindles<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Life's fluctuant and fugitive sea<br/>
Dies down as the starshine that dwindles<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And cares not to be.
</p>
<p>
Men, mightier than death which divides us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends, dearer than sorrow can say,<br/>
The light that is darkness and hides us<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Awhile from each other away<br/>
Abides but awhile and endures not,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We know, though the day be as night,<br/>
For souls that forgetfulness lures not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till sleep be in sight.
</p>
<p>
The sleep that enfolds you, the slumber<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Supreme and eternal on earth,<br/>
Whence ages of numberless number<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall bring us not back into birth,<br/>
We know not indeed if it be not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What no man hath known if it be,<br/>
Life, quickened with light that we see not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If spirits may see.
</p>
<p>
The love that would see and would know it<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is even as the love of a child.<br/>
But the fire of the fame of the poet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who gazed on the past, and it smiled,<br/>
But the light of the fame of the painter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose hand was as morning's in May,<br/>
Death bids not be darker or fainter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Time casts not away.
</p>
<p>
We, left of them loveless and lonely,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who lived in the light of their love,<br/>
Whose darkness desires it, we only,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who see them afar and above,<br/>
So far, if we die not, above us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So lately no dearer than near,<br/>
May know not of death if they love us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of night if they hear.
</p>
<p>
We, stricken and darkling and living,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who loved them and love them, abide<br/>
A day, and the gift of its giving,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour, and the turn of its tide,<br/>
When twilight and midnight and morrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall pass from the sight of the sun,<br/>
And death be forgotten, and sorrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Discrowned and undone.
</p>
<p>
For us as for these will the breathless<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Brief minute arise and pass by:<br/>
And if death be not utterly deathless,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If love do not utterly die,<br/>
From the life that is quenched as an ember<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul that aspires as a flame<br/>
Can choose not but wholly remember<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love, lovelier than fame.
</p>
<p>
Though sure be the seal of their glory<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fairer no fame upon earth,<br/>
Though never a leaf shall grow hoary<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the crowns that were given them at birth,<br/>
While time as a vassal doth duty<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To names that he towers not above,<br/>
More perfect in price and in beauty<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever is love.
</p>
<p>
The night is upon us, and anguish<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of longing that yearns for the dead.<br/>
But mourners that faint not or languish,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That veil not and bow not the head,<br/>
Take comfort to heart if a token<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be given them of comfort to be:<br/>
While darkness on earth is unbroken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Light lives on the sea.

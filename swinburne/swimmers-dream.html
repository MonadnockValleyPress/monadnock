<h1>A Swimmer's Dream</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>November 4, 1889.</h3>
<blockquote><em>Somno mollior unda</em></blockquotep>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
Dawn is dim on the dark soft water,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft and passionate, dark and sweet.<br/>
Love's own self was the deep sea's daughter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair and flawless from face to feet,<br/>
Hailed of all when the world was golden,<br/>
Loved of lovers whose names beholden<br/>
Thrill men's eyes as with light of olden<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Days more glad than their flight was fleet.
</p>
<p>
So they sang: but for men that love her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Souls that hear not her word in vain,<br/>
Earth beside her and heaven above her<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seem but shadows that wax and wane.<br/>
Softer than sleep's are the sea's caresses,<br/>
Kinder than love's that betrays and blesses,<br/>
Blither than spring's when her flowerful tresses<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shake forth sunlight and shine with rain.
</p>
<p>
All the strength of the waves that perish<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Swells beneath me and laughs and sighs,<br/>
Sighs for love of the life they cherish,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughs to know that it lives and dies,<br/>
Dies for joy of its life, and lives<br/>
Thrilled with joy that its brief death gives&mdash;<br/>
Death whose laugh or whose breath forgives<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Change that bids it subside and rise.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
Hard and heavy, remote but nearing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunless hangs the severe sky's weight,<br/>
Cloud on cloud, though the wind be veering<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaped on high to the sundawn's gate.<br/>
Dawn and even and noon are one,<br/>
Veiled with vapour and void of sun;<br/>
Nought in sight or in fancied hearing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now less mighty than time or fate.
</p>
<p>
The grey sky gleams and the grey seas glimmer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale and sweet as a dream's delight,<br/>
As a dream's where darkness and light seem dimmer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched by dawn or subdued by night.<br/>
The dark wind, stern and sublime and sad,<br/>
Swings the rollers to westward, clad<br/>
With lustrous shadow that lures the swimmer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lures and lulls him with dreams of light.
</p>
<p>
Light, and sleep, and delight, and wonder,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Change, and rest, and a charm of cloud,<br/>
Fill the world of the skies whereunder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaves and quivers and pants aloud<br/>
All the world of the waters, hoary<br/>
Now, but clothed with its own live glory,<br/>
That mates the lightning and mocks the thunder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With light more living and word more proud.
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
Far off westward, whither sets the sounding strife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Strife more sweet than peace, of shoreless waves whose glee<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scorns the shore and loves the wind that leaves them free,<br/>
Strange as sleep and pale as death and fair as life,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shifts the moonlight-coloured sunshine on the sea.
</p>
<p>
Toward the sunset's goal the sunless waters crowd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast as autumn days toward winter: yet it seems<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here that autumn wanes not, here that woods and streams<br/>
Lose not heart and change not likeness, chilled and bowed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Warped and wrinkled: here the days are fair as dreams.
</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>
O russet-robed November,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What ails thee so to smile?<br/>
Chill August, pale September,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Endured a woful while,<br/>
And fell as falls an ember<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From forth a flameless pile:<br/>
But golden-girt November<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bids all she looks on smile.
</p>
<p>
The lustrous foliage, waning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As wanes the morning moon,<br/>
Here falling, here refraining,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Outbraves the pride of June<br/>
With statelier semblance, feigning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No fear lest death be soon:<br/>
As though the woods thus waning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should wax to meet the moon.
</p>
<p>
As though, when fields lie stricken<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By grey December's breath,<br/>
These lordlier growths that sicken<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And die for fear of death<br/>
Should feel the sense requicken<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That hears what springtide saith<br/>
And thrills for love, spring-stricken<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And pierced with April's breath.
</p>
<p>
The keen white-winged north-easter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That stings and spurs thy sea<br/>
Doth yet but feed and feast her<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With glowing sense of glee:<br/>
Calm chained her, storm released her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And storm's glad voice was he:<br/>
South-wester or north-easter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy winds rejoice the sea.
</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>
A dream, a dream is it all&mdash;the season,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky, the water, the wind, the shore?<br/>
A day-born dream of divine unreason,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A marvel moulded of sleep&mdash;no more?<br/>
For the cloudlike wave that my limbs while cleaving<br/>
Feel as in slumber beneath them heaving<br/>
Soothes the sense as to slumber, leaving<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sense of nought that was known of yore.
</p>
<p>
A purer passion, a lordlier leisure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A peace more happy than lives on land,<br/>
Fulfils with pulse of diviner pleasure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreaming head and the steering hand.<br/>
I lean my cheek to the cold grey pillow,<br/>
The deep soft swell of the full broad billow,<br/>
And close mine eyes for delight past measure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wish the wheel of the world would stand.
</p>
<p>
The wild-winged hour that we fain would capture<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Falls as from heaven that its light feet clomb,<br/>
So brief, so soft, and so full the rapture<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was felt that soothed me with sense of home.<br/>
To sleep, to swim, and to dream, for ever&mdash;<br/>
Such joy the vision of man saw never;<br/>
For here too soon will a dark day sever<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea-bird's wing from the sea-wave's foam.
</p>
<p>
A dream, and more than a dream, and dimmer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At once and brighter than dreams that flee,<br/>
The moment's joy of the seaward swimmer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Abides, remembered as truth may be.<br/>
Not all the joy and not all the glory<br/>
Must fade as leaves when the woods wax hoary;<br/>
For there the downs and the sea-banks glimmer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And here to south of them swells the sea.

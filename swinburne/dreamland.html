<h1>A Ballad of Dreamland</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
I hid my heart in a nest of roses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the sun's way, hidden apart;<br/>
In a softer bed than the soft white snow's is,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the roses I hid my heart.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would it sleep not? why should it start,<br/>
When never a leaf of the rose-tree stirred?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What made sleep flutter his wings and part?<br/>
Only the song of a secret bird.
</p>
<p>
Lie still, I said, for the wind's wing closes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mild leaves muffle the keen sun's dart;<br/>
Lie still, for the wind on the warm sea dozes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wind is unquieter yet than thou art.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does a thought in thee still as a thorn's wound smart?<br/>
Does the fang still fret thee of hope deferred?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What bids the lids of thy sleep dispart?<br/>
Only the song of a secret bird.
</p>
<p>
The green land's name that a charm encloses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It never was writ in the traveller's chart,<br/>
And sweet on its trees as the fruit that grows is,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It never was sold in the merchant's mart.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swallows of dreams through its dim fields dart,<br/>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 86]</span>And sleep's are the tunes in its tree-tops heard;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No hound's note wakens the wildwood hart,<br/>
Only the song of a secret bird.
</p>
<h3>ENVOI</h3>
<p>
In the world of dreams I have chosen my part,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sleep for a season and hear no word<br/>
Of true love's truth or of light love's art,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the song of a secret bird.

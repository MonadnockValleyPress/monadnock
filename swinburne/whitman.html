<h1>To Walt Whitman in America</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
Send but a song oversea for us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart of their hearts who are free,<br/>
Heart of their singer, to be for us<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More than our singing can be;<br/>
Ours, in the tempest at error,<br/>
With no light but the twilight of terror;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Send us a song oversea!
</p>
<p>
Sweet-smelling of pine-leaves and grasses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And blown as a tree through and through<br/>
With the winds of the keen mountain-passes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tender as sun-smitten dew;<br/>
Sharp-tongued as the winter that shakes<br/>
The wastes of your limitless lakes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wide-eyed as the sea-line's blue.
</p>
<p>
O strong-winged soul with prophetic<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lips hot with the bloodheats of song,<br/>
With tremor of heartstrings magnetic,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With thoughts as thunders in throng,<br/>
With consonant ardours of chords<br/>
That pierce men's souls as with swords<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hale them hearing along,
</p>
<p>
Make us too music, to be with us<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As a word from a world's heart warm,<br/>
To sail the dark as a sea with us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-sailed, outsinging the storm,<br/>
A song to put fire in our ears<br/>
Whose burning shall burn up tears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose sign bid battle reform;
</p>
<p>
A note in the ranks of a clarion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A word in the wind of cheer,<br/>
To consume as with lightning the carrion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That makes time foul for us here;<br/>
In the air that our dead things infest<br/>
A blast of the breath of the west,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till east way as west way is clear.
</p>
<p>
Out of the sun beyond sunset,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the evening whence morning shall be,<br/>
With the rollers in measureless onset,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the van of the storming sea,<br/>
With the world-wide wind, with the breath<br/>
That breaks ships driven upon death,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passion of all things free,
</p>
<p>
With the sea-steeds footless and frantic,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;White myriads for death to bestride<br/>
In the charge of the ruining Atlantic<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where deaths by regiments ride,<br/>
With clouds and clamours of waters,<br/>
With a long note shriller than slaughter's<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the furrowless fields world-wide,
</p>
<p>
With terror, with ardour and wonder,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the soul of the season that wakes<br/>
When the weight of a whole year's thunder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the tidestream of autumn breaks,<br/>
Let the flight of the wide-winged word<br/>
Come over, come in and be heard,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Take form and fire for our sakes.
</p>
<p>
For a continent bloodless with travail<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here toils and brawls as it can,<br/>
And the web of it who shall unravel<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all that peer on the plan;<br/>
Would fain grow men, but they grow not,<br/>
And fain be free, but they know not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One name for freedom and man?
</p>
<p>
One name, not twain for division;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing, not twain, from the birth;<br/>
Spirit and substance and vision,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Worth more than worship is worth;<br/>
Unbeheld, unadored, undivined,<br/>
The cause, the centre, the mind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret and sense of the earth.
</p>
<p>
Here as a weakling in irons,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here as a weanling in bands,<br/>
As a prey that the stake-net environs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our life that we looked for stands;<br/>
And the man-child naked and dear,<br/>
Democracy, turns on us here<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes trembling with tremulous hands
</p>
<p>
It sees not what season shall bring to it<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet fruit of its bitter desire;<br/>
Few voices it hears yet sing to it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Few pulses of hearts reaspire;<br/>
Foresees not time, nor forehears<br/>
The noises of imminent years,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Earthquake, and thunder, and fire:
</p>
<p>
When crowned and weaponed and curbless<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall walk without helm or shield<br/>
The bare burnt furrows and herbless<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of war's last flame-stricken field,<br/>
Till godlike, equal with time,<br/>
It stand in the sun sublime,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the godhead of man revealed.
</p>
<p>
Round your people and over them<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Light like raiment is drawn,<br/>
Close as a garment to cover them<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrought not of mail nor of lawn;<br/>
Here, with hope hardly to wear,<br/>
Naked nations and bare<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Swim, sink, strike out for the dawn.
</p>
<p>
Chains are here, and a prison,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kings, and subjects, and shame;<br/>
If the God upon you be arisen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How should our songs be the same?<br/>
How, in confusion of change,<br/>
How shall we sing, in a strange<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Land, songs praising his name?
</p>
<p>
God is buried and dead to us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the spirit of earth,<br/>
Freedom; so have they said to us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some with mocking and mirth,<br/>
Some with heartbreak and tears;<br/>
And a God without eyes, without ears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shall sing of him, dead in the birth?
</p>
<p>
The earth-god Freedom, the lonely<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Face lightening, the footprint unshod,<br/>
Not as one man crucified only<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor scourged with but one life's rod;<br/>
The soul that is substance of nations,<br/>
Reincarnate with fresh generations;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The great god Man, which is God.
</p>
<p>
But in weariest of years and obscurest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth it live not at heart of all things,<br/>
The one God and one spirit, a purest<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Life, fed from unstanchable springs?<br/>
Within love, within hatred it is,<br/>
And its seed in the stripe as the kiss,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And in slaves is the germ, and in kings.
</p>
<p>
Freedom we call it, for holier<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Name of the soul's there is none;<br/>
Surelier it labours if slowlier,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the metres of star or of sun;<br/>
Slowlier than life into breath,<br/>
Surelier than time into death,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It moves till its labour be done.
</p>
<p>
Till the motion be done and the measure<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Circling through season and clime,<br/>
Slumber and sorrow and pleasure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision of virtue and crime;<br/>
Till consummate with conquering eyes,<br/>
A soul disembodied, it rise<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the body transfigured of time.
</p>
<p>
Till it rise and remain and take station<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the stars of the worlds that rejoice;<br/>
Till the voice of its heart's exultation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be as theirs an invariable voice;<br/>
By no discord of evil estranged,<br/>
By no pause, by no breach in it changed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By no clash in the chord of its choice.
</p>
<p>
It is one with the world's generations,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the spirit, the star, and the sod;<br/>
With the kingless and king-stricken nations,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the cross, and the chain, and the rod;<br/>
The most high, the most secret, most lonely,<br/>
The earth-soul Freedom, that only<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives, and that only is God.

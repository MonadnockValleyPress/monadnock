<h1>By the North Sea</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
<p>(To a friend leaving England for a year's residence in Australia.)</p>
<blockquote>
  "We are what suns and winds and waters make us."
  <br/><br/>
  &mdash;Landor
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<blockquote>
<em>Sea, wind, and sun, with light and sound and breath<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of man fulfilling&mdash;these create<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That joy wherewith man's life grown passionate<br/>
Gains heart to hear and sense to read and faith<br/>
To know the secret word our Mother saith<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, and to see, though doubt wax great,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death as the shadow cast by life on fate,<br/>
Passing, whose shade we call the shadow of death.
<br/><br/>
Brother, to whom our Mother as to me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is dearer than all dreams of days undone,<br/>
This song I give you of the sovereign three<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That are as life and sleep and death are, one:<br/>
A song the sea-wind gave me from the sea,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where nought of man's endures before the sun.</em>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<h4>1.</h4>
<p>
A land that is lonelier than ruin;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sea that is stranger than death:<br/>
Far fields that a rose never blew in,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wan waste where the winds lack breath;<br/>
Waste endless and boundless and flowerless<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But of marsh-blossoms fruitless as free:<br/>
Where earth lies exhausted, as powerless<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strive with the sea.
</p>
<h4>2.</h4>
<p>
Far flickers the flight of the swallows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far flutters the weft of the grass<br/>
Spun dense over desolate hollows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More pale than the clouds as they pass:<br/>
Thick woven as the weft of a witch is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the heart of a thrall that hath sinned,<br/>
Whose youth and the wrecks of its riches<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are waifs on the wind.
</p>
<h4>3.</h4>
<p>
The pastures are herdless and sheepless,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No pasture or shelter for herds:<br/>
The wind is relentless and sleepless,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And restless and songless the birds;<br/>
Their cries from afar fall breathless,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their wings are as lightnings that flee;<br/>
For the land has two lords that are deathless:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death's self, and the sea.
</p>
<h4>4.</h4>
<p>
These twain, as a king with his fellow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold converse of desolate speech:<br/>
And her waters are haggard and yellow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crass with the scurf of the beach:<br/>
And his garments are grey as the hoary<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wan sky where the day lies dim;<br/>
And his power is to her, and his glory,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hers unto him.
</p>
<h4>5.</h4>
<p>
In the pride of his power she rejoices,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her glory he glows and is glad:<br/>
In her darkness the sound of his voice is,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his breath she dilates and is mad:<br/>
"If thou slay me, O death, and outlive me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet thy love hath fulfilled me of thee."<br/>
"Shall I give thee not back if thou give me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O sister, O sea?"
</p>
<h4>6.</h4>
<p>
And year upon year dawns living,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And age upon age drops dead:<br/>
And his hand is not weary of giving,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the thirst of her heart is not fed:<br/>
And the hunger that moans in her passion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rage in her hunger that roars,<br/>
As a wolf's that the winter lays lash on,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still calls and implores.
</p>
<h4>7.</h4>
<p>
Her walls have no granite for girder,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No fortalice fronting her stands:<br/>
But reefs the bloodguiltiest of murder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are less than the banks of her sands:<br/>
These number their slain by the thousand;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the ship hath no surety to be,<br/>
When the bank is abreast of her bows and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aflush with the sea.
</p>
<h4>8.</h4>
<p>
No surety to stand, and no shelter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dawn out of darkness but one,<br/>
Out of waters that hurtle and welter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No succour to dawn with the sun,<br/>
But a rest from the wind as it passes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, hardly redeemed from the waves,<br/>
Lie thick as the blades of the grasses<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead in their graves.
</p>
<h4>9.</h4>
<p>
A multitude noteless of numbers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As wild weeds cast on an heap:<br/>
And sounder than sleep are their slumbers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And softer than song is their sleep;<br/>
And sweeter than all things and stranger<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense, if perchance it may be,<br/>
That the wind is divested of danger<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scatheless the sea.
</p>
<h4>10.</h4>
<p>
That the roar of the banks they breasted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is hurtless as bellowing of herds,<br/>
And the strength of his wings that invested<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind, as the strength of a bird's;<br/>
As the sea-mew's might or the swallow's<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That cry to him back if he cries,<br/>
As over the graves and their hollows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days darken and rise.
</p>
<h4>11.</h4>
<p>
As the souls of the dead men disburdened<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clean of the sins that they sinned,<br/>
With a lovelier than man's life guerdoned<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And delight as a wave's in the wind,<br/>
And delight as the wind's in the billow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birds pass, and deride with their glee<br/>
The flesh that has dust for its pillow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As wrecks have the sea.
</p>
<h4>12.</h4>
<p>
When the ways of the sun wax dimmer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wings flash through the dusk like beams;<br/>
As the clouds in the lit sky glimmer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird in the graveyard gleams;<br/>
As the cloud at its wing's edge whitens<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the clarions of sunrise are heard,<br/>
The graves that the bird's note brightens<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grow bright for the bird.
</p>
<h4>13.</h4>
<p>
As the waves of the numberless waters<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the wind cannot number who guides<br/>
Are the sons of the shore and the daughters<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here lulled by the chime of the tides:<br/>
And here in the press of them standing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know not if these or if we<br/>
Live truliest, or anchored to landing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or drifted to sea.
</p>
<h4>14.</h4>
<p>
In the valley he named of decision<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No denser were multitudes met<br/>
When the soul of the seer in her vision<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw nations for doom of them set;<br/>
Saw darkness in dawn, and the splendour<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of judgment, the sword and the rod;<br/>
But the doom here of death is more tender<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gentler the god.
</p>
<h4>15.</h4>
<p>
And gentler the wind from the dreary<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea-banks by the waves overlapped,<br/>
Being weary, speaks peace to the weary<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From slopes that the tide-stream hath sapped;<br/>
And sweeter than all that we call so<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seal of their slumber shall be<br/>
Till the graves that embosom them also<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sapped of the sea.
</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<h4>1.</h4>
<p>
For the heart of the waters is cruel,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the kisses are dire of their lips,<br/>
And their waves are as fire is to fuel<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the strength of the sea-faring ships,<br/>
Though the sea's eye gleam as a jewel<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sun's eye back as he dips.
</p>
<h4>2.</h4>
<p>
Though the sun's eye flash to the sea's<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live light of delight and of laughter,<br/>
And her lips breathe back to the breeze<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kiss that the wind's lips waft her<br/>
From the sun that subsides, and sees<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No gleam of the storm's dawn after.
</p>
<h4>3.</h4>
<p>
And the wastes of the wild sea-marches<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the borderers are matched in their might&mdash;<br/>
Bleak fens that the sun's weight parches,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dense waves that reject his light&mdash;<br/>
Change under the change-coloured arches<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of changeless morning and night.
</p>
<h4>4.</h4>
<p>
The waves are as ranks enrolled<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too close for the storm to sever:<br/>
The fens lie naked and cold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their heart fails utterly never:<br/>
The lists are set from of old,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the warfare endureth for ever.
</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<h4>1.</h4>
<p>
Miles, and miles, and miles of desolation!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leagues on leagues on leagues without a change!<br/>
Sign or token of some eldest nation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here would make the strange land not so strange.<br/>
Time-forgotten, yea since time's creation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seem these borders where the sea-birds range.
</p>
<h4>2.</h4>
<p>
Slowly, gladly, full of peace and wonder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grows his heart who journeys here alone.<br/>
Earth and all its thoughts of earth sink under<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep as deep in water sinks a stone.<br/>
Hardly knows it if the rollers thunder,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly whence the lonely wind is blown.
</p>
<h4>3.</h4>
<p>
Tall the plumage of the rush-flower tosses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp and soft in many a curve and line<br/>
Gleam and glow the sea-coloured marsh-mosses<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salt and splendid from the circling brine.<br/>
Streak on streak of glimmering seashine crosses<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the land sea-saturate as with wine.
</p>
<h4>4.</h4>
<p>
Far, and far between, in divers orders,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear grey steeples cleave the low grey sky;<br/>
Fast and firm as time-unshaken warders,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearts made sure by faith, by hope made high.<br/>
These alone in all the wild sea-borders<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear no blast of days and nights that die.
</p>
<h4>5.</h4>
<p>
All the land is like as one man's face is,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale and troubled still with change of cares.<br/>
Doubt and death pervade her clouded spaces:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strength and length of life and peace are theirs;<br/>
Theirs alone amid these weary places,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing not how the wild world frets and fares.
</p>
<h4>6.</h4>
<p>
Firm and fast where all is cloud that changes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloud-clogged sunlight, cloud by sunlight thinned,<br/>
Stern and sweet, above the sand-hill ranges<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch the towers and tombs of men that sinned<br/>
Once, now calm as earth whose only change is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind, and light, and wind, and cloud, and wind.
</p>
<h4>7.</h4>
<p>
Out and in and out the sharp straits wander,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In and out and in the wild way strives,<br/>
Starred and paved and lined with flowers that squander<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold as golden as the gold of hives,<br/>
Salt and moist and multiform: but yonder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, what sign of life or death survives?
</p>
<h4>8.</h4>
<p>
Seen then only when the songs of olden<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harps were young whose echoes yet endure,<br/>
Hymned of Homer when his years were golden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Known of only when the world was pure,<br/>
Here is Hades, manifest, beholden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, surely here, if aught be sure!
</p>
<h4>9.</h4>
<p>
Where the border-line was crossed, that, sundering<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death from life, keeps weariness from rest,<br/>
None can tell, who fares here forward wondering;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None may doubt but here might end his quest.<br/>
Here life's lightning joys and woes once thundering<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea-like round him cease like storm suppressed.
</p>
<h4>10.</h4>
<p>
Here the wise wave-wandering steadfast-hearted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guest of many a lord of many a land<br/>
Saw the shape or shade of years departed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the semblance risen and hard at hand,<br/>
Saw the mother long from love's reach parted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anticleia, like a statue stand.
</p>
<h4>11.</h4>
<p>
Statue? nay, nor tissued image woven<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair on hangings in his father's hall;<br/>
Nay, too fast her faith of heart was proven,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far too firm her loveliest love of all;<br/>
Love wherethrough the loving heart was cloven,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love that hears not when the loud Fates call.
</p>
<h4>12.</h4>
<p>
Love that lives and stands up re-created<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then when life has ebbed and anguish fled;<br/>
Love more strong than death or all things fated,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child's and mother's, lit by love and led;<br/>
Love that found what life so long awaited<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, when life came down among the dead.
</p>
<h4>13.</h4>
<p>
Here, where never came alive another,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came her son across the sundering tide<br/>
Crossed before by many a warrior brother<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once that warred on Ilion at his side;<br/>
Here spread forth vain hands to clasp the mother<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead, that sorrowing for his love's sake died.
</p>
<h4>14.</h4>
<p>
Parted, though by narrowest of divisions,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clasp he might not, only might implore,<br/>
Sundered yet by bitterest of derisions,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son, and mother from the son she bore&mdash;<br/>
Here? But all dispeopled here of visions<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies, forlorn of shadows even, the shore.
</p>
<h4>15.</h4>
<p>
All too sweet such men's Hellenic speech is,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All too fain they lived of light to see,<br/>
Once to see the darkness of these beaches,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once to sing this Hades found of me<br/>
Ghostless, all its gulfs and creeks and reaches,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sky, and shore, and cloud, and waste, and sea.
</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<h4>1.</h4>
<p>
But aloft and afront of me faring<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far forward as folk in a dream<br/>
That strive, between doubting and daring,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right on till the goal for them gleam,<br/>
Full forth till their goal on them lighten,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harbour where fain they would be,<br/>
What headlands there darken and brighten?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What change in the sea?
</p>
<h4>2.</h4>
<p>
What houses and woodlands that nestle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe inland to lee of the hill<br/>
As it slopes from the headlands that wrestle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And succumb to the strong sea's will?<br/>
Truce is not, nor respite, nor pity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the battle is waged not of hands<br/>
Where over the grave of a city<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost of it stands.
</p>
<h4>3.</h4>
<p>
Where the wings of the sea-wind slacken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green lawns to the landward thrive,<br/>
Fields brighten and pine-woods blacken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the heat in their heart is alive;<br/>
They blossom and warble and murmur,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sense of their spirit is free:<br/>
But harder to shoreward and firmer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grasp of the sea.
</p>
<h4>4.</h4>
<p>
Like ashes the low cliffs crumble,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banks drop down into dust,<br/>
The heights of the hills are made humble,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a reed's is the strength of their trust:<br/>
As a city's that armies environ,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of their stay is of sand:<br/>
But the grasp of the sea is as iron,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid hard on the land.
</p>
<h4>5.</h4>
<p>
A land that is thirstier than ruin;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sea that is hungrier than death;<br/>
Heaped hills that a tree never grew in;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wide sands where the wave draws breath;<br/>
All solace is here for the spirit<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ever for ever may be<br/>
For the soul of thy son to inherit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother, my sea.
</p>
<h4>6.</h4>
<p>
O delight of the headlands and beaches!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O desire of the wind on the wold,<br/>
More glad than a man's when it reaches<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That end which it sought from of old<br/>
And the palm of possession is dreary<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sense that in search of it sinned;<br/>
But nor satisfied ever nor weary<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is ever the wind.
</p>
<h4>7.</h4>
<p>
The delight that he takes but in living<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is more than of all things that live:<br/>
For the world that has all things for giving<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has nothing so goodly to give:<br/>
But more than delight his desire is,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the goal where his pinions would be<br/>
Is immortal as air or as fire is,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immense as the sea.
</p>
<h4>8.</h4>
<p>
Though hence come the moan that he borrows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From darkness and depth of the night,<br/>
Though hence be the spring of his sorrows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence too is the joy of his might;<br/>
The delight that his doom is for ever<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To seek and desire and rejoice,<br/>
And the sense that eternity never<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall silence his voice.
</p>
<h4>9.</h4>
<p>
That satiety never may stifle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor weariness ever estrange<br/>
Nor time be so strong as to rifle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor change be so great as to change<br/>
His gift that renews in the giving,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joy that exalts him to be<br/>
Alone of all elements living<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord of the sea.
</p>
<h4>10.</h4>
<p>
What is fire, that its flame should consume her?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More fierce than all fires are her waves:<br/>
What is earth, that its gulfs should entomb her?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More deep are her own than their graves.<br/>
Life shrinks from his pinions that cover<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness by thunders bedinned:<br/>
But she knows him, her lord and her lover<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The godhead of wind.
</p>
<h4>11.</h4>
<p>
For a season his wings are about her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His breath on her lips for a space;<br/>
Such rapture he wins not without her<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the width of his worldwide race.<br/>
Though the forests bow down, and the mountains<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wax dark, and the tribes of them flee,<br/>
His delight is more deep in the fountains<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And springs of the sea.
</p>
<h4>12.</h4>
<p>
There are those too of mortals that love him,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are souls that desire and require,<br/>
Be the glories of midnight above him<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or beneath him the daysprings of fire:<br/>
And their hearts are as harps that approve him<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And praise him as chords of a lyre<br/>
That were fain with their music to move him<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet their desire
</p>
<h4>13.</h4>
<p>
To descend through the darkness to grace them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till darkness were lovelier than light:<br/>
To encompass and grasp and embrace them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till their weakness were one with his might:<br/>
With the strength of his wings to caress them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the blast of his breath to set free;<br/>
With the mouths of his thunders to bless them<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sons of the sea.
</p>
<h4>14.</h4>
<p>
For these have the toil and the guerdon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the wind has eternally: these<br/>
Have part in the boon and the burden<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sleepless unsatisfied breeze,<br/>
That finds not, but seeking rejoices<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That possession can work him no wrong:<br/>
And the voice at the heart of their voice is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of his song.
</p>
<h4>15.</h4>
<p>
For the wind's is their doom and their blessing;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To desire, and have always above<br/>
A possession beyond their possessing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A love beyond reach of their love.<br/>
Green earth has her sons and her daughters,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these have their guerdons; but we<br/>
Are the wind's and the sun's and the water's,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elect of the sea.
</p>
<h3>V.</h3>
<h4>1.</h4>
<p>
For the sea too seeks and rejoices,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gains and loses and gains,<br/>
And the joy of her heart's own choice is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ours, and as ours are her pains:<br/>
As the thoughts of our hearts are her voices,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as hers is the pulse of our veins.
</p>
<h4>2.</h4>
<p>
Her fields that know not of dearth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor lie for their fruit's sake fallow<br/>
Laugh large in the depth of their mirth:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But inshore here in the shallow,<br/>
Embroiled with encumbrance of earth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their skirts are turbid and yellow.
</p>
<h4>3.</h4>
<p>
The grime of her greed is upon her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sign of her deed is her soil;<br/>
As the earth's is her own dishonour,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And corruption the crown of her toil:<br/>
She hath spoiled and devoured, and her honour<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this, to be shamed by her spoil.
</p>
<h4>4.</h4>
<p>
But afar where pollution is none,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor ensign of strife nor endeavour,<br/>
Where her heart and the sun's are one,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the soil of her sin comes never,<br/>
She is pure as the wind and the sun,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her sweetness endureth for ever.
</p>
<h3>VI.</h3>
<h4>1.</h4>
<p>
Death, and change, and darkness everlasting,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deaf, that hears not what the daystar saith,<br/>
Blind, past all remembrance and forecasting,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead, past memory that it once drew breath;<br/>
These, above the washing tides and wasting,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reign, and rule this land of utter death.
</p>
<h4>2.</h4>
<p>
Change of change, darkness of darkness, hidden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very death of very death, begun<br/>
When none knows,&mdash;the knowledge is forbidden&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-begotten, self-proceeding, one,<br/>
Born, not made&mdash;abhorred, unchained, unchidden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night stands here defiant of the sun.
</p>
<h4>3.</h4>
<p>
Change of change, and death of death begotten,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkness born of darkness, one and three,<br/>
Ghostly godhead of a world forgotten,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowned with heaven, enthroned on land and sea,<br/>
Here, where earth with dead men's bones is rotten,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God of Time, thy likeness worships thee.
</p>
<h4>4.</h4>
<p>
Lo, thy likeness of thy desolation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shape and figure of thy might, O Lord,<br/>
Formless form, incarnate miscreation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Served of all things living and abhorred;<br/>
Earth herself is here thine incarnation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time, of all things born on earth adored.
</p>
<h4>5.</h4>
<p>
All that worship thee are fearful of thee;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No man may not worship thee for fear:<br/>
Prayers nor curses prove not nor disprove thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Move nor change thee with our change of cheer:<br/>
All at last, though all abhorred thee, love thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, the sceptre of whose throne is here.
</p>
<h4>6.</h4>
<p>
Here thy throne and sceptre of thy station,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the palace paven for thy feet;<br/>
Here thy sign from nation unto nation<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed as watchword for thy guards to greet,<br/>
Guards that go before thine exaltation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ages, clothed with bitter years and sweet.
</p>
<h4>7.</h4>
<p>
Here, where sharp the sea-bird shrills his ditty,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flickering flame-wise through the clear live calm,<br/>
Rose triumphal, crowning all a city,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roofs exalted once with prayer and psalm,<br/>
Built of holy hands for holy pity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank and fruitful as a sheltering palm.
</p>
<h4>8.</h4>
<p>
Church and hospice wrought in faultless fashion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hall and chancel bounteous and sublime,<br/>
Wide and sweet and glorious as compassion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filled and thrilled with force of choral chime,<br/>
Filled with spirit of prayer and thrilled with passion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hailed a God more merciful than Time.
</p>
<h4>9.</h4>
<p>
Ah, less mighty, less than Time prevailing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrunk, expelled, made nothing at his nod,<br/>
Less than clouds across the sea-line sailing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies he, stricken by his master's rod.<br/>
"Where is man?" the cloister murmurs wailing;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back the mute shrine thunders&mdash;"Where is God?"
</p>
<h4>10.</h4>
<p>
Here is all the end of all his glory&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dust, and grass, and barren silent stones.<br/>
Dead, like him, one hollow tower and hoary<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naked in the sea-wind stands and moans,<br/>
Filled and thrilled with its perpetual story:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, where earth is dense with dead men's bones.
</p>
<h4>11.</h4>
<p>
Low and loud and long, a voice for ever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds the wind's clear story like a song.<br/>
Tomb from tomb the waves devouring sever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dust from dust as years relapse along;<br/>
Graves where men made sure to rest, and never<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie dismantled by the seasons' wrong.
</p>
<h4>12.</h4>
<p>
Now displaced, devoured and desecrated,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now by Time's hands darkly disinterred,<br/>
These poor dead that sleeping here awaited<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long the archangel's re-creating word,<br/>
Closed about with roofs and walls high-gated<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the blast of judgment should be heard,
</p>
<h4>13.</h4>
<p>
Naked, shamed, cast out of consecration,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corpse and coffin, yea the very graves,<br/>
Scoffed at, scattered, shaken from their station,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spurned and scourged of wind and sea like slaves,<br/>
Desolate beyond man's desolation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrink and sink into the waste of waves.
</p>
<h4>14.</h4>
<p>
Tombs, with bare white piteous bones protruded,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shroudless, down the loose collapsing banks,<br/>
Crumble, from their constant place detruded,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sea devours and gives not thanks.<br/>
Graves where hope and prayer and sorrow brooded<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gape and slide and perish, ranks on ranks.
</p>
<h4>15.</h4>
<p>
Rows on rows and line by line they crumble,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They that thought for all time through to be.<br/>
Scarce a stone whereon a child might stumble<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaks the grim field paced alone of me.<br/>
Earth, and man, and all their gods wax humble<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, where Time brings pasture to the sea.
</p>
<h3>VII.</h3>
<h4>1.</h4>
<p>
But afar on the headland exalted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But beyond in the curl of the bay,<br/>
From the depth of his dome deep-vaulted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our father is lord of the day.<br/>
Our father and lord that we follow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For deathless and ageless is he;<br/>
And his robe is the whole sky's hollow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sandal the sea.
</p>
<h4>2.</h4>
<p>
Where the horn of the headland is sharper,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her green floor glitters with fire,<br/>
The sea has the sun for a harper,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun has the sea for a lyre.<br/>
The waves are a pavement of amber,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the feet of the sea-winds trod<br/>
To receive in a god's presence-chamber<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our father, the God.
</p>
<h4>3.</h4>
<p>
Time, haggard and changeful and hoary,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is master and God of the land:<br/>
But the air is fulfilled of the glory<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is shed from our lord's right hand<br/>
O father of all of us ever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All glory be only to thee<br/>
From heaven, that is void of thee never,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And earth, and the sea.
</p>
<h4>4.</h4>
<p>
O Sun, whereof all is beholden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold now the shadow of this death,<br/>
This place of the sepulchres, olden<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And emptied and vain as a breath.<br/>
The bloom of the bountiful heather<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughs broadly beyond in thy light<br/>
As dawn, with her glories to gather,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At darkness and night.
</p>
<h4>5.</h4>
<p>
Though the Gods of the night lie rotten<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their honour be taken away<br/>
And the noise of their names forgotten,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou, Lord, art God of the day.<br/>
Thou art father and saviour and spirit,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Sun, of the soul that is free<br/>
And hath grace of thy grace to inherit<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine earth and thy sea.
</p>
<h4>6.</h4>
<p>
The hills and the sands and the beaches,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waters adrift and afar,<br/>
The banks and the creeks and the reaches,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How glad of thee all these are<br/>
The flowers, overflowing, overcrowded,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are drunk with the mad wind's mirth:<br/>
The delight of thy coming unclouded<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes music of earth.
</p>
<h4>7.</h4>
<p>
I, last least voice of her voices,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give thanks that were mute in me long<br/>
To the soul in my soul that rejoices<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the song that is over my song.<br/>
Time gives what he gains for the giving<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or takes for his tribute of me;<br/>
My dreams to the wind everliving,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My song to the sea.

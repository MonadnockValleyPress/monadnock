<h1>The Garden of Proserpine</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
Here, where the world is quiet;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, where all trouble seems<br/>
Dead winds' and spent waves' riot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In doubtful dreams of dreams;<br/>
I watch the green field growing<br/>
For reaping folk and sowing,<br/>
For harvest-time and mowing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sleepy world of streams.
</p>
<p>
I am tired of tears and laughter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And men that laugh and weep;<br/>
Of what may come hereafter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For men that sow to reap:<br/>
I am weary of days and hours,<br/>
Blown buds of barren flowers,<br/>
Desires and dreams and powers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And everything but sleep.
</p>
<p>
Here life has death for neighbour,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And far from eye or ear<br/>
Wan waves and wet winds labour,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weak ships and spirits steer;<br/>
They drive adrift, and whither<br/>
They wot not who make thither;<br/>
But no such winds blow hither,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no such things grow here.
</p>
<p>
No growth of moor or coppice,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No heather-flower or vine,<br/>
But bloomless buds of poppies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green grapes of Proserpine,<br/>
Pale beds of blowing rushes<br/>
Where no leaf blooms or blushes<br/>
Save this whereout she crushes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For dead men deadly wine.
</p>
<p>
Pale, without name or number,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fruitless fields of corn,<br/>
They bow themselves and slumber<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All night till light is born;<br/>
And like a soul belated,<br/>
In hell and heaven unmated,<br/>
By cloud and mist abated<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes out of darkness morn.
</p>
<p>
Though one were strong as seven,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He too with death shall dwell,<br/>
Nor wake with wings in heaven,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor weep for pains in hell;<br/>
Though one were fair as roses,<br/>
His beauty clouds and closes;<br/>
And well though love reposes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end it is not well.
</p>
<p>
Pale, beyond porch and portal,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowned with calm leaves, she stands<br/>
Who gathers all things mortal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With cold immortal hands;<br/>
Her languid lips are sweeter<br/>
Than love's who fears to greet her<br/>
To men that mix and meet her<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From many times and lands.
</p>
<p>
She waits for each and other,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waits for all men born;<br/>
Forgets the earth her mother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of fruits and corn;<br/>
And spring and seed and swallow<br/>
Take wing for her and follow<br/>
Where summer song rings hollow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flowers are put to scorn.
</p>
<p>
There go the loves that wither,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old loves with wearier wings;<br/>
And all dead years draw thither,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all disastrous things;<br/>
Dead dreams of days forsaken,<br/>
Blind buds that snows have shaken,<br/>
Wild leaves that winds have taken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red strays of ruined springs.
</p>
<p>
We are not sure of sorrow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And joy was never sure;<br/>
To-day will die to-morrow;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time stoops to no man's lure;<br/>
And love, grown faint and fretful,<br/>
With lips but half regretful<br/>
Sighs, and with eyes forgetful<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeps that no loves endure.
</p>
<p>
From too much love of living,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From hope and fear set free,<br/>
We thank with brief thanksgiving<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever gods may be<br/>
That no life lives for ever;<br/>
That dead men rise up never;<br/>
That even the weariest river<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winds somewhere safe to sea.
</p>
<p>
Then star nor sun shall waken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor any change of light:<br/>
Nor sound of waters shaken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor any sound or sight:<br/>
Nor wintry leaves nor vernal,<br/>
Nor days nor things diurnal;<br/>
Only the sleep eternal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an eternal night.

<h1>August</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
There were four apples on the bough,<br/>
Half gold half red, that one might know<br/>
The blood was ripe inside the core;<br/>
The colour of the leaves was more<br/>
Like stems of yellow corn that grow<br/>
Through all the gold June meadow's floor.
</p>
<p>
The warm smell of the fruit was good<br/>
To feed on, and the split green wood,<br/>
With all its bearded lips and stains<br/>
Of mosses in the cloven veins,<br/>
Most pleasant, if one lay or stood<br/>
In sunshine or in happy rains.
</p>
<p>
There were four apples on the tree,<br/>
Red stained through gold, that all might see<br/>
The sun went warm from core to rind;<br/>
The green leaves made the summer blind<br/>
In that soft place they kept for me<br/>
With golden apples shut behind.
</p>
<p>
The leaves caught gold across the sun,<br/>
And where the bluest air begun<br/>
Thirsted for song to help the heat;<br/>
As I to feel my lady's feet<br/>
Draw close before the day were done;<br/>
Both lips grew dry with dreams of it.
</p>
<p>
In the mute August afternoon<br/>
They trembled to some undertune<br/>
Of music in the silver air;<br/>
Great pleasure was it to be there<br/>
Till green turned duskier and the moon<br/>
Coloured the corn-sheaves like gold hair.
</p>
<p>
That August time it was delight<br/>
To watch the red moons wane to white<br/>
'Twixt grey seamed stems of apple-trees;<br/>
A sense of heavy harmonies<br/>
Grew on the growth of patient night,<br/>
More sweet than shapen music is.
</p>
<p>
But some three hours before the moon<br/>
The air, still eager from the noon,<br/>
Flagged after heat, not wholly dead;<br/>
Against the stem I leant my head;<br/>
The colour soothed me like a tune,<br/>
Green leaves all round the gold and red.
</p>
<p>
I lay there till the warm smell grew<br/>
More sharp, when flecks of yellow dew<br/>
Between the round ripe leaves had blurred<br/>
The rind with stain and wet; I heard<br/>
A wind that blew and breathed and blew,<br/>
Too weak to alter its one word.
</p>
<p>
The wet leaves next the gentle fruit<br/>
Felt smoother, and the brown tree-root<br/>
Felt the mould warmer: I too felt<br/>
(As water feels the slow gold melt<br/>
Right through it when the day burns mute)<br/>
The peace of time wherein love dwelt.
</p>
<p>
There were four apples on the tree,<br/>
Gold stained on red that all might see<br/>
The sweet blood filled them to the core:<br/>
The colour of her hair is more<br/>
Like stems of fair faint gold, that be<br/>
Mown from the harvest's middle floor.

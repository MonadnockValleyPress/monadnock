<h1>Maytime in Midwinter</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
A new year gleams on us, tearful<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And troubled and smiling dim<br/>
As the smile on a lip still fearful,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As glances of eyes that swim:<br/>
But the bird of my heart makes cheerful<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The days that are bright for him.
</p>
<p>
Child, how may a man's love merit<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The grace you shed as you stand,<br/>
The gift that is yours to inherit?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through you are the bleak days bland;<br/>
Your voice is a light to my spirit;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You bring the sun in your hand.
</p>
<p>
The year's wing shows not a feather<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As yet of the plumes to be;<br/>
Yet here in the shrill grey weather<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The spring's self stands at my knee,<br/>
And laughs as we commune together,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lightens the world we see.
</p>
<p>
The rains are as dews for the christening<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dawns that the nights benumb:<br/>
The spring's voice answers me listening<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For speech of a child to come,<br/>
While promise of music is glistening<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On lips that delight keeps dumb.
</p>
<p>
The mists and the storms receding<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At sight of you smile and die:<br/>
Your eyes held wide on me reading<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shed summer across the sky:<br/>
Your heart shines clear for me, heeding<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No more of the world than I.
</p>
<p>
The world, what is it to you, dear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And me, if its face be grey,<br/>
And the new-born year be a shrewd year<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For flowers that the fierce winds fray?<br/>
You smile, and the sky seems blue, dear;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You laugh, and the month turns May.
</p>
<p>
Love cares not for care, he has daffed her<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside as a mate for guile:<br/>
The sight that my soul yearns after<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeds full my sense for awhile;<br/>
Your sweet little sun-faced laughter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your good little glad grave smile.
</p>
<p>
Your hands through the bookshelves flutter;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott, Shakespeare, Dickens, are caught;<br/>
Blake's visions, that lighten and mutter;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Moli√®re&mdash;and his smile has nought<br/>
Left on it of sorrow, to utter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret things of his thought.
</p>
<p>
No grim thing written or graven<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But grows, if you gaze on it, bright;<br/>
A lark's note rings from the raven,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tragedy's robe turns white;<br/>
And shipwrecks drift into haven;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And darkness laughs, and is light.
</p>
<p>
Grief seems but a vision of madness;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Life's key-note peals from above<br/>
With nought in it more of sadness<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than broods on the heart of a dove:<br/>
At sight of you, thought grows gladness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And life, through love of you, love.

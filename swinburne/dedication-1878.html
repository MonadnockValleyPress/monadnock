<h1>Dedication</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
Some nine years gone, as we dwelt together<br/>
In the sweet hushed heat of the south French weather<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere autumn fell on the vine-tressed hills<br/>
Or the season had shed one rose-red feather,
</p>
<p>
Friend, whose fame is a flame that fills<br/>
All eyes it lightens and hearts it thrills<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With joy to be born of the blood which bred<br/>
From a land that the grey sea girds and chills
</p>
<p>
The heart and spirit and hand and head<br/>
Whose might is as light on a dark day shed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a day now dark as a land's decline<br/>
Where all the peers of your praise are dead,
</p>
<p>
In a land and season of corn and vine<br/>
I pledged you a health from a beaker of mine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But halfway filled to the lip's edge yet<br/>
With hope for honey and song for wine.
</p>
<p>
Nine years have risen and eight years set<br/>
Since there by the wellspring our hands on it met:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the pledge of my songs that were then to be,<br/>
I could wonder not, friend, though a friend should forget.
</p>
<p>
For life's helm rocks to the windward and lee,<br/>
And time is as wind, and as waves are we;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And song is as foam that the sea-winds fret,<br/>
Though the thought at its heart should be deep as the sea.

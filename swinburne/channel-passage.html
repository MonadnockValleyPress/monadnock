<h1>A Channel Passage</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
Forth from Calais, at dawn of night, when sunset summer on autumn shone,<br/>
Fared the steamer alert and loud through seas whence only the sun was gone:<br/>
Soft and sweet as the sky they smiled, and bade man welcome: a dim sweet hour<br/>
Gleamed and whispered in wind and sea, and heaven was fair as a field in flower.<br/>
Stars fulfilled the desire of the darkling world as with music: the starbright air<br/>
Made the face of the sea, if aught may make the face of the sea, more fair.
</p>
<p>
Whence came change? Was the sweet night weary of rest? What anguish awoke in the dark?<br/>
Sudden, sublime, the strong storm spake: we heard the thunders as hounds that bark.<br/>
Lovelier if aught may be lovelier than stars, we saw the lightnings exalt the sky,<br/>
Living and lustrous and rapturous as love that is born but to quicken and lighten and die.<br/>
Heaven's own heart at its highest of delight found utterance in music and semblance in fire:<br/>
Thunder on thunder exulted, rejoicing to live and to satiate the night's desire.
</p>
<p>
And the night was alive and anhungered of life as a tiger from toils cast free:<br/>
And a rapture of rage made joyous the spirit and strength of the soul of the sea.<br/>
All the weight of the wind bore down on it, freighted with death for fraught:<br/>
And the keen waves kindled and quickened as things transfigured or things distraught.<br/>
And madness fell on them laughing and leaping; and madness came on the wind:<br/>
And the might and the light and the darkness of storm were as storm in the heart of Ind.<br/>
Such glory, such terror, such passion, as lighten and harrow the far fierce East,<br/>
Rang, shone, spake, shuddered around us: the night was an altar with death for priest.<br/>
The channel that sunders England from shores where never was man born free<br/>
Was clothed with the likeness and thrilled with the strength and the wrath of a tropic sea.<br/>
As a wild steed ramps in rebellion, and rears till it swerves from a backward fall,<br/>
The strong ship struggled and reared, and her deck was upright as a sheer cliff's wall.<br/>
Stern and prow plunged under, alternate: a glimpse, a recoil, a breath,<br/>
And she sprang as the life in a god made man would spring at the throat of death.<br/>
Three glad hours, and it seemed not an hour of supreme and supernal joy,<br/>
Filled full with delight that revives in remembrance a sea-bird's heart in a boy.<br/>
For the central crest of the night was cloud that thundered and flamed, sublime<br/>
As the splendour and song of the soul everlasting that quickens the pulse of time.<br/>
The glory beholden of man in a vision, the music of light overheard,<br/>
The rapture and radiance of battle, the life that abides in the fire of a word,<br/>
In the midmost heaven enkindled, was manifest far on the face of the sea,<br/>
And the rage in the roar of the voice of the waters was heard but when heaven breathed free.<br/>
Far eastward, clear of the covering of cloud, the sky laughed out into light<br/>
From the rims of the storm to the sea's dark edge with flames that were flowerlike and white.<br/>
The leaping and luminous blossoms of live sheet lightning that laugh as they fade<br/>
From the cloud's black base to the black wave's brim rejoiced in the light they made.<br/>
Far westward, throned in a silent sky, where life was in lustrous tune,<br/>
Shone, sweeter and surer than morning or evening, the steadfast smile of the moon.<br/>
The limitless heaven that enshrined them was lovelier than dreams may behold, and deep<br/>
As life or as death, revealed and transfigured, may shine on the soul through sleep.<br/>
All glories of toil and of triumph and passion and pride that it yearns to know<br/>
Bore witness there to the soul of its likeness and kinship, above and below.<br/>
The joys of the lightnings, the songs of the thunders, the strong sea's labour and rage,<br/>
Were tokens and signs of the war that is life and is joy for the soul to wage.<br/>
No thought strikes deeper or higher than the heights and the depths that the night made bare,<br/>
Illimitable, infinite, awful and joyful, alive in the summit of air&mdash;<br/>
Air stilled and thrilled by the tempest that thundered between its reign and the sea's,<br/>
Rebellious, rapturous, and transient as faith or as terror that bows men's knees.<br/>
No love sees loftier and fairer the form of its godlike vision in dreams<br/>
Than the world shone then, when the sky and the sea were as love for a breath's length seems&mdash;<br/>
One utterly, mingled and mastering and mastered and laughing with love that subsides<br/>
As the glad mad night sank panting and satiate with storm, and released the tides.<br/>
In the dense mid channel the steam-souled ship hung hovering, assailed and withheld<br/>
As a soul born royal, if life or if death be against it, is thwarted and quelled.<br/>
As the glories of myriads of glowworms in lustrous grass on a boundless lawn<br/>
Were the glories of flames phosphoric that made of the water a light like dawn.<br/>
A thousand Phosphors, a thousand Hespers, awoke in the churning sea,<br/>
And the swift soft hiss of them living and dying was clear as a tune could be;<br/>
As a tune that is played by the fingers of death on the keys of life or of sleep,<br/>
Audible alway alive in the storm, too fleet for a dream to keep:<br/>
Too fleet, too sweet for a dream to recover and thought to remember awake:<br/>
Light subtler and swifter than lightning, that whispers and laughs in the live storm's wake,<br/>
In the wild bright wake of the storm, in the dense loud heart of the labouring hour,<br/>
A harvest of stars by the storm's hand reaped, each fair as a star-shaped flower.<br/>
And sudden and soft as the passing of sleep is the passing of tempest seemed<br/>
When the light and the sound of it sank, and the glory was gone as a dream half dreamed.<br/>
The glory, the terror, the passion that made of the midnight a miracle, died,<br/>
Not slain at a stroke, nor in gradual reluctance abated of power and of pride;<br/>
With strong swift subsidence, awful as power that is wearied of power upon earth,<br/>
As a God that were wearied of power upon heaven, and were fain of a new God's birth,<br/>
The might of the night subsided: the tyranny kindled in darkness fell:<br/>
And the sea and the sky put off them the rapture and radiance of heaven and of hell.<br/>
The waters, heaving and hungering at heart, made way, and were wellnigh fain,<br/>
For the ship that had fought them, and wrestled, and revelled in labour, to cease from her pain.<br/>
And an end was made of it: only remembrance endures of the glad loud strife;<br/>
And the sense that a rapture so royal may come not again in the passage of life.

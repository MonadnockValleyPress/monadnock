<h1>Before the Mirror</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>(Verses Written under a Picture)</h3>
<h3>Inscribed to J.A. Whistler</h3>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
White rose in red rose-garden<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not so white;<br/>
Snowdrops that plead for pardon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pine for fright<br/>
Because the hard East blows<br/>
Over their maiden rows<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grow not as this face grows from pale to bright.
</p>
<p>
Behind the veil, forbidden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut up from sight,<br/>
Love, is there sorrow hidden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there delight?<br/>
Is joy thy dower or grief,<br/>
White rose of weary leaf,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late rose whose life is brief, whose loves are light?
</p>
<p>
Soft snows that hard winds harden<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till each flake bite<br/>
Fill all the flowerless garden<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose flowers took flight<br/>
Long since when summer ceased,<br/>
And men rose up from feast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And warm west wind grew east, and warm day night.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
"Come snow, come wind or thunder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High up in air,<br/>
I watch my face, and wonder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At my bright hair;<br/>
Nought else exalts or grieves<br/>
The rose at heart, that heaves<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With love of her own leaves and lips that pair.
</p>
<p>
"She knows not loves that kissed her<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows not where.<br/>
Art thou the ghost, my sister,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White sister there,<br/>
Am I the ghost, who knows?<br/>
My hand, a fallen rose,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies snow-white on white snows, and takes no care.
</p>
<p>
"I cannot see what pleasures<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or what pains were;<br/>
What pale new loves and treasures<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New years will bear;<br/>
What beam will fall, what shower,<br/>
What grief or joy for dower;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one thing-knows the flower; the flower is fair."
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
Glad, but not flushed with gladness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since joys go by;<br/>
Sad, but not bent with sadness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since sorrows die;<br/>
Deep in the gleaming glass<br/>
She sees all past things pass,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all sweet life that was lie down and lie.
</p>
<p>
There glowing ghosts of flowers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw down, draw nigh;<br/>
And wings of swift spent hours<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take flight and fly;<br/>
She sees by formless gleams,<br/>
She hears across cold streams,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead mouths of many dreams that sing and sigh.
</p>
<p>
Face fallen and white throat lifted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sleepless eye<br/>
She sees old loves that drifted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew not why,<br/>
Old loves and faded fears<br/>
Float down a stream that hears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowing of all men's tears beneath the sky.

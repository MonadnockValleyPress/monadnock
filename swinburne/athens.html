<h1>Athens: An Ode</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>Strophe 1</h3>
<p>
Ere from under earth again like fire the violet kindle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the holy buds and hoar on olive-branches bloom,<br/>
Ere the crescent of the last pale month of winter dwindle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrink, and fall as falls a dead leaf on the dead month's tomb,<br/>
Round the hills whose heights the first-born olive-blossom brightened,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the city brow-bound once with violets like a bride,<br/>
Up from under earth again a light that long since lightened<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaks, whence all the world took comfort as all time takes pride.<br/>
Pride have all men in their fathers that were free before them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the warriors that begat us free-born pride have we:<br/>
But the fathers of their spirits, how may men adore them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With what rapture may we praise, who bade our souls be free?<br/>
Sons of Athens born in spirit and truth are all born free men;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of all, we, nurtured where the north wind holds his reign:<br/>
Children all we sea-folk of the Salaminian seamen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sons of them that beat back Persia they that beat back Spain.<br/>
Since the songs of Greece fell silent, none like ours have risen;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the sails of Greece fell slack, no ships have sailed like ours;<br/>
How should we lament not, if her spirit sit in prison?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How should we rejoice not, if her wreaths renew their flowers?<br/>
All the world is sweeter, if the Athenian violet quicken:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All the world is brighter, if the Athenian sun return:<br/>
All things foul on earth wax fainter, by that sun's light stricken:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All ill growths are withered, where those fragrant flower-lights burn.<br/>
All the wandering waves of seas with all their warring waters<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll the record on for ever of the sea-fight there,<br/>
When the capes were battle's lists, and all the straits were slaughter's,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the myriad Medes as foam-flakes on the scattering air.<br/>
Ours the lightning was that cleared the north and lit the nations,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the light that gave the whole world light of old was she:<br/>
Ours an age or twain, but hers are endless generations:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All the world is hers at heart, and most of all are we.<br/>
</p>
<h3>Antistrophe 1</h3>
<p>
Ye that bear the name about you of her glory,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Men that wear the sign of Greeks upon you sealed,<br/>
Yours is yet the choice to write yourselves in story<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sons of them that fought the Marathonian field.<br/>
Slaves of no man were ye, said your warrior poet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither subject unto man as underlings:<br/>
Yours is now the season here wherein to show it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the seed ye be of them that knew not kings.<br/>
If ye be not, swords nor words alike found brittle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the dust of death to raise you shall prevail:<br/>
Subject swords and dead men's words may stead you little,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If their old king-hating heart within you fail.<br/>
If your spirit of old, and not your bonds, be broken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the kingless heart be molten in your breasts,<br/>
By what signs and wonders, by what word or token,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall ye drive the vultures from your eagles' nests?<br/>
All the gains of tyrants Freedom counts for losses;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought of all the work done holds she worth the work,<br/>
When the slaves whose faith is set on crowns and crosses<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drive the Cossack bear against the tiger Turk.<br/>
Neither cross nor crown nor crescent shall ye bow to,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought of Araby nor Jewry, priest nor king:<br/>
As your watchword was of old, so be it now too:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As from lips long stilled, from yours let healing spring.<br/>
Through the fights of old, your battle-cry was healing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Saviour that ye called on was the Sun:<br/>
Dawn by dawn behold in heaven your God, revealing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Light from darkness as when Marathon was won.<br/>
Gods were yours yet strange to Turk or Galilean,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Light and Wisdom only then as gods adored:<br/>
Pallas was your shield, your comforter was P&aelig;an,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From your bright world's navel spake the Sun your Lord.<br/>
</p>
<h3>Epode 1</h3>
<p>
Though the names be lost, and changed the signs of Light and Wisdom be,<br/>
By these only shall men conquer, by these only be set free:<br/>
When the whole world's eye was Athens, these were yours, and theirs were ye.<br/>
Light was given you of your wisdom, light ye gave the world again:<br/>
As the sun whose godhead lightened on her soul was Hellas then:<br/>
Yea, the least of all her children as the chosen of other men.<br/>
Change your hearts not with your garments, nor your faith with creeds that change:<br/>
Truth was yours, the truth which time and chance transform not nor estrange:<br/>
Purer truth nor higher abides not in the reach of time's whole range.<br/>
Gods are they in all men's memories and for all time's periods,<br/>
They that hurled the host back seaward which had scourged the sea with rods:<br/>
Gods for us are all your fathers, even the least of these as gods.<br/>
In the dark of days the thought of them is with us, strong to save,<br/>
They that had no lord, and made the Great King lesser than a slave;<br/>
They that rolled all Asia back on Asia, broken like a wave.<br/>
No man's men were they, no master's and no God's but these their own:<br/>
Gods not loved in vain nor served amiss, nor all yet overthrown:<br/>
Love of country, Freedom, Wisdom, Light, and none save these alone.<br/>
King by king came up against them, sire and son, and turned to flee:<br/>
Host on host roared westward, mightier each than each, if more might be:<br/>
Field to field made answer, clamorous like as wave to wave at sea.<br/>
Strife to strife responded, loud as rocks to clangorous rocks respond<br/>
Where the deep rings wreck to seamen held in tempest's thrall and bond,<br/>
Till when war's bright work was perfect peace as radiant rose beyond:<br/>
Peace made bright with fruit of battle, stronger made for storm gone down,<br/>
With the flower of song held heavenward for the violet of her crown<br/>
Woven about the fragrant forehead of the fostress maiden's town.<br/>
Gods arose alive on earth from under stroke of human hands:<br/>
As the hands that wrought them, these are dead, and mixed with time's dead sands:<br/>
But the godhead of supernal song, though these now stand not, stands.<br/>
Pallas is not, Ph&oelig;bus breathes no more in breathing brass or gold:<br/>
Clyt&aelig;mnestra towers, Cassandra wails, for ever: Time is bold,<br/>
But nor heart nor hand hath he to unwrite the scriptures writ of old.<br/>
Dead the great chryselephantine God, as dew last evening shed:<br/>
Dust of earth or foam of ocean is the symbol of his head:<br/>
Earth and ocean shall be shadows when Prometheus shall be dead.<br/>
</p>
<h3>Strophe s2</h3>
<p>
Fame around her warriors living rang through Greece and lightened,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving equal with their stature, stately with their strength:<br/>
Thebes and Laced&aelig;mon at their breathing presence brightened,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sense or sound of them filled all the live land's breadth and length.<br/>
All the lesser tribes put on the pure Athenian fashion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One Hellenic heart was from the mountains to the sea:<br/>
Sparta's bitter self grew sweet with high half-human passion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And her dry thorns flushed aflower in strait Thermopyl&aelig;.<br/>
Fruitless yet the flowers had fallen, and all the deeds died fruitless,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save that tongues of after men, the children of her peace,<br/>
Took the tale up of her glories, transient else and rootless,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And in ears and hearts of all men left the praise of Greece.<br/>
Fair the war-time was when still, as beacon answering beacon,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea to land flashed fight, and thundered note of wrath or cheer;<br/>
But the strength of noonday night hath power to waste and weaken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor may light be passed from hand to hand of year to year<br/>
If the dying deed be saved not, ere it die for ever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the hands and lips of men more wise than years are strong;<br/>
If the soul of man take heed not that the deed die never,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clothed about with purple and gold of story, crowned with song.<br/>
Still the burning heart of boy and man alike rejoices,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing words which made it seem of old for all who sang<br/>
That their heaven of heavens waxed happier when from free men's voices<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Well-beloved Harmodius and Aristogeiton</em> rang.<br/>
Never fell such fragrance from the flower-month's rose-red kirtle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As from chaplets on the bright friends' brows who slew their lord:<br/>
Greener grew the leaf and balmier blew the flower of myrtle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When its blossom sheathed the sheer tyrannicidal sword.<br/>
None so glorious garland crowned the feast Panathen&aelig;an<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As this wreath too frail to fetter fast the Cyprian dove:<br/>
None so fiery song sprang sunwards annual as the p&aelig;an<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Praising perfect love of friends and perfect country's love.<br/>
</p>
<h3>Antistrophe 2</h3>
<p>
Higher than highest of all those heavens wherefrom the starry<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Song of Homer shone above the rolling fight,<br/>
Gleams like spring's green bloom on boughs all gaunt and gnarry<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft live splendour as of flowers of foam in flight,<br/>
Glows a glory of mild-winged maidens upward mounting<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheer through air made shrill with strokes of smooth swift wings<br/>
Round the rocks beyond foot's reach, past eyesight's counting,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the cleft where iron wind of winter rings<br/>
Round a God fast clenched in iron jaws of fetters,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Him who culled for man the fruitful flower of fire,<br/>
Bared the darkling scriptures writ in dazzling letters,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Taught the truth of dreams deceiving men's desire,<br/>
Gave their water-wandering chariot-seats of ocean<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wings, and bade the rage of war-steeds champ the rein,<br/>
Showed the symbols of the wild birds' wheeling motion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Waged for man's sake war with God and all his train.<br/>
Earth, whose name was also Righteousness, a mother<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Many-named and single-natured, gave him breath<br/>
Whence God's wrath could wring but this word and none other&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>He may smite me, yet he shall not do to death.</em><br/>
Him the tongue that sang triumphant while tormented<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang as loud the sevenfold storm that roared erewhile<br/>
Round the towers of Thebes till wrath might rest contented:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang the flight from smooth soft-sanded banks of Nile,<br/>
When like mateless doves that fly from snare or tether<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the suppliants landwards trembling as they trod,<br/>
And the prayer took wing from all their tongues together&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>King of kings, most holy of holies, blessed God.</em><br/>
But what mouth may chant again, what heart may know it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All the rapture that all hearts of men put on<br/>
When of Salamis the time-transcending poet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang, whose hand had chased the Mede at Marathon?<br/>
</p>
<h3>Epode 1</h3>
<p>
Darker dawned the song with stormier wings above the watch-fire spread<br/>
Whence from Ida toward the hill of Hermes leapt the light that said<br/>
Troy was fallen, a torch funereal for the king's triumphal head.<br/>
Dire indeed the birth of Leda's womb that had God's self to sire<br/>
Bloomed, a flower of love that stung the soul with fangs that gnaw like fire:<br/>
But the twin-born human-fathered sister-flower bore fruit more dire.<br/>
Scarce the cry that called on airy heaven and all swift winds on wing,<br/>
Wells of river-heads, and countless laugh of waves past reckoning,<br/>
Earth which brought forth all, and the orb&egrave;d sun that looks on everything,<br/>
Scarce that cry fills yet men's hearts more full of heart-devouring dread<br/>
Than the murderous word said mocking, how the child whose blood he shed<br/>
Might clasp fast and kiss her father where the dead salute the dead.<br/>
But the latter note of anguish from the lips that mocked her lord,<br/>
When her son's hand bared against the breast that suckled him his sword,<br/>
How might man endure, O &AElig;schylus, to hear it and record?<br/>
How might man endure, being mortal yet, O thou most highest, to hear?<br/>
How record, being born of woman? Surely not thy Furies near,<br/>
Surely this beheld, this only, blasted hearts to death with fear.<br/>
Not the hissing hair, nor flakes of blood that oozed from eyes of fire,<br/>
Nor the snort of savage sleep that snuffed the hungering heart's desire<br/>
Where the hunted prey found hardly space and harbour to respire;<br/>
She whose likeness called them&mdash;"Sleep ye, ho? what need of you that sleep?"<br/>
(Ah, what need indeed, where she was, of all shapes that night may keep<br/>
Hidden dark as death and deeper than men's dreams of hell are deep?)<br/>
She the murderess of her husband, she the huntress of her son,<br/>
More than ye was she, the shadow that no God withstands but one,<br/>
Wisdom equal-eyed and stronger and more splendid than the sun.<br/>
Yea, no God may stand betwixt us and the shadows of our deeds,<br/>
Nor the light of dreams that lighten darkness, nor the prayer that pleads,<br/>
But the wisdom equal-souled with heaven, the light alone that leads.<br/>
Light whose law bids home those childless children of eternal night,<br/>
Soothed and reconciled and mastered and transmuted in men's sight<br/>
Who behold their own souls, clothed with darkness once, now clothed with light.<br/>
King of kings and father crowned of all our fathers crowned of yore,<br/>
Lord of all the lords of song, whose head all heads bow down before,<br/>
Glory be to thee from all thy sons in all tongues evermore.<br/>
</p>
<h3>Strophe 3</h3>
<p>
Rose and vine and olive and deep ivy-bloom entwining<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the goodliest grave that e'er they closeliest might entwine<br/>
Keep the wind from wasting and the sun from too strong shining<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the sound and light of sweetest songs still float and shine.<br/>
Here the music seems to illume the shade, the light to whisper<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Song, the flowers to put not odours only forth, but words<br/>
Sweeter far than fragrance: here the wandering wreaths twine crisper<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Far, and louder far exults the note of all wild birds.<br/>
Thoughts that change us, joys that crown and sorrows that enthrone us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Passions that enrobe us with a clearer air than ours,<br/>
Move and breathe as living things beheld round white Colonus,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Audibler than melodies and visibler than flowers.<br/>
Love, in fight unconquered, Love, with spoils of great men laden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never sang so sweet from throat of woman or of dove:<br/>
Love, whose bed by night is in the soft cheeks of a maiden,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his march is over seas, and low roofs lack not Love;<br/>
Nor may one of all that live, ephemeral or eternal,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fly nor hide from Love; but whoso clasps him fast goes mad.<br/>
Never since the first-born year with flowers first-born grew vernal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a song made listening hearts of lovers glad or sad.<br/>
Never sounded note so radiant at the rayless portal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening wide on the all-concealing lowland of the dead<br/>
As the music mingling, when her doomsday marked her mortal,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From her own and old men's voices round the bride's way shed,<br/>
Round the grave her bride-house, hewn for endless habitation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, shut out from sunshine, with no bridegroom by, she slept;<br/>
But beloved of all her dark and fateful generation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But with all time's tears and praise besprinkled and bewept:<br/>
Well-beloved of outcast father and self-slaughtered mother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Born, yet unpolluted, of their blind incestuous bed;<br/>
Best-beloved of him for whose dead sake she died, her brother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hallowing by her own life's gift her own born brother's head;<br/>
</p>
<h3>Antistrophe 3</h3>
<p>
Not with wine or oil nor any less libation
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hallowed, nor made sweet with humbler perfume's breath;<br/>
Not with only these redeemed from desecration,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But with blood and spirit of life poured forth to death;<br/>
Blood unspotted, spirit unsullied, life devoted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister too supreme to make the bride's hope good,<br/>
Daughter too divine as woman to be noted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Spouse of only death in mateless maidenhood.<br/>
Yea, in her was all the prayer fulfilled, the saying<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All accomplished&mdash;<em>Would that fate would let me wear</em><br/>
<em>Hallowed innocence of words and all deeds, weighing</em><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Well the laws thereof, begot on holier air,</em><br/>
<em>Far on high sublimely stablished, whereof only</em><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Heaven is father; nor did birth of mortal mould</em><br/>
<em>Bring them forth, nor shall oblivion lull to lonely</em><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Slumber. Great in these is God, and grows not old.</em><br/>
Therefore even that inner darkness where she perished<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely seems as holy and lovely, seen aright,<br/>
As desirable and as dearly to be cherished,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As the haunt closed in with laurels from the light,<br/>
Deep inwound with olive and wild vine inwoven,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a godhead known and unknown makes men pale,<br/>
But the darkness of the twilight noon is cloven<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still with shrill sweet moan of many a nightingale.<br/>
Closer clustering there they make sweet noise together,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the fearful gods look gentler than our fear,<br/>
And the grove thronged through with birds of holiest feather<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grows nor pale nor dumb with sense of dark things near.<br/>
There her father, called upon with signs of wonder,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed with tenderest words away by ways unknown,<br/>
Not by sea-storm stricken down, nor touched of thunder,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the dark benign deep underworld, alone.<br/>
</p>
<h3>Epode 3</h3>
<p>
Third of three that ruled in Athens, kings with sceptral song for staff,<br/>
Gladdest heart that God gave ever milk and wine of thought to quaff,<br/>
Clearest eye that lightened ever to the broad lip's lordliest laugh,<br/>
Praise be thine as theirs whose tragic brows the loftier leaf engirds<br/>
For the live and lyric lightning of thy honey-hearted words,<br/>
Soft like sunny dewy wings of clouds and bright as crying of birds;<br/>
Full of all sweet rays and notes that make of earth and air and sea<br/>
One great light and sound of laughter from one great God's heart, to be<br/>
Sign and semblance of the gladness of man's life where men breathe free.<br/>
With no Loxian sound obscure God uttered once, and all time heard,<br/>
All the soul of Athens, all the soul of England, in that word:<br/>
Rome arose the second child of freedom: northward rose the third.<br/>
Ere her Boreal dawn came kindling seas afoam and fields of snow,<br/>
Yet again, while Europe groaned and grovelled, shone like suns aglow<br/>
Doria splendid over Genoa, Venice bright with Dandolo.<br/>
Dead was Hellas, but Ausonia by the light of dead men's deeds<br/>
Rose and walked awhile alive, though mocked as whom the fen-fire leads<br/>
By the creed-wrought faith of faithless souls that mock their doubts with creeds.<br/>
Dead are these, and man is risen again: and haply now the three<br/>
Yet coequal and triune may stand in story, marked as free<br/>
By the token of the washing of the waters of the sea.<br/>
Athens first of all earth's kindred many-tongued and many-kinned<br/>
Had the sea to friend and comfort, and for kinsman had the wind:<br/>
She that bare Columbus next: then she that made her spoil of Ind.<br/>
She that hears not what man's rage but only what the sea-wind saith:<br/>
She that turned Spain's ships to cloud-wrack at the blasting of her breath,<br/>
By her strengths of strong-souled children and of strong winds done to death.<br/>
North and south the Great King's galleons went in Persian wise: and here<br/>
She, with &AElig;schylean music on her lips that laughed back fear,<br/>
In the face of Time's grey godhead shook the splendour of her spear.<br/>
Fair as Athens then with foot upon her foeman's front, and strong<br/>
Even as Athens for redemption of the world from sovereign wrong,<br/>
Like as Athens crowned she stood before the sun with crowning song.<br/>
All the world is theirs with whom is freedom: first of all the free,<br/>
Blest are they whom song has crowned and clothed with blessing: these as we,<br/>
These alone have part in spirit with the sun that crowns the sea.<br/>

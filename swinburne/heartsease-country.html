<h1>Heartsease Country</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>To Isabel Swinburne</h3>
<p>
The far green westward heavens are bland,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The far green Wiltshire downs are clear<br/>
As these deep meadows hard at hand:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sight knows hardly far from near,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor morning joy from evening cheer.<br/>
In cottage garden-plots their bees<br/>
Find many a fervent flower to seize<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And strain and drain the heart away<br/>
From ripe sweet-williams and sweet-peas<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At every turn on every way.
</p>
<p>
But gladliest seems one flower to expand<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its whole sweet heart all round us here;<br/>
'Tis Heartsease Country, Pansy Land.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor sounds nor savours harsh and drear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where engines yell and halt and veer<br/>
Can vex the sense of him who sees<br/>
One flower-plot midway, that for trees<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has poles, and sheds all grimed or grey<br/>
For bowers like those that take the breeze<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At every turn on every way.
</p>
<p>
Content even there they smile and stand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet thought's heart-easing flowers, nor fear,<br/>
With reek and roaring steam though fanned,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor shrink nor perish as they peer.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart's eye holds not those more dear<br/>
That glow between the lanes and leas<br/>
Where'er the homeliest hand may please<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To bid them blossom as they may<br/>
Where light approves and wind agrees<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At every turn on every way.
</p>
<p>
Sister, the word of winds and seas<br/>
Endures not as the word of these<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your wayside flowers whose breath would say<br/>
How hearts that love may find heart's ease<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At every turn on every way.

<h1>Sapphics</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne (1904)</h2>
<p>
All the night sleep came not upon my eyelids,<br/>
Shed not dew, nor shook nor unclosed a feather,<br/>
Yet with lips shut close and with eyes of iron<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood and beheld me.
</p>
<p>
Then to me so lying awake a vision<br/>
Came without sleep over the seas and touched me,<br/>
Softly touched mine eyelids and lips; and I too,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of the vision,
</p>
<p>
Saw the white implacable Aphrodite,<br/>
Saw the hair unbound and the feet unsandalled<br/>
Shine as fire of sunset on western waters;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the reluctant
</p>
<p>
Feet, the straining plumes of the doves that drew her,<br/>
Looking always, looking with necks reverted,<br/>
Back to Lesbos, back to the hills whereunder<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone Mitylene;
</p>
<p>
Heard the flying feet of the Loves behind her<br/>
Make a sudden thunder upon the waters,<br/>
As the thunder flung from the strong unclosing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wings of a great wind.
</p>
<p>
So the goddess fled from her place, with awful<br/>
Sound of feet and thunder of wings around her;<br/>
While behind a clamour of singing women<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severed the twilight.
</p>
<p>
Ah the singing, ah the delight, the passion!<br/>
All the Loves wept, listening; sick with anguish,<br/>
Stood the crowned nine Muses about Apollo;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear was upon them,
</p>
<p>
While the tenth sang wonderful things they knew not.<br/>
Ah the tenth, the Lesbian! the nine were silent,<br/>
None endured the sound of her song for weeping;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurel by laurel,
</p>
<p>
Faded all their crowns; but about her forehead,<br/>
Round her woven tresses and ashen temples<br/>
White as dead snow, paler than grass in summer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ravaged with kisses,
</p>
<p>
Shone a light of fire as a crown for ever.<br/>
Yea, almost the implacable Aphrodite<br/>
Paused, and almost wept; such a song was that song.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, by her name too
</p>
<p>
Called her, saying, "Turn to me, O my Sappho;"<br/>
Yet she turned her face from the Loves, she saw not<br/>
Tears for laughter darken immortal eyelids,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard not about her
</p>
<p>
Fearful fitful wings of the doves departing,<br/>
Saw not how the bosom of Aphrodite<br/>
Shook with weeping, saw not her shaken raiment,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw not her hands wrung;
</p>
<p>
Saw the Lesbians kissing across their smitten<br/>
Lutes with lips more sweet than the sound of lute-strings,<br/>
Mouth to mouth and hand upon hand, her chosen,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairer than all men;
</p>
<p>
Only saw the beautiful lips and fingers,<br/>
Full of songs and kisses and little whispers,<br/>
Full of music; only beheld among them<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soar, as a bird soars
</p>
<p>
Newly fledged, her visible song, a marvel,<br/>
Made of perfect sound and exceeding passion,<br/>
Sweetly shapen, terrible, full of thunders,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clothed with the wind's wings.
</p>
<p>
Then rejoiced she, laughing with love, and scattered<br/>
Roses, awful roses of holy blossom;<br/>
Then the Loves thronged sadly with hidden faces<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round Aphrodite,
</p>
<p>
Then the Muses, stricken at heart, were silent;<br/>
Yea, the gods waxed pale; such a song was that song.<br/>
All reluctant, all with a fresh repulsion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fled from before her.
</p>
<p>
All withdrew long since, and the land was barren,<br/>
Full of fruitless women and music only.<br/>
Now perchance, when winds are assuaged at sunset,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lulled at the dewfall,
</p>
<p>
By the grey sea-side, unassuaged, unheard of,<br/>
Unbeloved, unseen in the ebb of twilight,<br/>
Ghosts of outcast women return lamenting,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purged not in Lethe,
</p>
<p>
Clothed about with flame and with tears, and singing<br/>
Songs that move the heart of the shaken heaven,<br/>
Songs that break the heart of the earth with pity,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing, to hear them.

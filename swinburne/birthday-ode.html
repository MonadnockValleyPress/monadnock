<h1>Birthday Ode</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>August 6, 1891</h3>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
Love and praise, and a length of days whose shadow cast upon time is light,<br/>
Days whose sound was a spell shed round from wheeling wings as of doves in flight,<br/>
Meet in one, that the mounting sun to-day may triumph, and cast out night.
</p>
<p>
Two years more than the full fourscore lay hallowing hands on a sacred head&mdash;<br/>
Scarce one score of the perfect four uncrowned of fame as they smiled and fled:<br/>
Still and soft and alive aloft their sunlight stays though the suns be dead.
</p>
<p>
Ere we were or were thought on, ere the love that gave us to life began,<br/>
Fame grew strong with his crescent song, to greet the goal of the race they ran,<br/>
Song with fame, and the lustrous name with years whose changes acclaimed the man.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
Soon, ere time in the rounding rhyme of choral seasons had hailed us men,<br/>
We too heard and acclaimed the word whose breath was life upon England then&mdash;<br/>
Life more bright than the breathless light of soundless noon in a songless glen.
</p>
<p>
Ah, the joy of the heartstruck boy whose ear was opened of love to hear!<br/>
Ah, the bliss of the burning kiss of song and spirit, the mounting cheer<br/>
Lit with fire of divine desire and love that knew not if love were fear!
</p>
<p>
Fear and love as of heaven above and earth enkindled of heaven were one;<br/>
One white flame, that around his name grew keen and strong as the worldwide sun;<br/>
Awe made bright with implied delight, as weft with weft of the rainbow spun.
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
He that fears not the voice he hears and loves shall never have heart to sing:<br/>
All the grace of the sun-god's face that bids the soul as a fountain spring<br/>
Bids the brow that receives it bow, and hail his likeness on earth as king.
</p>
<p>
We that knew when the sun's shaft flew beheld and worshipped, adored and heard:<br/>
Light rang round it of shining sound, whence all men's hearts were subdued and stirred:<br/>
Joy, love, sorrow, the day, the morrow, took life upon them in one man's word.
</p>
<p>
Not for him can the years wax dim, nor downward swerve on a darkening way:<br/>
Upward wind they, and leave behind such light as lightens the front of May:<br/>
Fair as youth and sublime as truth we find the fame that we hail to-day.

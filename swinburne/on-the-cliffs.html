<h1>On the Cliffs</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
  ἰμερόφωνος ἀήδων
  <br/><br/>
  &mdash;Sappho.
</blockquote>
<p>
Between the moondawn and the sundown here<br/>
The twilight hangs half starless; half the sea<br/>
Still quivers as for love or pain or fear<br/>
Or pleasure mightier than these all may be<br/>
A man's live heart might beat<br/>
Wherein a God's with mortal blood should meet<br/>
And fill its pulse too full to bear the strain<br/>
With fear or love or pleasure's twin-born, pain.<br/>
Fiercely the gaunt woods to the grim soil cling<br/>
That bears for all fair fruits<br/>
Wan wild sparse flowers of windy and wintry spring<br/>
Between the tortive serpent-shapen roots<br/>
Wherethrough their dim growth hardly strikes and shoots<br/>
And shews one gracious thing<br/>
Hardly, to speak for summer one sweet word<br/>
Of summer's self scarce heard.<br/>
But higher the steep green sterile fields, thick-set<br/>
With flowerless hawthorn even to the upward verge<br/>
Whence the woods gathering watch new cliffs emerge<br/>
Higher than their highest of crowns that sea-winds fret,</span>
Hold fast, for all that night or wind can say,<br/>
Some pale pure colour yet,<br/>
Too dim for green and luminous for grey.<br/>
Between the climbing inland cliffs above<br/>
And these beneath that breast and break the bay,<br/>
A barren peace too soft for hate or love<br/>
Broods on an hour too dim for night or day.
</p>
<p>
O wind, O wingless wind that walk'st the sea,<br/>
Weak wind, wing-broken, wearier wind than we,<br/>
Who are yet not spirit-broken, maimed like thee,<br/>
Who wail not in our inward night as thou<br/>
In the outer darkness now,<br/>
What word has the old sea given thee for mine ear<br/>
From thy faint lips to hear?<br/>
For some word would she send me, knowing not how.
</p>
<p>
Nay, what far other word<br/>
Than ever of her was spoken, or of me<br/>
Or all my winged white kinsfolk of the sea<br/>
Between fresh wave and wave was ever heard,<br/>
Cleaves the clear dark enwinding tree with tree<br/>
Too close for stars to separate and to see<br/>
Enmeshed in multitudinous unity?<br/>
What voice of what strong God hath stormed and stirred<br/>
The fortressed rock of silence, rent apart<br/>
Even to the core Night's all-maternal heart?<br/>
What voice of God grown heavenlier in a bird,<br/>
Made keener of edge to smite<br/>
Than lightning&mdash;yea, thou knowest, O mother Night,<br/>
Keen as that cry from thy strange children sent<br/>
Wherewith the Athenian judgment-shrine was rent,<br/>
For wrath that all their wrath was vainly spent,</span>
Their wrath for wrong made right<br/>
By justice in her own divine despite<br/>
That bade pass forth unblamed<br/>
The sinless matricide and unashamed?<br/>
Yea, what new cry is this, what note more bright<br/>
Than their song's wing of words was dark of flight,<br/>
What word is this thou hast heard,<br/>
Thine and not thine or theirs, O Night, what word<br/>
More keen than lightning and more sweet than light?<br/>
As all men's hearts grew godlike in one bird<br/>
And all those hearts cried on thee, crying with might,<br/>
Hear us, O mother Night.
</p>
<p>
Dumb is the mouth of darkness as of death:<br/>
Light, sound and life are one<br/>
In the eyes and lips of dawn that draw the sun<br/>
To hear what first child's word with glimmering breath<br/>
Their weak wan weanling child the twilight saith;<br/>
But night makes answer none.
</p>
<p>
God, if thou be God,&mdash;bird, if bird thou be,&mdash;<br/>
Do thou then answer me.<br/>
For but one word, what wind soever blow,<br/>
Is blown up usward ever from the sea.<br/>
In fruitless years of youth dead long ago<br/>
And deep beneath their own dead leaves and snow<br/>
Buried, I heard with bitter heart and sere<br/>
The same sea's word unchangeable, nor knew<br/>
But that mine own life-days were changeless too<br/>
And sharp and salt with unshed tear on tear<br/>
And cold and fierce and barren; and my soul,<br/>
Sickening, swam weakly with bated breath<br/>
In a deep sea like death,</span>
And felt the wind buffet her face with brine<br/>
Hard, and harsh thought on thought in long bleak roll<br/>
Blown by keen gusts of memory sad as thine<br/>
Heap the weight up of pain, and break, and leave<br/>
Strength scarce enough to grieve<br/>
In the sick heavy spirit, unmanned with strife<br/>
Of waves that beat at the tired lips of life.
</p>
<p>
Nay, sad may be man's memory, sad may be<br/>
The dream he weaves him as for shadow of thee,<br/>
But scarce one breathing-space, one heartbeat long,<br/>
Wilt thou take shadow of sadness on thy song.<br/>
Not thou, being more than man or man's desire,<br/>
Being bird and God in one,<br/>
With throat of gold and spirit of the sun;<br/>
The sun whom all our souls and songs call sire,<br/>
Whose godhead gave thee, chosen of all our quire,<br/>
Thee only of all that serve, of all that sing<br/>
Before our sire and king,<br/>
Borne up some space on time's world-wandering wing,<br/>
This gift, this doom, to bear till time's wing tire&mdash;<br/>
Life everlasting of eternal fire.
</p>
<p>
Thee only of all; yet can no memory say<br/>
How many a night and day<br/>
My heart has been as thy heart, and my life<br/>
As thy life is, a sleepless hidden thing,<br/>
Full of the thirst and hunger of winter and spring,<br/>
That seeks its food not in such love or strife<br/>
As fill men's hearts with passionate hours and rest.<br/>
From no loved lips and on no loving breast<br/>
Have I sought ever for such gifts as bring</span>
Comfort, to stay the secret soul with sleep.<br/>
The joys, the loves, the labours, whence men reap<br/>
Rathe fruit of hopes and fears,<br/>
I have made not mine; the best of all my days<br/>
Have been as those fair fruitless summer strays,<br/>
Those water-waifs that but the sea-wind steers,<br/>
Flakes of glad foam or flowers on footless ways<br/>
That take the wind in season and the sun,<br/>
And when the wind wills is their season done.
</p>
<p>
For all my days as all thy days from birth<br/>
My heart as thy heart was in me as thee,<br/>
Fire; and not all the fountains of the sea<br/>
Have waves enough to quench it, nor on earth<br/>
Is fuel enough to feed,<br/>
While day sows night and night sows day for seed.
</p>
<p>
We were not marked for sorrow, thou nor I,<br/>
For joy nor sorrow, sister, were we made,<br/>
To take delight and grief to live and die,<br/>
Assuaged by pleasures or by pains affrayed<br/>
That melt men's hearts and alter; we retain<br/>
A memory mastering pleasure and all pain,<br/>
A spirit within the sense of ear and eye,<br/>
A soul behind the soul, that seeks and sings<br/>
And makes our life move only with its wings<br/>
And feed but from its lips, that in return<br/>
Feed of our hearts wherein the old fires that burn<br/>
Have strength not to consume<br/>
Nor glory enough to exalt us past our doom.
</p>
<p>
<em>Ah, ah, the doom</em> (thou knowest whence rang that wail)<br/>
<em>Of the shrill nightingale!</em></span>
(From whose wild lips, thou knowest, that wail was thrown)<br/>
<em>For round about her have the great gods cast</em><br/>
<em>A wing-borne body, and clothed her close and fast</em><br/>
<em>With a sweet life that hath no part in moan.</em><br/>
<em>But me, for me</em> (how hadst thou heart to hear?)<br/>
<em>Remains a sundering with the two-edged spear.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Ah, for her doom!</em> so cried in presage then<br/>
The bodeful bondslave of the king of men,<br/>
And might not win her will.<br/>
Too close the entangling dragnet woven of crime,<br/>
The snare of ill new-born of elder ill,<br/>
The curse of new time for an elder time,<br/>
Had caught, and held her yet,<br/>
Enmeshed intolerably in the intolerant net,<br/>
Who thought with craft to mock the God most high,<br/>
And win by wiles his crown of prophecy<br/>
From the Sun's hand sublime,<br/>
As God were man, to spare or to forget.
</p>
<p>
But thou,&mdash;the gods have given thee and forgiven thee<br/>
More than our master gave<br/>
That strange-eyed spirit-wounded strange-tongued slave<br/>
There questing houndlike where the roofs red-wet<br/>
Reeked as a wet red grave.<br/>
Life everlasting has their strange grace given thee,<br/>
Even hers whom thou wast wont to sing and serve<br/>
With eyes, but not with song, too swift to swerve;<br/>
Yet might not even thine eyes estranged estrange her,<br/>
Who seeing thee too, but inly, burn and bleed<br/>
Like that pale princess-priest of Priam's seed,<br/>
For stranger service gave thee guerdon stranger;</span>
If this indeed be guerdon, this indeed<br/>
Her mercy, this thy meed&mdash;<br/>
That thou, being more than all we born, being higher<br/>
Than all heads crowned of him that only gives<br/>
The light whereby man lives,<br/>
The bay that bids man moved of God's desire<br/>
Lay hand on lute or lyre,<br/>
Set lip to trumpet or deflowered green reed&mdash;<br/>
If this were given thee for a grace indeed,<br/>
That thou, being first of all these, thou alone<br/>
Shouldst have the grace to die not, but to live<br/>
And lose nor change one pulse of song, one tone<br/>
Of all that were thy lady's and thine own,<br/>
Thy lady's whom thou criedst on to forgive,<br/>
Thou, priest and sacrifice on the altar-stone<br/>
Where none may worship not of all that live,<br/>
Love's priestess, errant on dark ways diverse;<br/>
If this were grace indeed for Love to give,<br/>
If this indeed were blessing and no curse.
</p>
<p>
Love's priestess, mad with pain and joy of song,<br/>
Song's priestess, mad with joy and pain of love,<br/>
Name above all names that are lights above,<br/>
We have loved, praised, pitied, crowned and done thee wrong,<br/>
O thou past praise and pity; thou the sole<br/>
Utterly deathless, perfect only and whole<br/>
Immortal, body and soul.<br/>
For over all whom time hath overpast<br/>
The shadow of sleep inexorable is cast,<br/>
The implacable sweet shadow of perfect sleep<br/>
That gives not back what life gives death to keep;<br/>
Yea, all that lived and loved and sang and sinned<br/>
Are all borne down death's cold sweet soundless wind</span>
That blows all night and knows not whom its breath,<br/>
Darkling, may touch to death:<br/>
But one that wind hath touched and changed not,&mdash;one<br/>
Whose body and soul are parcel of the sun;<br/>
One that earth's fire could burn not, nor the sea<br/>
Quench; nor might human doom take hold on thee;<br/>
All praise, all pity, all dreams have done thee wrong,<br/>
All love, with eyes love-blinded from above;<br/>
Song's priestess, mad with joy and pain of love,<br/>
Love's priestess, mad with pain and joy of song.
</p>
<p>
Hast thou none other answer then for me<br/>
Than the air may have of thee,<br/>
Or the earth's warm woodlands girdling with green girth<br/>
Thy secret sleepless burning life on earth,<br/>
Or even the sea that once, being woman crowned<br/>
And girt with fire and glory of anguish round,<br/>
Thou wert so fain to seek to, fain to crave<br/>
If she would hear thee and save<br/>
And give thee comfort of thy great green grave?<br/>
Because I have known thee always who thou art,<br/>
Thou knowest, have known thee to thy heart's own heart,<br/>
Nor ever have given light ear to storied song<br/>
That did thy sweet name sweet unwitting wrong,<br/>
Nor ever have called thee nor would call for shame,<br/>
Thou knowest, but inly by thine only name,<br/>
Sappho&mdash;because I have known thee and loved, hast thou<br/>
None other answer now?<br/>
As brother and sister were we, child and bird,<br/>
Since thy first Lesbian word</span>
Flamed on me, and I knew not whence I knew<br/>
This was the song that struck my whole soul through,<br/>
Pierced my keen spirit of sense with edge more keen,<br/>
Even when I knew not,&mdash;even ere sooth was seen,&mdash;<br/>
When thou wast but the tawny sweet winged thing<br/>
Whose cry was but of spring.
</p>
<p>
And yet even so thine ear should hear me&mdash;yea,<br/>
Hear me this nightfall by this northland bay,<br/>
Even for their sake whose loud good word I had,<br/>
Singing of thee in the all-beloved clime<br/>
Once, where the windy wine of spring makes mad<br/>
Our sisters of Majano, who kept time<br/>
Clear to my choral rhyme.<br/>
Yet was the song acclaimed of these aloud<br/>
Whose praise had made mute humbleness misproud,<br/>
The song with answering song applauded thus,<br/>
But of that Daulian dream of Itylus.<br/>
So but for love's love haply was it&mdash;nay,<br/>
How else?&mdash;that even their song took my song's part,<br/>
For love of love and sweetness of sweet heart,<br/>
Or god-given glorious madness of mid May<br/>
And heat of heart and hunger and thirst to sing,<br/>
Full of the new wine of the wind of spring.
</p>
<p>
Or if this were not, and it be not sin<br/>
To hold myself in spirit of thy sweet kin,<br/>
In heart and spirit of song;<br/>
If this my great love do thy grace no wrong,<br/>
Thy grace that gave me grace to dwell therein;<br/>
If thy gods thus be my gods, and their will<br/>
Made my song part of thy song&mdash;even such part<br/>
As man's hath of God's heart&mdash;<br/>
And my life like as thy life to fulfil;</span>
What have our gods then given us? Ah, to thee,<br/>
Sister, much more, much happier than to me,<br/>
Much happier things they have given, and more of grace<br/>
Than falls to man's light race;<br/>
For lighter are we, all our love and pain<br/>
Lighter than thine, who knowest of time or place<br/>
Thus much, that place nor time<br/>
Can heal or hurt or lull or change again<br/>
The singing soul that makes his soul sublime<br/>
Who hears the far fall of its fire-fledged rhyme<br/>
Fill darkness as with bright and burning rain<br/>
Till all the live gloom inly glows, and light<br/>
Seems with the sound to cleave the core of night.
</p>
<p>
The singing soul that moves thee, and that moved<br/>
When thou wast woman, and their songs divine<br/>
Who mixed for Grecian mouths heaven's lyric wine<br/>
Fell dumb, fell down reproved<br/>
Before one sovereign Lesbian song of thine.<br/>
That soul, though love and life had fain held fast,<br/>
Wind-winged with fiery music, rose and past<br/>
Through the indrawn hollow of earth and heaven and hell,<br/>
As through some strait sea-shell<br/>
The wide sea's immemorial song,&mdash;the sea<br/>
That sings and breathes in strange men's ears of thee<br/>
How in her barren bride-bed, void and vast,<br/>
Even thy soul sang itself to sleep at last.
</p>
<p>
To sleep? Ah, then, what song is this, that here<br/>
Makes all the night one ear,<br/>
One ear fulfilled and mad with music, one<br/>
Heart kindling as the heart of heaven, to hear<br/>
A song more fiery than the awakening sun</span>
Sings, when his song sets fire<br/>
To the air and clouds that build the dead night's pyre?<br/>
<em>O thou of divers-coloured mind, O thou</em><br/>
<em>Deathless, God's daughter subtle-souled</em>&mdash;lo, now,<br/>
Now too the song above all songs, in flight<br/>
Higher than the day-star's height,<br/>
And sweet as sound the moving wings of night!<br/>
<em>Thou of the divers-coloured seat</em>&mdash;behold,<br/>
Her very song of old!&mdash;<br/>
<em>O deathless, O God's daughter subtle-souled!</em><br/>
That same cry through this boskage overhead<br/>
Rings round reiterated,<br/>
Palpitates as the last palpitated,<br/>
The last that panted through her lips and died<br/>
Not down this grey north sea's half sapped cliff-side<br/>
That crumbles toward the coastline, year by year<br/>
More near the sands and near;<br/>
The last loud lyric fiery cry she cried,<br/>
Heard once on heights Leucadian,&mdash;heard not here.
</p>
<p>
Not here; for this that fires our northland night,<br/>
This is the song that made<br/>
Love fearful, even the heart of love afraid,<br/>
With the great anguish of its great delight.<br/>
No swan-song, no far-fluttering half-drawn breath,<br/>
No word that love of love's sweet nature saith,<br/>
No dirge that lulls the narrowing lids of death,<br/>
No healing hymn of peace-prevented strife,&mdash;<br/>
This is her song of life.
</p>
<p>
<em>I loved thee</em>,&mdash;hark, one tenderer note than all&mdash;<br/>
<em>Atthis, of old time, once</em>&mdash;one low long fall,<br/>
Sighing&mdash;one long low lovely loveless call,</span>
Dying&mdash;one pause in song so flamelike fast&mdash;<br/>
<em>Atthis, long since in old time overpast</em>&mdash;<br/>
One soft first pause and last.<br/>
One,&mdash;then the old rage of rapture's fieriest rain<br/>
Storms all the music-maddened night again.
</p>
<p>
<em>Child of God, close craftswoman, I beseech thee,</em><br/>
<em>Bid not ache nor agony break nor master,</em><br/>
<em>Lady, my spirit</em>&mdash;<br/>
O thou her mistress, might her cry not reach thee?<br/>
Our Lady of all men's loves, could Love go past her,<br/>
Pass, and not hear it?
</p>
<p>
She hears not as she heard not; hears not me,<br/>
O treble-natured mystery,&mdash;how should she<br/>
Hear, or give ear?&mdash;who heard and heard not thee;<br/>
Heard, and went past, and heard not; but all time<br/>
Hears all that all the ravin of his years<br/>
Hath cast not wholly out of all men's ears<br/>
And dulled to death with deep dense funeral chime<br/>
Of their reiterate rhyme.<br/>
And now of all songs uttering all her praise,<br/>
All hers who had thy praise and did thee wrong,<br/>
Abides one song yet of her lyric days,<br/>
Thine only, this thy song.
</p>
<p>
O soul triune, woman and god and bird,<br/>
Man, man at least has heard.<br/>
All ages call thee conqueror, and thy cry<br/>
The mightiest as the least beneath the sky<br/>
Whose heart was ever set to song, or stirred<br/>
With wind of mounting music blown more high<br/>
Than wildest wing may fly,<br/>
Hath heard or hears,&mdash;even &AElig;schylus as I.</span>
But when thy name was woman, and thy word<br/>
Human,&mdash;then haply, surely then meseems<br/>
This thy bird's note was heard on earth of none,<br/>
Of none save only in dreams.<br/>
In all the world then surely was but one<br/>
Song; as in heaven at highest one sceptred sun<br/>
Regent, on earth here surely without fail<br/>
One only, one imperious nightingale.<br/>
Dumb was the field, the woodland mute, the lawn<br/>
Silent; the hill was tongueless as the vale<br/>
Even when the last fair waif of cloud that felt<br/>
Its heart beneath the colouring moonrays melt,<br/>
At high midnoon of midnight half withdrawn,<br/>
Bared all the sudden deep divine moondawn.<br/>
Then, unsaluted by her twin-born tune,<br/>
That latter timeless morning of the moon<br/>
Rose past its hour of moonrise; clouds gave way<br/>
To the old reconquering ray,<br/>
But no song answering made it more than day;<br/>
No cry of song by night<br/>
Shot fire into the cloud-constraining light.<br/>
One only, one &AElig;olian island heard<br/>
Thrill, but through no bird's throat,<br/>
In one strange manlike maiden's godlike note,<br/>
The song of all these as a single bird.<br/>
Till the sea's portal was as funeral gate<br/>
For that sole singer in all time's ageless date<br/>
Singled and signed for so triumphal fate,<br/>
All nightingales but one in all the world<br/>
All her sweet life were silent; only then,<br/>
When her life's wing of womanhood was furled,<br/>
Their cry, this cry of thine was heard again,<br/>
As of me now, of any born of men.</span>
Through sleepless clear spring nights filled full of thee,<br/>
Rekindled here, thy ruling song has thrilled<br/>
The deep dark air and subtle tender sea<br/>
And breathless hearts with one bright sound fulfilled.<br/>
Or at midnoon to me<br/>
Swimming, and birds about my happier head<br/>
Skimming, one smooth soft way by water and air,<br/>
To these my bright born brethren and to me<br/>
Hath not the clear wind borne or seemed to bear<br/>
A song wherein all earth and heaven and sea<br/>
Were molten in one music made of thee<br/>
To enforce us, O our sister of the shore,<br/>
Look once in heart back landward and adore?<br/>
For songless were we sea-mews, yet had we<br/>
More joy than all things joyful of thee&mdash;more,<br/>
Haply, than all things happiest; nay, save thee,<br/>
In thy strong rapture of imperious joy<br/>
Too high for heart of sea-borne bird or boy,<br/>
What living things were happiest if not we?<br/>
But knowing not love nor change nor wrath nor wrong,<br/>
No more we knew of song.
</p>
<p>
Song, and the secrets of it, and their might,<br/>
What blessings curse it and what curses bless,<br/>
I know them since my spirit had first in sight,<br/>
Clear as thy song's words or the live sun's light,<br/>
The small dark body's Lesbian loveliness<br/>
That held the fire eternal; eye and ear<br/>
Were as a god's to see, a god's to hear,<br/>
Through all his hours of daily and nightly chime,<br/>
The sundering of the two-edged spear of time:</span>
The spear that pierces even the sevenfold shields<br/>
Of mightiest Memory, mother of all songs made,<br/>
And wastes all songs as roseleaves kissed and frayed<br/>
As here the harvest of the foam-flowered fields;<br/>
But thine the spear may waste not that he wields<br/>
Since first the God whose soul is man's live breath,<br/>
The sun whose face hath our sun's face for shade,<br/>
Put all the light of life and love and death<br/>
Too strong for life, but not for love too strong,<br/>
Where pain makes peace with pleasure in thy song,<br/>
And in thine heart, where love and song make strife,<br/>
Fire everlasting of eternal life.

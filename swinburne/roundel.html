<h1>The Roundel</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
A roundel is wrought as a ring or a starbright sphere,<br/>
With craft of delight and with cunning of sound unsought,<br/>
That the heart of the hearer may smile if to pleasure his ear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A roundel is wrought.
</p>
<p>
Its jewel of music is carven of all or of aught&mdash;<br/>
Love, laughter, or mourning&mdash;remembrance of rapture or fear&mdash;<br/>
That fancy may fashion to hang in the ear of thought.
</p>
<p>
As a bird's quick song runs round, and the hearts in us hear<br/>
Pause answer to pause, and again the same strain caught,<br/>
So moves the device whence, round as a pearl or tear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A roundel is wrought.

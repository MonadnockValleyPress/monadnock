<h1>Music: An Ode</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it light that spake from the darkness, or music that shone from the word,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night was enkindled with sound of the sun or the first-born bird?<br/>
Souls enthralled and entrammelled in bondage of seasons that fall and rise,<br/>
Bound fast round with the fetters of flesh, and blinded with light that dies,<br/>
Lived not surely till music spake, and the spirit of life was heard.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Music, sister of sunrise, and herald of life to be,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiled as dawn on the spirit of man, and the thrall was free.<br/>
Slave of nature and serf of time, the bondman of life and death,<br/>
Dumb with passionless patience that breathed but forlorn and reluctant breath,<br/>
Heard, beheld, and his soul made answer, and communed aloud with the sea.
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Morning spake, and he heard: and the passionate silent noon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept for him not silence: and soft from the mounting moon<br/>
Fell the sound of her splendour, heard as dawn's in the breathless night,<br/>
Not of men but of birds whose note bade man's soul quicken and leap to light:<br/>
And the song of it spake, and the light and the darkness of earth were as chords in tune.

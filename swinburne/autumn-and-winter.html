<h1>Autumn and Winter</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p>
Three months bade wane and wax the wintering moon<br/>
Between two dates of death, while men were fain<br/>
Yet of the living light that all too soon<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Three months bade wane.
</p>
<p>
Cold autumn, wan with wrath of wind and rain,<br/>
Saw pass a soul sweet as the sovereign tune<br/>
That death smote silent when he smote again.
</p>
<p>
First went my friend, in life's mid light of noon,<br/>
Who loved the lord of music: then the strain<br/>
Whence earth was kindled like as heaven in June<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Three months bade wane.
</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>
A herald soul before its master's flying<br/>
Touched by some few moons first the darkling goal<br/>
Where shades rose up to greet the shade, espying<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A herald soul;
</p>
<p>
Shades of dead lords of music, who control<br/>
Men living by the might of men undying,<br/>
With strength of strains that make delight of dole.
</p>
<p>
The deep dense dust on death's dim threshold lying<br/>
Trembled with sense of kindling sound that stole<br/>
Through darkness, and the night gave ear, descrying<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A herald soul.
</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>
One went before, one after, but so fast<br/>
They seem gone hence together, from the shore<br/>
Whence we now gaze: yet ere the mightier passed<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One went before;
</p>
<p>
One whose whole heart of love, being set of yore<br/>
On that high joy which music lends us, cast<br/>
Light round him forth of music's radiant store.
</p>
<p>
Then went, while earth on winter glared aghast,<br/>
The mortal god he worshipped, through the door<br/>
Wherethrough so late, his lover to the last,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One went before.
</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p>
A star had set an hour before the sun<br/>
Sank from the skies wherethrough his heart's pulse yet<br/>
Thrills audibly: but few took heed, or none,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A star had set.
</p>
<p>
All heaven rings back, sonorous with regret,<br/>
The deep dirge of the sunset: how should one<br/>
Soft star be missed in all the concourse met?
</p>
<p>
But, O sweet single heart whose work is done,<br/>
Whose songs are silent, how should I forget<br/>
That ere the sunset's fiery goal was won<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A star had set?

<h1>The Afterglow of Shakespeare</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
Let there be light, said Time: and England heard:<br/>
And manhood grew to godhead at the word.<br/>
No light had shone, since earth arose from sleep,<br/>
So far; no fire of thought had cloven so deep.<br/>
A day beyond all days bade life acclaim<br/>
Shakespeare: and man put on his crowning name.<br/>
All secrets once through darkling ages kept<br/>
Shone, sang, and smiled to think how long they slept.<br/>
Man rose past fear of lies whereon he trod:<br/>
And Dante's ghost saw hell devour his God.<br/>
Bright Marlowe, brave as winds that brave the sea<br/>
When sundawn bids their bliss in battle be,<br/>
Lit England first along the ways whereon<br/>
Song brighter far than sunlight soared and shone.<br/>
He died ere half his life had earned his right<br/>
To lighten time with song's triumphant light.<br/>
Hope shrank, and felt the stroke at heart: but one<br/>
She knew not rose, a man to match the sun.<br/>
And England's hope and time's and man's became<br/>
Joy, deep as music's heart and keen as flame.<br/>
Not long, for heaven on earth may live not long,<br/>
Light sang, and darkness died before the song.<br/>
He passed, the man above all men, whose breath<br/>
Transfigured life with speech that lightens death.<br/>
He passed: but yet for many a lustrous year<br/>
His light of song bade England shine and hear.<br/>
As plague and fire and faith in falsehood spread,<br/>
So from the man of men, divine and dead,<br/>
Contagious godhead, seen, unknown, and heard,<br/>
Fulfilled and quickened England; thought and word,<br/>
When men would fain set life to music, grew<br/>
More sweet than years which knew not Shakespeare knew.<br/>
The simplest soul that set itself to song<br/>
Sang, and may fear not time's or change's wrong.<br/>
The lightest eye that glanced on life could see<br/>
Through grief and joy the God that man might be.<br/>
All passion whence the living soul takes fire<br/>
Till death fulfil despair and quench desire,<br/>
All love that lightens through the cloud of chance,<br/>
All hate that lurks in hope and smites askance,<br/>
All holiness of sorrow, all divine<br/>
Pity, whose tears are stars that save and shine,<br/>
All sunbright strength of laughter like the sea's<br/>
When spring and autumn loose their lustrous breeze,<br/>
All sweet, all strange, all sad, all glorious things,<br/>
Lived on his lips, and hailed him king of kings.<br/>
All thought, all strife, all anguish, all delight,<br/>
Spake all he bade, and speak till day be night.<br/>
No soul that heard, no spirit that beheld,<br/>
Knew not the God that lured them and compelled.<br/>
On Beaumont's brow the sun arisen afar<br/>
Shed fire which lit through heaven the younger star<br/>
That sank before the sunset: one dark spring<br/>
Slew first the kinglike subject, then the king.<br/>
The glory left above their graves made strong<br/>
The heart of Fletcher, till the flower-sweet song<br/>
That Shakespeare culled from Chaucer's field, and died,<br/>
Found ending on his lips that smiled and sighed.<br/>
From Dekker's eyes the light of tear-touched mirth<br/>
Shone as from Shakespeare's, mingling heaven and earth.<br/>
Wild witchcraft's lure and England's love made one<br/>
With Shakespeare's heart the heart of Middleton.<br/>
Harsh, homely, true, and tragic, Rowley told<br/>
His heart's debt down in rough and radiant gold.<br/>
The skies that Tourneur's lightning clove and rent<br/>
Flamed through the clouds where Shakespeare's thunder went.<br/>
Wise Massinger bade kings be wise in vain<br/>
Ere war bade song, storm-stricken, cower and wane.<br/>
Kind Heywood, simple-souled and single-eyed,<br/>
Found voice for England's home-born praise and pride.<br/>
Strange grief, strange love, strange terror, bared the sword<br/>
That smote the soul by grace and will of Ford.<br/>
The stern grim strength of Chapman's thought found speech<br/>
Loud as when storm at ebb-tide rends the beach:<br/>
And all the honey brewed from flowers in May<br/>
Made sweet the lips and bright the dreams of Day.<br/>
But even as Shakespeare caught from Marlowe's word<br/>
Fire, so from his the thunder-bearing third,<br/>
Webster, took light and might whence none but he<br/>
Hath since made song that sounded so the sea<br/>
Whose waves are lives of men&mdash;whose tidestream rolls<br/>
From year to darkening year the freight of souls.<br/>
Alone above it, sweet, supreme, sublime,<br/>
Shakespeare attunes the jarring chords of time;<br/>
Alone of all whose doom is death and birth,<br/>
Shakespeare is lord of souls alive on earth.

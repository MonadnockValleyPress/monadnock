<h1>Dedication</h1>
<h2>by Algernon Charles Swinburne</h2>
<p>
The sea gives her shells to the shingle,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth gives her streams to the sea:<br/>
They are many, but my gift is single,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My verses, the firstfruits of me.<br/>
Let the wind take the green and the grey leaf,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast forth without fruit upon air;<br/>
Take rose-leaf and vine-leaf and bay-leaf<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blown loose from the hair.
</p>
<p>
The night shakes them round me in legions,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn drives them before her like dreams;<br/>
Time sheds them like snows on strange regions,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swept shoreward on infinite streams;<br/>
Leaves pallid and sombre and ruddy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead fruits of the fugitive years;<br/>
Some stained as with wine and made bloody,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some as with tears.
</p>
<p>
Some scattered in seven years' traces,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they fell from the boy that was then;<br/>
Long left among idle green places,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or gathered but now among men;<br/>
On seas full of wonder and peril,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blown white round the capes of the north;<br/>
Or in islands where myrtles are sterile<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loves bring not forth.
</p>
<p>
O daughters of dreams and of stories<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That life is not wearied of yet,<br/>
Faustine, Fragoletta, Dolores,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F&eacute;lise and Yolande and Juliette,<br/>
Shall I find you not still, shall I miss you,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When sleep, that is true or that seems,<br/>
Comes back to me hopeless to kiss you,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O daughters of dreams?
</p>
<p>
They are past as a slumber that passes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the dew of a dawn of old time;<br/>
More frail than the shadows on glasses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More fleet than a wave or a rhyme.<br/>
As the waves after ebb drawing seaward,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When their hollows are full of the night,<br/>
So the birds that flew singing to me-ward<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recede out of sight.
</p>
<p>
The songs of dead seasons, that wander<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On wings of articulate words;<br/>
Lost leaves that the shore-wind may squander,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light flocks of untameable birds;<br/>
Some sang to me dreaming in class-time<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And truant in hand as in tongue;<br/>
For the youngest were born of boy's pastime,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eldest are young.
</p>
<p>
Is there shelter while life in them lingers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there hearing for songs that recede,<br/>
Tunes touched from a harp with man's fingers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or blown with boy's mouth in a reed?<br/>
Is there place in the land of your labour,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there room in your world of delight,<br/>
Where change has not sorrow for neighbour<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And day has not night?
</p>
<p>
In their wings though the sea-wind yet quivers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you spare not a space for them there<br/>
Made green with the running of rivers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gracious with temperate air;<br/>
In the fields and the turreted cities,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That cover from sunshine and rain<br/>
Fair passions and bountiful pities<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loves without stain?
</p>
<p>
In a land of clear colours and stories,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a region of shadowless hours,<br/>
Where earth has a garment of glories<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a murmur of musical flowers;<br/>
In woods where the spring half uncovers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flush of her amorous face,<br/>
By the waters that listen for lovers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these is there place?
</p>
<p>
For the song-birds of sorrow, that muffle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their music as clouds do their fire:<br/>
For the storm-birds of passion, that ruffle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild wings in a wind of desire;<br/>
In the stream of the storm as it settles<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blown seaward, borne far from the sun,<br/>
Shaken loose on the darkness like petals<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropt one after one?
</p>
<p>
Though the world of your hands be more gracious<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lovelier in lordship of things<br/>
Clothed round by sweet art with the spacious<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm heaven of her imminent wings,<br/>
Let them enter, unfledged and nigh fainting,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the love of old loves and lost times;<br/>
And receive in your palace of painting<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This revel of rhymes.
</p>
<p>
Though the seasons of man full of losses<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make empty the years full of youth,<br/>
If but one thing be constant in crosses,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change lays not her hand upon truth;<br/>
Hopes die, and their tombs are for token<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the grief as the joy of them ends<br/>
Ere time that breaks all men has broken<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faith between friends.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Though the many lights dwindle to one light,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is help if the heaven has one;<br/>
Though the skies be discrowned of the sunlight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the earth dispossessed of the sun,<br/>
They have moonlight and sleep for repayment,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, refreshed as a bride and set free,<br/>
With stars and sea-winds in her raiment,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night sinks on the sea.<br/>

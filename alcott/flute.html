<h1>Thoreau's Flute</h1>
<h2>by Louisa May Alcott (1863)</h2>
<p>
We, sighing, said, "Our Pan is dead;<br/>
His pipe hangs mute beside the river; &mdash;<br/>
Around his wistful sunbeams quiver,<br/>
But Music's airy voice is fled.<br/>
Spring mourns as for untimely frost;<br/>
The bluebird chants a requiem;<br/>
The willow-blossom waits for him; &mdash;<br/>
The Genius of the wood is lost."
</p>
<p>
Then from the flute, untouched by hands,<br/>
There came a low, harmonious breath:<br/>
"For such as he there is no death; &mdash;<br/>
His life the eternal life commands;<br/>
Above man's aims his nature rose:<br/>
The wisdom of a just continent,<br/>
And tuned to poetry Life's prose.
</p>
<p>
"Haunting the hills, the stream, the wild,<br/>
Swallow and aster, lake and pine,<br/>
To him grew human or divine, &mdash;<br/>
Fit mates for this large-hearted child.<br/>
Such homage Nature ne'er forgets,<br/>
And yearly on the coverlid<br/>
'Neath which her darling lieth hid<br/>
Will write his name in violets.
</p>
<p>
"To him no vain regrets belong,<br/>
Whose soul, that finer instrument,<br/>
Gave to the world no poor lament,<br/>
But wood-notes ever sweet and strong.<br/>
O lonely friend! he still will be<br/>
A potent presence, though unseen, &mdash;<br/>
Steadfast, sagacious, and serene:<br/>
Seek not for him, &mdash; he is with thee."
</p>

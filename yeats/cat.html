<h1>The Cat and the Moon</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1919)</h2>
<p>
The cat went here and there<br/>
And the moon spun round like a top,<br/>
And the nearest kin of the moon<br/>
The creeping cat looked up.<br/>
Black Minnaloushe stared at the moon,<br/>
For wander and wail as he would<br/>
The pure cold light in the sky<br/>
Troubled his animal blood.<br/>
Minnaloushe runs in the grass,<br/>
Lifting his delicate feet.<br/>
Do you dance, Minnaloushe, do you dance?<br/>
When two close kindred meet<br/>
What better than call a dance,<br/>
Maybe the moon may learn,<br/>
Tired of that courtly fashion,<br/>
A new dance turn.<br/>
Minnaloushe creeps through the grass<br/>
From moonlit place to place,<br/>
The sacred moon overhead<br/>
Has taken a new phase.<br/>
Does Minnaloushe know that his pupils<br/>
Will pass from change to change,<br/>
And that from round to crescent,<br/>
From crescent to round they range?<br/>
Minnaloushe creeps through the grass<br/>
Alone, important and wise,<br/>
And lifts to the changing moon<br/>
His changing eyes.

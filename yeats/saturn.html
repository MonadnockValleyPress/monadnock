<h1>Under Saturn</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1921)</h2>
<p>
Do not because this day I have grown saturnine<br/>
Imagine that lost love, inseparable from my thought<br/>
Because I have no other youth, can make me pine;<br/>
For how should I forget the wisdom that you brought,<br/>
The comfort that you made? Although my wits have gone<br/>
On a fantastic ride, my horse's flanks are spurred<br/>
By childish memories of an old cross Pollexfen,<br/>
And of a Middleton, whose name you never heard,<br/>
And of a red-haired Yeats whose looks, although he died<br/>
Before my time, seem like a vivid memory.<br/>
You heard that labouring man who had served my people. He said<br/>
Upon the open road, near to the Sligo quay &mdash;<br/>
No, no, not said, but cried it out &mdash; 'You have come again,<br/>
And surely after twenty years it was time to come.'<br/>
I am thinking of a child's vow sworn in vain<br/>
Never to leave that valley his fathers called their home.

<h1>He Bids his Beloved Be at Peace</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1899)</h2>
<p>
I hear the Shadowy Horses, their long manes a-shake,<br/>
Their hoofs heavy with tumult, their eyes glimmering white;<br/>
The North unfolds above them clinging, creeping night,<br/>
The East her hidden joy before the morning break,<br/>
The West weeps in pale dew and sighs passing away,<br/>
The South is pouring down roses of crimson fire:<br/>
O vanity of Sleep, Hope, Dream, endless Desire,<br/>
The Horses of Disaster plunge in the heavy clay:<br/>
Beloved, let your eyes half close, and your heart beat<br/>
Over my heart, and your hair fall over my breast,<br/>
Drowning love's lonely hour in deep twilight of rest,<br/>
And hiding their tossing manes and their tumultuous feet.

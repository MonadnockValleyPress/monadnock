<h1>The Wild Swans at Coole</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1919)</h2>
<p>
The trees are in their autumn beauty,<br/>
The woodland paths are dry,<br/>
Under the October twilight the water<br/>
Mirrors a still sky;<br/>
Upon the brimming water among the stones<br/>
Are nine and fifty swans.
</p>
<p>
The nineteenth Autumn has come upon me<br/>
Since I first made my count;<br/>
I saw, before I had well finished,<br/>
All suddenly mount<br/>
And scatter wheeling in great broken rings<br/>
Upon their clamorous wings.
</p>
<p>
I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,<br/>
And now my heart is sore.<br/>
All's changed since I, hearing at twilight,<br/>
The first time on this shore,<br/>
The bell-beat of their wings above my head,<br/>
Trod with a lighter tread.
</p>
<p>
Unwearied still, lover by lover,<br/>
They paddle in the cold,<br/>
Companionable streams or climb the air;<br/>
Their hearts have not grown old;<br/>
Passion or conquest, wander where they will,<br/>
Attend upon them still.
</p>
<p>
But now they drift on the still water<br/>
Mysterious, beautiful;<br/>
Among what rushes will they build,<br/>
By what lake's edge or pool<br/>
Delight men's eyes, when I awake some day<br/>
To find they have flown away?

<h1>Peace</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1910)</h2>
<p>
Ah, that Time could touch a form<br/>
That could show what Homer's age<br/>
Bred to be a hero's wage.<br/>
"Were not all her life but storm,<br/>
Would not painters paint a form<br/>
Of such noble lines" I said.<br/>
"Such a delicate high head,<br/>
So much sternness and such charm,<br/>
Till they had changed us to like strength?"<br/>
Ah, but peace that comes at length,<br/>
Came when Time had touched her form.

<h1>A Prayer for my Daughter</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1921)</h2>
<p>
Once more the storm is howling, and half hid<br/>
Under this cradle-hood and coverlid<br/>
My child sleeps on. There is no obstacle<br/>
But Gregory's wood and one bare hill<br/>
Whereby the haystack- and roof-levelling wind,<br/>
Bred on the Atlantic, can be stayed;<br/>
And for an hour I have walked and prayed<br/>
Because of the great gloom that is in my mind.
</p>
<p>
I have walked and prayed for this young child an hour<br/>
And heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower,<br/>
And under the arches of the bridge, and scream<br/>
In the elms above the flooded stream;<br/>
Imagining in excited reverie<br/>
That the future years had come,<br/>
Dancing to a frenzied drum,<br/>
Out of the murderous innocence of the sea.
</p>
<p>
May she be granted beauty and yet not<br/>
Beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught,<br/>
Or hers before a looking-glass, for such,<br/>
Being made beautiful overmuch,<br/>
Consider beauty a sufficient end,<br/>
Lose natural kindness and maybe<br/>
The heart-revealing intimacy<br/>
That chooses right, and never find a friend.
</p>
<p>
Helen being chosen found life flat and dull<br/>
And later had much trouble from a fool,<br/>
While that great Queen, that rose out of the spray,<br/>
Being fatherless could have her way<br/>
Yet chose a bandy-legg√®d smith for man.<br/>
It's certain that fine women eat<br/>
A crazy salad with their meat<br/>
Whereby the Horn of Plenty is undone.
</p>
<p>
In courtesy I'd have her chiefly learned;<br/>
Hearts are not had as a gift but hearts are earned<br/>
By those that are not entirely beautiful;<br/>
Yet many, that have played the fool<br/>
For beauty's very self, has charm made wise,<br/>
And many a poor man that has roved,<br/>
Loved and thought himself beloved,<br/>
From a glad kindness cannot take his eyes.
</p>
<p>
May she become a flourishing hidden tree<br/>
That all her thoughts may like the linnet be,<br/>
And have no business but dispensing round<br/>
Their magnanimities of sound,<br/>
Nor but in merriment begin a chase,<br/>
Nor but in merriment a quarrel.<br/>
O may she live like some green laurel<br/>
Rooted in one dear perpetual place.
</p>
<p>
My mind, because the minds that I have loved,<br/>
The sort of beauty that I have approved,<br/>
Prosper but little, has dried up of late,<br/>
Yet knows that to be choked with hate<br/>
May well be of all evil chances chief.<br/>
If there's no hatred in a mind<br/>
Assault and battery of the wind<br/>
Can never tear the linnet from the leaf.
</p>
<p>
An intellectual hatred is the worst,<br/>
So let her think opinions are accursed.<br/>
Have I not seen the loveliest woman born<br/>
Out of the mouth of Plenty's horn,<br/>
Because of her opinionated mind<br/>
Barter that horn and every good<br/>
By quiet natures understood<br/>
For an old bellows full of angry wind?
</p>
<p>
Considering that, all hatred driven hence,<br/>
The soul recovers radical innocence<br/>
And learns at last that it is self-delighting,<br/>
Self-appeasing, self-affrighting,<br/>
And that its own sweet will is Heaven's will;<br/>
She can, though every face should scowl<br/>
And every windy quarter howl<br/>
Or every bellows burst, be happy still.
</p>
<p>
And may her bridegroom bring her to a house<br/>
Where all's accustomed, ceremonious;<br/>
For arrogance and hatred are the wares<br/>
Peddled in the thoroughfares.<br/>
How but in custom and in ceremony<br/>
Are innocence and beauty born?<br/>
Ceremony's a name for the rich horn,<br/>
And custom for the spreading laurel tree.

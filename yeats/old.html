<h1>When You Are Old</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1893)</h2>
<p>
When you are old and gray and full of sleep,<br/>
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,<br/>
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look<br/>
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;
</p>
<p>
How many loved your moments of glad grace,<br/>
And loved your beauty will love false or true;<br/>
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,<br/>
And loved the sorrows of your changing face.
</p>
<p>
And bending down beside the glowing bars<br/>
Murmur, a little sadly, how love fled<br/>
And paced upon the mountains overhead<br/>
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.

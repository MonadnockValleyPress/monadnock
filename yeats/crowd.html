<h1>The Leaders of the Crowd</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1921)</h2>
<p>
They must to keep their certainty accuse<br/>
All that are different of a base intent;<br/>
Pull down established honour; hawk for news<br/>
Whatever their loose fantasy invent<br/>
And murmur it with bated breath, as though<br/>
The abounding gutter had been Helicon<br/>
Or calumny a song. How can they know<br/>
Truth flourishes where the student's lamp has shone,<br/>
And there alone, that have no Solitude?<br/>
So the crowd come they care not what may come.<br/>
They have loud music, hope every day renewed<br/>
And heartier loves; that lamp is from the tomb.

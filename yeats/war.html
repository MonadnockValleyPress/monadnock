<h1>On Being Asked for a War Poem</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1919)</h2>
<p>
I think it better that in times like these<br/>
A poet keep his mouth shut, for in truth<br/>
We have no gift to set a statesman right;<br/>
He has had enough of meddling who can please<br/>
A young girl in the indolence of her youth,<br/>
Or an old man upon a winter's night.

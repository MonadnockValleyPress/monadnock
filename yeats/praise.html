<h1>Against Unworthy Praise</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1910)</h2>
<p>
O heart, be at peace, because<br/>
Nor knave nor dolt can break<br/>
What's not for their applause,<br/>
Being for a woman's sake.<br/>
Enough if the work has seemed,<br/>
So did she your strength renew,<br/>
A dream that a lion had dreamed<br/>
Till the wilderness cried aloud,<br/>
A secret between you two,<br/>
Between the proud and the proud.
</p>
<p>
What, still you would have their praise!<br/>
But here's a haughtier text,<br/>
The labyrinth of her days<br/>
That her own strangeness perplexed;<br/>
And how what her dreaming gave<br/>
Earned slander, ingratitude,<br/>
From self-same dolt and knave;<br/>
Aye, and worse wrong than these.<br/>
Yet she, singing upon her road,<br/>
Half lion, half child, is at peace.

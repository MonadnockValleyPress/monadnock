<h1>An Irish Airman Foresees His Death</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1919)</h2>
<p>
I know that I shall meet my fate<br/>
Somewhere among the clouds above;<br/>
Those that I fight I do not hate<br/>
Those that I guard I do not love;<br/>
My country is Kiltartan Cross,<br/>
My countrymen Kiltartan's poor,<br/>
No likely end could bring them loss<br/>
Or leave them happier than before.<br/>
Nor law, nor duty bade me fight,<br/>
Nor public men, nor cheering crowds,<br/>
A lonely impulse of delight<br/>
Drove to this tumult in the clouds;<br/>
I balanced all, brought all to mind,<br/>
The years to come seemed waste of breath,<br/>
A waste of breath the years behind<br/>
In balance with this life, this death.

<h1>The Heart of the Woman</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1899)</h2>
<p>
O what to me the little room<br/>
That was brimmed up with prayer and rest;<br/>
He bade me out into the gloom,<br/>
And my breast lies upon his breast.
</p>
<p>
O what to me my mother's care,<br/>
The house where I was safe and warm;<br/>
The shadowy blossom of my hair<br/>
Will hide us from the bitter storm.
</p>
<p>
O hiding hair and dewy eyes,<br/>
I am no more with life and death,<br/>
My heart upon his warm heart lies,<br/>
My breath is mixed into his breath.
</p>

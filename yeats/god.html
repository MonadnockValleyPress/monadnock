<h1>The Indian upon God</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1889)</h2>
<p>
I passed along the water's edge below the humid trees,<br/>
My spirit rocked in evening light, the rushes round my knees,<br/>
My spirit rocked in sleep and sighs; and saw the moorfowl pace<br/>
All dripping on a grassy slope, and saw them cease to chase<br/>
Each other round in circles, and heard the eldest speak:<br/>
<em>Who holds the world between His bill and made us strong or weak</em><br/>
<em>Is an undying moorfowl, and He lives beyond the sky.</em><br/>
<em>The rains are from His dripping wing, the moonbeams from His eye.</em><br/>
I passed a little further on and heard a lotus talk:<br/>
<em>Who made the world and ruleth it, He hangeth on a stalk,</em><br/>
<em>For I am in His image made, and all this tinkling tide</em><br/>
<em>Is but a sliding drop of rain between His petals wide.</em><br/>
A little way within the gloom a roebuck raised his eyes<br/>
Brimful of starlight, and he said: <em>The Stamper of the Skies,</em><br/>
<em>He is a gentle roebuck; for how else, I pray, could He</em><br/>
<em>Conceive a thing so sad and soft, a gentle thing like me?</em><br/>
I passed a little further on and heard a peacock say:<br/>
<em>Who made the grass and made the worms and made my feathers gay,</em><br/>
<em>He is a monstrous peacock, and He waveth all the night</em><br/>
<em>His languid tail above us, lit with myriad spots of light.</em>

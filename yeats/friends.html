<h1>Friends</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1914)</h2>
<p>
Now must I these three praise&mdash;<br/>
Three women that have wrought<br/>
What joy is in my days;<br/>
One that no passing thought,<br/>
Nor those unpassing cares,<br/>
No, not in these fifteen<br/>
Many times troubled years,<br/>
Could ever come between<br/>
Heart and delighted heart;<br/>
And one because her hand<br/>
Had strength that could unbind<br/>
What none can understand,<br/>
What none can have and thrive,<br/>
Youth's dreamy load, till she<br/>
So changed me that I live<br/>
Labouring in ecstasy.<br/>
And what of her that took<br/>
All till my youth was gone<br/>
With scarce a pitying look?<br/>
How should I praise that one?<br/>
When day begins to break<br/>
I count my good and bad,<br/>
Being wakeful for her sake,<br/>
Remembering what she had,<br/>
What eagle look still shows,<br/>
While up from my heart's root<br/>
So great a sweetness flows<br/>
I shake from head to foot.

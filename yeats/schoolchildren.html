<h1>Among School Children</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1928)</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
I walk through the long schoolroom questioning;<br/>
A kind old nun in a white hood replies;<br/>
The children learn to cipher and to sing,<br/>
To study reading-books and history,<br/>
To cut and sew, be neat in everything<br/>
In the best modern way&mdash;the children's eyes<br/>
In momentary wonder stare upon<br/>
A sixty-year-old smiling public man.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
I dream of a Ledaean body, bent<br/>
Above a sinking fire, a tale that she<br/>
Told of a harsh reproof, or trivial event<br/>
That changed some childish day to tragedy&mdash;<br/>
Told, and it seemed that our two natures blent<br/>
Into a sphere from youthful sympathy,<br/>
Or else, to alter Plato's parable,<br/>
Into the yolk and white of the one shell.
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
And thinking of that fit of grief or rage<br/>
I look upon one child or t'other there<br/>
And wonder if she stood so at that age&mdash;<br/>
For even daughters of the swan can share<br/>
Something of every paddler's heritage&mdash;<br/>
And had that colour upon cheek or hair,<br/>
And thereupon my heart is driven wild:<br/>
She stands before me as a living child.
</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>
Her present image floats into the mind&mdash;<br/>
Did Quattrocento finger fashion it<br/>
Hollow of cheek as though it drank the wind<br/>
And took a mess of shadows for its meat?<br/>
And I though never of Ledaean kind<br/>
Had pretty plumage once&mdash;enough of that,<br/>
Better to smile on all that smile, and show<br/>
There is a comfortable kind of old scarecrow.
</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>
What youthful mother, a shape upon her lap<br/>
Honey of generation had betrayed,<br/>
And that must sleep, shriek, struggle to escape<br/>
As recollection or the drug decide,<br/>
Would think her son, did she but see that shape<br/>
With sixty or more winters on its head,<br/>
A compensation for the pang of his birth,<br/>
Or the uncertainty of his setting forth?
</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>
Plato thought nature but a spume that plays<br/>
Upon a ghostly paradigm of things;<br/>
Solider Aristotle played the taws<br/>
Upon the bottom of a king of kings;<br/>
World-famous golden-thighed Pythagoras<br/>
Fingered upon a fiddle-stick or strings<br/>
What a star sang and careless Muses heard:<br/>
Old clothes upon old sticks to scare a bird.
</p>
<h3>VII</h3>
<p>
Both nuns and mothers worship images,<br/>
But those the candles light are not as those<br/>
That animate a mother's reveries,<br/>
But keep a marble or a bronze repose.<br/>
And yet they too break hearts&mdash;O Presences<br/>
That passion, piety or affection knows,<br/>
And that all heavenly glory symbolise&mdash;<br/>
O self-born mockers of man's enterprise;
</p>
<h3>VIII</h3>
<p>
Labour is blossoming or dancing where<br/>
The body is not bruised to pleasure soul,<br/>
Nor beauty born out of its own despair,<br/>
Nor blear-eyed wisdom out of midnight oil.<br/>
O chestnut tree, great rooted blossomer,<br/>
Are you the leaf, the blossom or the bole?<br/>
O body swayed to music, O brightening glance,<br/>
How can we know the dancer from the dance?

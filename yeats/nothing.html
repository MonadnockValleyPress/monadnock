<h1>To a Friend Whose Work Has Come to Nothing</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1914)</h2>
<p>
Now all the truth is out,<br/>
Be secret and take defeat<br/>
From any brazen throat,<br/>
For how can you compete,<br/>
Being honour bred, with one<br/>
Who, were it proved he lies,<br/>
Were neither shamed in his own<br/>
Nor in his neighbours' eyes?<br/>
Bred to a harder thing<br/>
Than Triumph, turn away<br/>
And like a laughing string<br/>
Whereon mad fingers play<br/>
Amid a place of stone,<br/>
Be secret and exult,<br/>
Because of all things known<br/>
That is most difficult.

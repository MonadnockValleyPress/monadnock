<h1>A Poet to His Beloved</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1899)</h2>
<p>
I bring you with reverent hands<br/>
The books of my numberless dreams;<br/>
White woman that passion has worn<br/>
As the tide wears the dove-gray sands,<br/>
And with heart more old than the horn<br/>
That is brimmed from the pale fire of time:<br/>
White woman with numberless dreams<br/>
I bring you my passionate rhyme.

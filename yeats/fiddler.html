<h1>The Fiddler of Dooney</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1899)</h2>
<p>
When I play on my fiddle in Dooney<br/>
Folk dance like a wave of the sea<br/>
My cousin is priest in Kilvarnet<br/>
My brother in Moharabuiee
</p>
<p>
I passed my brother and cousin:<br/>
They read in their books of prayer;<br/>
I read in my book of songs<br/>
I bought at the Sligo fair.
</p>
<p>
When we come at the end of time,<br/>
To Peter sitting in state,<br/>
He will smile on the three old spirits,<br/>
But call me first through the gate;
</p>
<p>
For the good are always the merry,<br/>
Save by an evil chance,<br/>
And the merry love the fiddle<br/>
And the merry love to dance:
</p>
<p>
And when the folk there spy me,<br/>
They will all come up to me,<br/>
With 'Here is the fiddler of Dooney!'<br/>
And dance like a wave of the sea.

<h1>Never Give All the Heart</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1904)</h2>
<p>
Never give all the heart, for love<br/>
Will hardly seem worth thinking of<br/>
To passionate women if it seem<br/>
Certain, and they never dream<br/>
That it fades out from kiss to kiss;<br/>
For everything that's lovely is<br/>
But a brief dreamy kind delight.<br/>
O never give the heart outright,<br/>
For they, for all smooth lips can say,<br/>
Have given their hearts up to the play.<br/>
And who could play it well enough<br/>
If deaf and dumb and blind with love?<br/>
He that made this knows all the cost,<br/>
For he gave all his heart and lost.

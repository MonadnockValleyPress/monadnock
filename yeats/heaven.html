<h1>He Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1899)</h2>
<p>
Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,<br/>
Enwrought with golden and silver light,<br/>
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths<br/>
Of night and light and the half light,<br/>
I would spread the cloths under your feet:<br/>
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;<br/>
I have spread my dreams under your feet;<br/>
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.

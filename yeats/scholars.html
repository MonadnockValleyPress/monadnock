<h1>The Scholars</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1919)</h2>
<p>
Bald heads forgetful of their sins,<br/>
Old, learned, respectable bald heads<br/>
Edit and annotate the lines<br/>
That young men, tossing on their beds,<br/>
Rhymed out in love's despair<br/>
To flatter beauty's ignorant ear.
</p>
<p>
They'll cough in the ink to the world's end;<br/>
Wear out the carpet with their shoes<br/>
Earning respect; have no strange friend;<br/>
If they have sinned nobody knows.<br/>
Lord, what would they say<br/>
Should their Catullus walk that way?

<h1>The Second Coming</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1919)</h2>
<p>
Turning and turning in the widening gyre<br/>
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;<br/>
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br/>
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br/>
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere<br/>
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;<br/>
The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br/>
Are full of passionate intensity.
</p>
<p>
Surely some revelation is at hand;<br/>
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.<br/>
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out<br/>
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi<br/>
Troubles my sight: a waste of desert sand;<br/>
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,<br/>
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,<br/>
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it<br/>
Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.
</p>
<p>
The darkness drops again; but now I know<br/>
That twenty centuries of stony sleep<br/>
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,<br/>
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br/>
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?

<h1>The Folly of Being Comforted</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1904)</h2>
<p>
One that is ever kind said yesterday:<br/>
'Your well-beloved's hair has threads of grey,<br/>
And little shadows come about her eyes;<br/>
Time can but make it easier to be wise,<br/>
Though now it's hard, till trouble is at an end;<br/>
And so be patient, be wise and patient, friend.'<br/>
But, heart, there is no comfort, not a grain;<br/>
Time can but make her beauty over again,<br/>
Because of that great nobleness of hers;<br/>
The fire that stirs about her, when she stirs<br/>
Burns but more clearly. O she had not these ways,<br/>
When all the wild summer was in her gaze.<br/>
O heart! O heart! if she'd but turn her head,<br/>
You'd know the folly of being comforted.

<h1>A Song</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1919)</h2>
<p>
I thought no more was needed<br/>
Youth to prolong<br/>
Than dumb-bell and foil<br/>
To keep the body young.<br/>
Oh, who could have foretold<br/>
That the heart grows old?
</p>
<p>
Though I have many words,<br/>
What woman's satisfied,<br/>
I am no longer faint<br/>
Because at her side?<br/>
Oh, who could have foretold<br/>
That the heart grows old?
</p>
<p>
I have not lost desire<br/>
But the heart that I had,<br/>
I thought 'twould burn my body<br/>
Laid on the death-bed.<br/>
But who could have foretold<br/>
That the heart grows old?
</p>

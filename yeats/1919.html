<h1>Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1928)</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
Many ingenious lovely things are gone<br/>
That seemed sheer miracle to the multitude,<br/>
protected from the circle of the moon<br/>
That pitches common things about. There stood<br/>
Amid the ornamental bronze and stone<br/>
An ancient image made of olive wood&mdash;<br/>
And gone are Phidias' famous ivories<br/>
And all the golden grasshoppers and bees.
</p>
<p>
We too had many pretty toys when young:<br/>
A law indifferent to blame or praise,<br/>
To bribe or threat; habits that made old wrong<br/>
Melt down, as it were wax in the sun's rays;<br/>
Public opinion ripening for so long<br/>
We thought it would outlive all future days.<br/>
O what fine thought we had because we thought<br/>
That the worst rogues and rascals had died out.
</p>
<p>
All teeth were drawn, all ancient tricks unlearned,<br/>
And a great army but a showy thing;<br/>
What matter that no cannon had been turned<br/>
Into a ploughshare? Parliament and king<br/>
Thought that unless a little powder burned<br/>
The trumpeters might burst with trumpeting<br/>
And yet it lack all glory; and perchance<br/>
The guardsmen's drowsy chargers would not prance.
</p>
<p>
Now days are dragon-ridden, the nightmare<br/>
Rides upon sleep: a drunken soldiery<br/>
Can leave the mother, murdered at her door,<br/>
To crawl in her own blood, and go scot-free;<br/>
The night can sweat with terror as before<br/>
We pieced our thoughts into philosophy,<br/>
And planned to bring the world under a rule,<br/>
Who are but weasels fighting in a hole.
</p>
<p>
He who can read the signs nor sink unmanned<br/>
Into the half-deceit of some intoxicant<br/>
From shallow wits; who knows no work can stand,<br/>
Whether health, wealth or peace of mind were spent<br/>
On master-work of intellect or hand,<br/>
No honour leave its mighty monument,<br/>
Has but one comfort left: all triumph would<br/>
But break upon his ghostly solitude.
</p>
<p>
But is there any comfort to be found?<br/>
Man is in love and loves what vanishes,<br/>
What more is there to say? That country round<br/>
None dared admit, if such a thought were his,<br/>
Incendiary or bigot could be found<br/>
To burn that stump on the Acropolis,<br/>
Or break in bits the famous ivories<br/>
Or traffic in the grasshoppers or bees.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
When Loie Fuller's Chinese dancers enwound<br/>
A shining web, a floating ribbon of cloth,<br/>
It seemed that a dragon of air<br/>
Had fallen among dancers, had whirled them round<br/>
Or hurried them off on its own furious path;<br/>
So the Platonic Year<br/>
Whirls out new right and wrong,<br/>
Whirls in the old instead;<br/>
All men are dancers and their tread<br/>
Goes to the barbarous clangour of a gong.
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
Some moralist or mythological poet<br/>
Compares the solitary soul to a swan;<br/>
I am satisfied with that,<br/>
Satisfied if a troubled mirror show it,<br/>
Before that brief gleam of its life be gone,<br/>
An image of its state;<br/>
The wings half spread for flight,<br/>
The breast thrust out in pride<br/>
Whether to play, or to ride<br/>
Those winds that clamour of approaching night.
</p>
<p>
A man in his own secret meditation<br/>
Is lost amid the labyrinth that he has made<br/>
In art or politics;<br/>
Some Platonist affirms that in the station<br/>
Where we should cast off body and trade<br/>
The ancient habit sticks,<br/>
And that if our works could<br/>
But vanish with our breath<br/>
That were a lucky death,<br/>
For triumph can but mar our solitude.
</p>
<p>
The swan has leaped into the desolate heaven:<br/>
That image can bring wildness, bring a rage<br/>
To end all things, to end<br/>
What my laborious life imagined, even<br/>
The half-imagined, the half-written page;<br/>
O but we dreamed to mend<br/>
Whatever mischief seemed<br/>
To afflict mankind, but now<br/>
That winds of winter blow<br/>
Learn that we were crack-pated when we dreamed.
</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>
We, who seven years ago<br/>
Talked of honour and of truth,<br/>
Shriek with pleasure if we show<br/>
The weasel's twist, the weasel's tooth.
</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>
Come let us mock at the great<br/>
That had such burdens on the mind<br/>
And toiled so hard and late<br/>
To leave some monument behind,<br/>
Nor thought of the levelling wind.
</p>
<p>
Come let us mock at the wise;<br/>
With all those calendars whereon<br/>
They fixed old aching eyes,<br/>
They never saw how seasons run,<br/>
And now but gape at the sun.
</p>
<p>
Come let us mock at the good<br/>
That fancied goodness might be gay,<br/>
And sick of solitude<br/>
Might proclaim a holiday:<br/>
Wind shrieked&mdash;and where are they?
</p>
<p>
Mock mockers after that<br/>
That would not lift a hand maybe<br/>
To help good, wise or great<br/>
To bar that foul storm out, for we<br/>
Traffic in mockery.
</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>
Violence upon the roads: violence of horses;<br/>
Some few have handsome riders, are garlanded<br/>
On delicate sensitive ear or tossing mane,<br/>
But wearied running round and round in their courses<br/>
All break and vanish, and evil gathers head:<br/>
Herodias' daughters have returned again,<br/>
A sudden blast of dusty wind and after<br/>
Thunder of feet, tumult of images,<br/>
Their purpose in the labyrinth of the wind;<br/>
And should some crazy hand dare touch a daughter<br/>
All turn with amorous cries, or angry cries,<br/>
According to the wind, for all are blind.<br/>
But now wind drops, dust settles; thereupon<br/>
There lurches past, his great eyes without thought<br/>
Under the shadow of stupid straw-pale locks,<br/>
That insolent fiend Robert Artisson<br/>
To whom the love-lorn Lady Kyteler brought<br/>
Bronzed peacock feathers, red combs of her cocks.

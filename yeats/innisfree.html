<h1>The Lake Isle of Innisfree</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1893)</h2>
<p>
I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,<br/>
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made:<br/>
Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee,<br/>
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.
</p>
<p>
And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,<br/>
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;<br/>
There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,<br/>
And evening full of the linnet's wings.
</p>
<p>
I will arise and go now, for always night and day<br/>
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;<br/>
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements gray,<br/>
I hear it in the deep heart's core.

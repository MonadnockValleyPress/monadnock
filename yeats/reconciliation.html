<h1>Reconciliation</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1910)</h2>
<p>
Some may have blamed you that you took away<br/>
The verses that could move them on the day<br/>
When, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind<br/>
With lightning you went from me, and I could find<br/>
Nothing to make a song about but kings,<br/>
Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things<br/>
That were like memories of youâ€”but now<br/>
We'll out, for the world lives as long ago;<br/>
And while we're in our laughing, weeping fit,<br/>
Hurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit.<br/>
But, dear, cling close to me; since you were gone,<br/>
My barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone.

<h1>Sailing to Byzantium</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1928)</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>
That is no country for old men. The young<br/>
In one another's arms, birds in the trees,<br/>
&mdash;Those dying generations&mdash;at their song,<br/>
The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,<br/>
Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long<br/>
Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.<br/>
Caught in that sensual music all neglect<br/>
Monuments of unageing intellect.
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
An aged man is but a paltry thing,<br/>
A tattered coat upon a stick, unless<br/>
Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing<br/>
For every tatter in its mortal dress,<br/>
Nor is there singing school but studying<br/>
Monuments of its own magnificence;<br/>
And therefore I have sailed the seas and come<br/>
To the holy city of Byzantium.
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>
O sages standing in God's holy fire<br/>
As in the gold mosaic of a wall,<br/>
Come from the holy fire, perne in a gyre,<br/>
And be the singing-masters of my soul.<br/>
Consume my heart away; sick with desire<br/>
And fastened to a dying animal<br/>
It knows not what it is; and gather me<br/>
Into the artifice of eternity.
</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>
Once out of nature I shall never take<br/>
My bodily form from any natural thing,<br/>
But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make<br/>
Of hammered gold and gold enamelling<br/>
To keep a drowsy Emperor awake;<br/>
Or set upon a golden bough to sing<br/>
To lords and ladies of Byzantium<br/>
Of what is past, or passing, or to come.

<h1>Men Improve with the Years</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1919)</h2>
<p>
I am worn out with dreams;<br/>
A weather-worn, marble triton<br/>
Among the streams;<br/>
And all day long I look<br/>
Upon this lady's beauty<br/>
As though I had found in book<br/>
A pictured beauty,<br/>
Pleased to have filled the eyes<br/>
Or the discerning ears,<br/>
Delighted to be but wise,<br/>
For men improve with the years;<br/>
And yet and yet<br/>
Is this my dream, or the truth?<br/>
O would that we had met<br/>
When I had my burning youth;<br/>
But I grow old among dreams,<br/>
A weather-worn, marble triton<br/>
Among the streams.

<h1>An Appointment</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1914)</h2>
<p>
Being out of heart with government<br/>
I took a broken root to fling<br/>
Where the proud, wayward squirrel went,<br/>
Taking delight that he could spring;<br/>
And he, with that low whinnying sound<br/>
That is like laughter, sprang again<br/>
And so to the other tree at a bound.<br/>
Nor the tame will, nor timid brain,<br/>
Bred that fierce tooth and cleanly limb<br/>
And threw him up to laugh on the bough;<br/>
No government appointed him.

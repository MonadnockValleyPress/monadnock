<h1>In Memory of Major Robert Gregory</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1919)</h2>
<p>
<h3>1</h3>
<p>
Now that we're almost settled in our house<br/>
I'll name the friends that cannot sup with us<br/>
Beside a fire of turf in the ancient tower,<br/>
And having talked to some late hour<br/>
Climb up the narrow winding stair to bed:<br/>
Discoverers of forgotten truth<br/>
Or mere companions of my youth,<br/>
All, all are in my thoughts to-night, being dead. 
</p>
<h3>2</h3>
<p>
Always we'd have the new friend meet the old,<br/>
And we are hurt if either friend seem cold,<br/>
And there is salt to lengthen out the smart<br/>
In the affections of our heart,<br/>
And quarrels are blown up upon that head;<br/>
But not a friend that I would bring<br/>
This night can set us quarrelling,<br/>
For all that come into my mind are dead.
</p>

<p>
Lionel Johnson comes the first to mind,<br/>
That loved his learning better than mankind,<br/>
Though courteous to the worst; much falling he<br/>
Brooded upon sanctity<br/>
Till all his Greek and Latin learning seemed<br/>
A long blast upon the horn that brought<br/>
A little nearer to his thought<br/>
A measureless consummation that he dreamed.
</p>
<h3>4</h3>
<p>
And that enquiring man John Synge comes next,<br/>
That dying chose the living world for text<br/>
And never could have rested in the tomb<br/>
But that, long travelling, he had come<br/>
Towards nightfall upon certain set apart<br/>
In a most desolate stony place,<br/>
Towards nightfall upon a race<br/>
Passionate and simple like his heart. 
</p>
<h3>5</h3>
<p>
And then I think of old George Pollexfen,<br/>
In muscular youth well known to Mayo men<br/>
For horsemanship at meets or at race-courses,<br/>
That could have shown how purebred horses<br/>
And solid men, for all their passion, live<br/>
But as the outrageous stars incline<br/>
By opposition, square and trine;<br/>
Having grown sluggish and contemplative.
</p>
<h3>6</h3>
<p>
They were my close companions many a year,<br/>
A portion of my mind and life, as it were,<br/>
And now their breathless faces seem to look<br/>
Out of some old picture-book;<br/>
I am accustomed to their lack of breath,<br/>
But not that my dear friend's dear son,<br/>
Our Sidney and our perfect man,<br/>
Could share in that discourtesy of death.
</p>
<h3>7</h3>
<p>
For all things the delighted eye now sees<br/>
Were loved by him; the old storm-broken trees<br/>
That cast their shadows upon road and bridge;<br/>
The tower set on the stream's edge;<br/>
The ford where drinking cattle make a stir<br/>
Nightly, and startled by that sound<br/>
The water-hen must change her ground;<br/>
He might have been your heartiest welcomer. 
</p>
<h3>8</h3>
<p>
When with the Galway foxhounds he would ride<br/>
From Castle Taylor to the Roxborough side<br/>
Or Esserkelly plain, few kept his pace;<br/>
At Mooneen he had leaped a place<br/>
So perilous that half the astonished meet<br/>
Had shut their eyes, and where was it<br/>
He rode a race without a bit?<br/>
And yet his mind outran the horses' feet.
</p>
<h3>9</h3>
<p>
We dreamed that a great painter had been born<br/>
To cold Clare rock and Galway rock and thorn,<br/>
To that stern colour and that delicate line<br/>
That are our secret discipline<br/>
Wherein the gazing heart doubles her might.<br/>
Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,<br/>
And yet he had the intensity<br/>
To have published all to be a world's delight.
</p>
<h3>10</h3>
<p>
What other could so well have counselled us<br/>
In all lovely intricacies of a house<br/>
As he that practised or that understood<br/>
All work in metal or in wood,<br/>
In moulded plaster or in carven stone?<br/>
Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,<br/>
And all he did done perfectly<br/>
As though he had but that one trade alone.
</p>
<h3>11</h3>
<p>
Some burn damp fagots, others may consume<br/>
The entire combustible world in one small room<br/>
As though dried straw, and if we turn about<br/>
The bare chimney is gone black out<br/>
Because the work had finished in that flare.<br/>
Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,<br/>
As 'twere all life's epitome.<br/>
What made us dream that he could comb grey hair?
</p>
<h3>12</h3>
<p>
I had thought, seeing how bitter is that wind<br/>
That shakes the shutter, to have brought to mind<br/>
All those that manhood tried, or childhood loved,<br/>
Or boyish intellect approved,<br/>
With some appropriate commentary on each;<br/>
Until imagination brought<br/>
A fitter welcome; but a thought<br/>
Of that late death took all my heart for speech.

<h1>The Lover Tells of the Rose in his Heart</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1899)</h2>
<p>
All things uncomely and broken, all things worn out and old,<br/>
The cry of a child by the roadway, the creak of a lumbering cart,<br/>
The heavy steps of the ploughman, splashing the wintry mould,<br/>
Are wronging your image that blossoms a rose in the deeps of my heart.
</p>
<p>
The wrong of unshapely things is a wrong too great to be told;<br/>
I hunger to build them anew and sit on a green knoll apart,<br/>
With the earth and the sky and the water, remade, like a casket of gold<br/>
For my dreams of your image that blossoms a rose in the deeps of my heart.
</p>

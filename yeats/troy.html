<h1>No Second Troy</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1910)</h2>
<p>
Why should I blame her that she filled my days<br/>
With misery, or that she would of late<br/>
Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,<br/>
Or hurled the little streets upon the great,<br/>
Had they but courage equal to desire?<br/>
What could have made her peaceful with a mind<br/>
That nobleness made simple as a fire,<br/>
With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind<br/>
That is not natural in an age like this,<br/>
Being high and solitary and most stern?<br/>
Why, what could she have done being what she is?<br/>
Was there another Troy for her to burn?

<h1>The Fisherman</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1919)</h2>
<p>
Although I can see him still,<br/>
The freckled man who goes<br/>
To a grey place on a hill<br/>
In grey Connemara clothes<br/>
At dawn to cast his flies,<br/>
It's long since I began<br/>
To call up to the eyes<br/>
This wise and simple man.<br/>
All day I'd looked in the face<br/>
What I had hoped 'twould be<br/>
To write for my own race<br/>
And the reality;<br/>
The living men that I hate,<br/>
The dead man that I loved,<br/>
The craven man in his seat,<br/>
The insolent unreproved,<br/>
And no knave brought to book<br/>
Who has won a drunken cheer,<br/>
The witty man and his joke<br/>
Aimed at the commonest ear,<br/>
The clever man who cries<br/>
The catch-cries of the clown,<br/>
The beating down of the wise<br/>
And great Art beaten down.
</p>
<p>
Maybe a twelvemonth since<br/>
Suddenly I began,<br/>
In scorn of this audience,<br/>
Imagining a man<br/>
And his sun-freckled face,<br/>
And grey Connemara cloth,<br/>
Climbing up to a place<br/>
Where stone is dark under froth,<br/>
And the down turn of his wrist<br/>
When the flies drop in the stream:<br/>
A man who does not exist,<br/>
A man who is but a dream;<br/>
And cried, 'Before I am old<br/>
I shall have written him one<br/>
Poem maybe as cold<br/>
And passionate as the dawn.'

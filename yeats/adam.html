<h1>Adam's Curse</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1904)</h2>
<p>
We sat together at one summer's end,<br/>
That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,<br/>
And you and I, and talked of poetry.
</p>
<p>
I said: 'A line will take us hours maybe;<br/>
Yet if it does not seem a moment's thought,<br/>
Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.<br/>
Better go down upon your marrow bones<br/>
And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones<br/>
Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;<br/>
For to articulate sweet sounds together<br/>
Is to work harder than all these, and yet<br/>
Be thought an idler by the noisy set<br/>
Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen<br/>
The martyrs call the world.'
</p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That woman then<br/>
Murmured with her young voice, for whose mild sake<br/>
There's many a one shall find out all heartache<br/>
In finding that it's young and mild and low:<br/>
'There is one thing that all we women know,<br/>
Although we never heard of it at school&mdash;<br/>
That we must labour to be beautiful.'
</p>
<p>
I said: 'It's certain there is no fine thing<br/>
Since Adam's fall but needs much labouring.<br/>
There have been lovers who thought love should be<br/>
So much compounded of high courtesy<br/>
That they would sigh and quote with learned looks<br/>
Precedents out of beautiful old books;<br/>
Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.'
</p>
<p>
We sat grown quiet at the name of love;<br/>
We saw the last embers of daylight die,<br/>
And in the trembling blue-green of the sky<br/>
A moon, worn as if it had been a shell<br/>
Washed by time's waters as they rose and fell<br/>
About the stars and broke in days and years.
</p>
<p>
I had a thought for no one's but your ears;<br/>
That you were beautiful, and that I strove
To love you in the old high way of love;<br/>
That it had all seemed happy, and yet we'd grown<br/>
As weary hearted as that hollow moon.

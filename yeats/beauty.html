<h1>He Remembers Forgotten Beauty</h1>
<h2>by W.B. Yeats (1899)</h2>
<p>
When my arms wrap you round I press<br/>
My heart upon the loveliness<br/>
That has long faded from the world;<br/>
The jewelled crowns that kings have hurled<br/>
In shadowy pools, when armies fled;<br/>
The love-tales wrought with silken thread<br/>
By dreaming ladies upon cloth<br/>
That has made fat the murderous moth;<br/>
The roses that of old time were<br/>
Woven by ladies in their hair,<br/>
The dew-cold lilies ladies bore<br/>
Through many a sacred corridor<br/>
Where such gray clouds of incense rose<br/>
That only the gods' eyes did not close:<br/>
For that pale breast and lingering hand<br/>
Come from a more dream-heavy land,<br/>
A more dream-heavy hour than this;<br/>
And when you sigh from kiss to kiss<br/>
I hear white Beauty sighing, too,<br/>
For hours when all must fade like dew,<br/>
All but the flames, and deep on deep,<br/>
Throne over throne where in half sleep,<br/>
Their swords upon their iron knees,<br/>
Brood her high lonely mysteries.

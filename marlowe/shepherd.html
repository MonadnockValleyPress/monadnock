<h1>The Passionate Shepherd to His Love</h1>
<h2>by Christopher Marlowe</h2>
<p>
Come live with me, and be my love;<br/>
And we will all the pleasures prove<br/>
That hills and valleys, dales and fields,<br/>
Woods, or steepy mountain yields.
</p>
<p>
And we will sit upon the rocks,<br/>
Seeing the shepherds feed their flocks<br/>
By shallow rivers to whose falls<br/>
Melodious birds sing madrigals.
</p>
<p>
And I will make thee beds of roses,<br/>
And a thousand fragrant posies;<br/>
A cap of flowers, and a kirtle<br/>
Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle;
</p>
<p>
A gown made of the finest wool<br/>
Which from our pretty lambs we pull;<br/>
Fair lin√®d slippers for the cold,<br/>
With buckles of the purest gold;
</p>
<p>
A belt of straw and ivy-buds,<br/>
With coral clasps and amber studs:<br/>
And, if these pleasures may thee move,<br/>
Come live with me, and be my love.
</p>
<p>
The shepherds' swains shall dance and sing<br/>
For thy delight each May-morning:<br/>
If these delights thy mind may move,<br/>
Then live with me, and be my love.
</p>

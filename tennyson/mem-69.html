<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>LXIX</h3>
<p>
I dream'd there would be Spring no more,<br/>
That Nature's ancient power was lost:<br/>
The streets were black with smoke and frost,<br/>
They chatter'd trifles at the door:
</p>
<p>
I wander'd from the noisy town,<br/>
I found a wood with thorny boughs:<br/>
I took the thorns to bind my brows,<br/>
I wore them like a civic crown:
</p>
<p>
I met with scoffs, I met with scorns<br/>
From youth and babe and hoary hairs:<br/>
They call'd me in the public squares<br/>
The fool that wears a crown of thorns:
</p>
<p>
They call'd me fool, they call'd me child:<br/>
I found an angel of the night;<br/>
The voice was low, the look was bright;<br/>
He look'd upon my crown and smiled:
</p>
<p>
He reach'd the glory of a hand,<br/>
That seem'd to touch it into leaf:<br/>
The voice was not the voice of grief,<br/>
The words were hard to understand.

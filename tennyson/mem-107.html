<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>CVII</h3>
<p>
It is the day when he was born,<br/>
A bitter day that early sank<br/>
Behind a purple-frosty bank<br/>
Of vapour, leaving night forlorn.
</p>
<p>
The time admits not flowers or leaves<br/>
To deck the banquet. Fiercely flies<br/>
The blast of North and East, and ice<br/>
Makes daggers at the sharpen'd eaves,
</p>
<p>
And bristles all the brakes and thorns<br/>
To yon hard crescent, as she hangs<br/>
Above the wood which grides and clangs<br/>
Its leafless ribs and iron horns
</p>
<p>
Together, in the drifts that pass<br/>
To darken on the rolling brine<br/>
That breaks the coast. But fetch the wine,<br/>
Arrange the board and brim the glass;
</p>
<p>
Bring in great logs and let them lie,<br/>
To make a solid core of heat;<br/>
Be cheerful-minded, talk and treat<br/>
Of all things ev'n as he were by;
</p>
<p>
We keep the day. With festal cheer,<br/>
With books and music, surely we<br/>
Will drink to him, whate'er he be,<br/>
And sing the songs he loved to hear.
</p>

<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>CIII</h3>
<p>
On that last night before we went<br/>
From out the doors where I was bred,<br/>
I dream'd a vision of the dead,<br/>
Which left my after-morn content.
</p>
<p>
Methought I dwelt within a hall,<br/>
And maidens with me: distant hills<br/>
From hidden summits fed with rills<br/>
A river sliding by the wall.
</p>
<p>
The hall with harp and carol rang.<br/>
They sang of what is wise and good<br/>
And graceful. In the centre stood<br/>
A statue veil'd, to which they sang;
</p>
<p>
And which, tho' veil'd, was known to me,<br/>
The shape of him I loved, and love<br/>
For ever: then flew in a dove<br/>
And brought a summons from the sea:
</p>
<p>
And when they learnt that I must go<br/>
They wept and wail'd, but led the way<br/>
To where a little shallop lay<br/>
At anchor in the flood below;
</p>
<p>
And on by many a level mead,<br/>
And shadowing bluff that made the banks,<br/>
We glided winding under ranks<br/>
Of iris, and the golden reed;
</p>
<p>
And still as vaster grew the shore<br/>
And roll'd the floods in grander space,<br/>
The maidens gather'd strength and grace<br/>
And presence, lordlier than before;
</p>
<p>
And I myself, who sat apart<br/>
And watch'd them, wax'd in every limb;<br/>
I felt the thews of Anakim,<br/>
The pulses of a Titan's heart;
</p>
<p>
As one would sing the death of war,<br/>
And one would chant the history<br/>
Of that great race, which is to be,<br/>
And one the shaping of a star;
</p>
<p>
Until the forward-creeping tides<br/>
Began to foam, and we to draw<br/>
From deep to deep, to where we saw<br/>
A great ship lift her shining sides.
</p>
<p>
The man we loved was there on deck,<br/>
But thrice as large as man he bent<br/>
To greet us. Up the side I went,<br/>
And fell in silence on his neck;
</p>
<p>
Whereat those maidens with one mind<br/>
Bewail'd their lot; I did them wrong:<br/>
'We served thee here,' they said, 'so long,<br/>
And wilt thou leave us now behind?'
</p>
<p>
So rapt I was, they could not win<br/>
An answer from my lips, but he<br/>
Replying, 'Enter likewise ye<br/>
And go with us:' they enter'd in.
</p>
<p>
And while the wind began to sweep<br/>
A music out of sheet and shroud,<br/>
We steer'd her toward a crimson cloud<br/>
That landlike slept along the deep.

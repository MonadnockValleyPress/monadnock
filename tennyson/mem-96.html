<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>XCVI</h3>
<p>
You say, but with no touch of scorn,<br/>
Sweet-hearted, you, whose light-blue eyes<br/>
Are tender over drowning flies,<br/>
You tell me, doubt is Devil-born.
</p>
<p>
I know not: one indeed I knew<br/>
In many a subtle question versed,<br/>
Who touch'd a jarring lyre at first,<br/>
But ever strove to make it true:
</p>
<p>
Perplext in faith, but pure in deeds,<br/>
At last he beat his music out.<br/>
There lives more faith in honest doubt,<br/>
Believe me, than in half the creeds.
</p>
<p>
He fought his doubts and gather'd strength,<br/>
He would not make his judgment blind,<br/>
He faced the spectres of the mind<br/>
And laid them: thus he came at length
</p>
<p>
To find a stronger faith his own;<br/>
And Power was with him in the night,<br/>
Which makes the darkness and the light,<br/>
And dwells not in the light alone,
</p>
<p>
But in the darkness and the cloud,<br/>
As over Sinai's peaks of old,<br/>
While Israel made their gods of gold,<br/>
Altho' the trumpet blew so loud.

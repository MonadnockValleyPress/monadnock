<h1>The Charge of the Light Brigade</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson (1854)</h2>
<p>
Half a league, half a league,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Half a league onward,<br/>
All in the valley of Death<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode the six hundred.<br/>
'Forward, the Light Brigade!<br/>
Charge for the guns' he said:<br/>
Into the valley of Death<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode the six hundred.
</p>
<p>
'Forward, the Light Brigade!'<br/>
Was there a man dismay'd?<br/>
Not tho' the soldiers knew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some one had blunder'd:<br/>
Their's not to make reply,<br/>
Their's not to reason why,<br/>
Their's but to do and die:<br/>
Into the valley of Death<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode the six hundred.
</p>
<p>
Cannon to right of them,<br/>
Cannon to left of them,<br/>
Cannon in front of them<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Volley'd and thunder'd;<br/>
Storm'd at with shot and shell,<br/>
Boldly they rode and well,<br/>
Into the jaws of Death,<br/>
Into the mouth of Hell<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode the six hundred.
</p>
<p>
Flash'd all their sabres bare,<br/>
Flash'd as they turned in air<br/>
Sabring the gunners there,<br/>
Charging an army while<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All the world wonder'd:<br/>
Plunged in the battery-smoke<br/>
Right thro' the line they broke;<br/>
Cossack and Russian<br/>
Reel'd from the sabre-stroke<br/>
Shatter'd and sunder'd.<br/>
Then they rode back, but not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the six hundred.
</p>
<p>
Cannon to right of them,<br/>
Cannon to left of them,<br/>
Cannon behind them<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Volley'd and thunder'd;<br/>
Storm'd at with shot and shell,<br/>
While horse and hero fell,<br/>
They that had fought so well<br/>
Came thro' the jaws of Death,<br/>
Back from the mouth of Hell,<br/>
All that was left of them,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Left of six hundred.
</p>
<p>
When can their glory fade?<br/>
O the wild charge they made!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All the world wonder'd.<br/>
Honour the charge they made!<br/>
Honour the Light Brigade,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Noble six hundred!

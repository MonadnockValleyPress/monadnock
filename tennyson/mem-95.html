<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>XCV</h3>
<p>
By night we linger'd on the lawn,<br/>
For underfoot the herb was dry;<br/>
And genial warmth; and o'er the sky<br/>
The silvery haze of summer drawn;
</p>
<p>
And calm that let the tapers burn<br/>
Unwavering: not a cricket chirr'd:<br/>
The brook alone far-off was heard,<br/>
And on the board the fluttering urn:
</p>
<p>
And bats went round in fragrant skies,<br/>
And wheel'd or lit the filmy shapes<br/>
That haunt the dusk, with ermine capes<br/>
And woolly breasts and beaded eyes;
</p>
<p>
While now we sang old songs that peal'd<br/>
From knoll to knoll, where, couch'd at ease,<br/>
The white kine glimmer'd, and the trees<br/>
Laid their dark arms about the field.
</p>
<p>
But when those others, one by one,<br/>
Withdrew themselves from me and night,<br/>
And in the house light after light<br/>
Went out, and I was all alone,
</p>
<p>
A hunger seized my heart; I read<br/>
Of that glad year which once had been,<br/>
In those fall'n leaves which kept their green,<br/>
The noble letters of the dead:
</p>
<p>
And strangely on the silence broke<br/>
The silent-speaking words, and strange<br/>
Was love's dumb cry defying change<br/>
To test his worth; and strangely spoke
</p>
<p>
The faith, the vigour, bold to dwell<br/>
On doubts that drive the coward back,<br/>
And keen thro' wordy snares to track<br/>
Suggestion to her inmost cell.
</p>
<p>
So word by word, and line by line,<br/>
The dead man touch'd me from the past,<br/>
And all at once it seem'd at last<br/>
The living soul was flash'd on mine,
</p>
<p>
And mine in his was wound, and whirl'd<br/>
About empyreal heights of thought,<br/>
And came on that which is, and caught<br/>
The deep pulsations of the world,
</p>
<p>
Ä†onian music measuring out<br/>
The steps of Time&mdash;the shocks of Chance&mdash;<br/>
The blows of Death. At length my trance<br/>
Was cancell'd, stricken thro' with doubt.
</p>
<p>
Vague words! but ah, how hard to frame<br/>
In matter-moulded forms of speech,<br/>
Or ev'n for intellect to reach<br/>
Thro' memory that which I became:
</p>
<p>
Till now the doubtful dusk reveal'd<br/>
The knolls once more where, couch'd at ease,<br/>
The white kine glimmer'd, and the trees<br/>
Laid their dark arms about the field;
</p>
<p>
And suck'd from out the distant gloom<br/>
A breeze began to tremble o'er<br/>
The large leaves of the sycamore,<br/>
And fluctuate all the still perfume,
</p>
<p>
And gathering freshlier overhead,<br/>
Rock'd the full-foliaged elms, and swung<br/>
The heavy-folded rose, and flung<br/>
The lilies to and fro, and said,
</p>
<p>
'The dawn, the dawn,' and died away;<br/>
And East and West, without a breath,<br/>
Mixt their dim lights, like life and death,<br/>
To broaden into boundless day.

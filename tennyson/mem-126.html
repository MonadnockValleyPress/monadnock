<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>CXXVI</h3>
<p>
Love is and was my Lord and King,<br/>
And in his presence I attend<br/>
To hear the tidings of my friend,<br/>
Which every hour his couriers bring.
</p>
<p>
Love is and was my King and Lord,<br/>
And will be, tho' as yet I keep<br/>
Within his court on earth, and sleep<br/>
Encompass'd by his faithful guard,
</p>
<p>
And hear at times a sentinel<br/>
Who moves about from place to place,<br/>
And whispers to the worlds of space,<br/>
In the deep night, that all is well.

<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>LIII</h3>
<p>
How many a father have I seen,<br/>
A sober man, among his boys,<br/>
Whose youth was full of foolish noise,<br/>
Who wears his manhood hale and green:
</p>
<p>
And dare we to this fancy give,<br/>
That had the wild oat not been sown,<br/>
The soil, left barren, scarce had grown<br/>
The grain by which a man may live?
</p>
<p>
Or, if we held the doctrine sound<br/>
For life outliving heats of youth,<br/>
Yet who would preach it as a truth<br/>
To those that eddy round and round?
</p>
<p>
Hold thou the good: define it well:<br/>
For fear divine Philosophy<br/>
Should push beyond her mark, and be<br/>
Procuress to the Lords of Hell.

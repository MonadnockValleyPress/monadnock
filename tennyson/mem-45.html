<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>XLV</h3>
<p>
The baby new to earth and sky,<br/>
What time his tender palm is prest<br/>
Against the circle of the breast,<br/>
Has never thought that 'this is I:'
</p>
<p>
But as he grows he gathers much,<br/>
And learns the use of 'I' and 'me,'<br/>
And finds 'I am not what I see,<br/>
And other than the things I touch.'
</p>
<p>
So rounds he to a separate mind<br/>
From whence clear memory may begin,<br/>
As thro' the frame that binds him in<br/>
His isolation grows defined.
</p>
<p>
This use may lie in blood and breath,<br/>
Which else were fruitless of their due,<br/>
Had man to learn himself anew<br/>
Beyond the second birth of Death.

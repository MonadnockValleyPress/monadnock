<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>LX</h3>
<p>
He past; a soul of nobler tone:<br/>
My spirit loved and loves him yet,<br/>
Like some poor girl whose heart is set<br/>
On one whose rank exceeds her own.
</p>
<p>
He mixing with his proper sphere,<br/>
She finds the baseness of her lot,<br/>
Half jealous of she knows not what,<br/>
And envying all that meet him there.
</p>
<p>
The little village looks forlorn;<br/>
She sighs amid her narrow days,<br/>
Moving about the household ways,<br/>
In that dark house where she was born.
</p>
<p>
The foolish neighbors come and go,<br/>
And tease her till the day draws by:<br/>
At night she weeps, 'How vain am I!'<br/>
How should he love a thing so low?'

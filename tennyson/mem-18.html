<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>XVIII</h3>
<p>
'Tis well; 'tis something; we may stand<br/>
Where he in English earth is laid,<br/>
And from his ashes may be made<br/>
The violet of his native land.
</p>
<p>
'Tis little; but it looks in truth<br/>
As if the quiet bones were blest<br/>
Among familiar names to rest<br/>
And in the places of his youth.
</p>
<p>
Come then, pure hands, and bear the head<br/>
That sleeps or wears the mask of sleep,<br/>
And come, whatever loves to weep,<br/>
And hear the ritual of the dead.
</p>
<p>
Ah yet, ev'n yet, if this might be,<br/>
I, falling on his faithful heart,<br/>
Would breathing thro' his lips impart<br/>
The life that almost dies in me;
</p>
<p>
That dies not, but endures with pain,<br/>
And slowly forms the firmer mind,<br/>
Treasuring the look it cannot find,<br/>
The words that are not heard again.

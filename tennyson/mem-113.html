<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>CXIII</h3>
<p>
'Tis held that sorrow makes us wise;<br/>
Yet how much wisdom sleeps with thee<br/>
Which not alone had guided me,<br/>
But served the seasons that may rise;
</p>
<p>
For can I doubt, who knew thee keen<br/>
In intellect, with force and skill<br/>
To strive, to fashion, to fulfil&mdash;<br/>
I doubt not what thou wouldst have been:
</p>
<p>
A life in civic action warm,<br/>
A soul on highest mission sent,<br/>
A potent voice of Parliament,<br/>
A pillar steadfast in the storm,
</p>
<p>
Should licensed boldness gather force,<br/>
Becoming, when the time has birth,<br/>
A lever to uplift the earth<br/>
And roll it in another course,
</p>
<p>
With thousand shocks that come and go,<br/>
With agonies, with energies,<br/>
With overthrowings, and with cries<br/>
And undulations to and fro.

<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>XXIV</h3>
<p>
And was the day of my delight<br/>
As pure and perfect as I say?<br/>
The very source and fount of Day<br/>
Is dash'd with wandering isles of night.
</p>
<p>
If all was good and fair we met,<br/>
This earth had been the Paradise<br/>
It never look'd to human eyes<br/>
Since our first Sun arose and set.
</p>
<p>
And is it that the haze of grief<br/>
Makes former gladness loom so great?<br/>
The lowness of the present state,<br/>
That sets the past in this relief?
</p>
<p>
Or that the past will always win<br/>
A glory from its being far;<br/>
And orb into the perfect star<br/>
We saw not, when we moved therein?

<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>VIII</h3>
<p>
A happy lover who has come<br/>
To look on her that loves him well,<br/>
Who 'lights and rings the gateway bell,<br/>
And learns her gone and far from home;
</p>
<p>
He saddens, all the magic light<br/>
Dies off at once from bower and hall,<br/>
And all the place is dark, and all<br/>
The chambers emptied of delight:
</p>
<p>
So find I every pleasant spot<br/>
In which we two were wont to meet,<br/>
The field, the chamber, and the street,<br/>
For all is dark where thou art not.
</p>
<p>
Yet as that other, wandering there<br/>
In those deserted walks, may find<br/>
A flower beat with rain and wind,<br/>
Which once she foster'd up with care;
</p>
<p>
So seems it in my deep regret,<br/>
O my forsaken heart, with thee<br/>
And this poor flower of poesy<br/>
Which little cared for fades not yet.
</p>
<p>
But since it pleased a vanish'd eye,<br/>
I go to plant it on his tomb,<br/>
That if it can it there may bloom,<br/>
Or, dying, there at least may die.

<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>XCVIII</h3>
<p>
You leave us: you will see the Rhine,<br/>
And those fair hills I sail'd below,<br/>
When I was there with him; and go<br/>
By summer belts of wheat and vine
</p>
<p>
To where he breathed his latest breath,<br/>
That City. All her splendour seems<br/>
No livelier than the wisp that gleams<br/>
On Lethe in the eyes of Death.
</p>
<p>
Let her great Danube rolling fair<br/>
Enwind her isles, unmark'd of me:<br/>
I have not seen, I will not see<br/>
Vienna; rather dream that there,
</p>
<p>
A treble darkness, Evil haunts<br/>
The birth, the bridal; friend from friend<br/>
Is oftener parted, fathers bend<br/>
Above more graves, a thousand wants
</p>
<p>
Gnarr at the heels of men, and prey<br/>
By each cold hearth, and sadness flings<br/>
Her shadow on the blaze of kings:<br/>
And yet myself have heard him say,
</p>
<p>
That not in any mother town<br/>
With statelier progress to and fro<br/>
The double tides of chariots flow<br/>
By park and suburb under brown
</p>
<p>
Of lustier leaves; nor more content,<br/>
He told me, lives in any crowd,<br/>
When all is gay with lamps, and loud<br/>
With sport and song, in booth and tent,
</p>
<p>
Imperial halls, or open plain;<br/>
And wheels the circled dance, and breaks<br/>
The rocket molten into flakes<br/>
Of crimson or in emerald rain.

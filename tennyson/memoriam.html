<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson (1833)</h2>

<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>Strong Son of God, immortal Love,<br />
Whom we, that have not seen thy face,<br />
By faith, and faith alone, embrace,<br />
Believing where we cannot prove;</p>
<p>Thine are these orbs of light and shade;<br />
Thou madest Life in man and brute;<br />
Thou madest Death; and lo, thy foot<br />
Is on the skull which thou hast made.</p>
<p>Thou wilt not leave us in the dust:<br />
Thou madest man, he knows not why,<br />
He thinks he was not made to die;<br />
And thou hast made him: thou art just.</p>
<p>Thou seemest human and divine,<br />
The highest, holiest manhood, thou.<br />
Our wills are ours, we know not how;<br />
Our wills are ours, to make them thine.</p>
<p>Our little systems have their day;<br />
They have their day and cease to be:<br />
They are but broken lights of thee,<br />
And thou, O Lord, art more than they.</p>
<p>We have but faith: we cannot know;<br />
For knowledge is of things we see<br />
And yet we trust it comes from thee,<br />
A beam in darkness: let it grow.</p>
<p>Let knowledge grow from more to more,<br />
But more of reverence in us dwell;<br />
That mind and soul, according well,<br />
May make one music as before,</p>
<p>But vaster. We are fools and slight;<br />
We mock thee when we do not fear:<br />
But help thy foolish ones to bear;<br />
Help thy vain worlds to bear thy light.</p>
<p>Forgive what seem'd my sin in me;<br />
What seem'd my worth since I began;<br />
For merit lives from man to man,<br />
And not from man, O Lord, to thee.</p>
<p>Forgive my grief for one removed,<br />
Thy creature, whom I found so fair.<br />
I trust he lives in thee, and there<br />
I find him worthier to be loved.</p>
<p>Forgive these wild and wandering cries,<br />
Confusions of a wasted youth;<br />
Forgive them where they fail in truth,<br />
And in thy wisdom make me wise.</p>
<p><i>1849</i>.<br /></p>
<h2>I</h2>
<p>I held it truth, with him who sings<br />
To one clear harp in divers tones,<br />
That men may rise on stepping-stones<br />
Of their dead selves to higher things.</p>
<p>But who shall so forecast the years<br />
And find in loss a gain to match?<br />
Or reach a hand thro' time to catch<br />
The far-off interest of tears?</p>
<p>Let Love clasp Grief lest both be drown'd,<br />
Let darkness keep her raven gloss:<br />
Ah, sweeter to be drunk with loss,<br />
To dance with death, to beat the ground,</p>
<p>Than that the victor Hours should scorn<br />
The long result of love, and boast,<br />
'Behold the man that loved and lost,<br />
But all he was is overworn.'<br /></p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p>Old Yew, which graspest at the stones<br />
That name the under-lying dead,<br />
Thy fibres net the dreamless head,<br />
Thy roots are wrapt about the bones.</p>
<p>The seasons bring the flower again,<br />
And bring the firstling to the flock;<br />
And in the dusk of thee, the clock<br />
Beats out the little lives of men.</p>
<p>O, not for thee the glow, the bloom,<br />
Who changest not in any gale,<br />
Nor branding summer suns avail<br />
To touch thy thousand years of gloom:</p>
<p>And gazing on thee, sullen tree,<br />
Sick for thy stubborn hardihood,<br />
I seem to fail from out my blood<br />
And grow incorporate into thee.<br /></p>
<h2>III</h2>
<p>O Sorrow, cruel fellowship,<br />
O Priestess in the vaults of Death,<br />
O sweet and bitter in a breath,<br />
What whispers from thy lying lip?</p>
<p>'The stars,' she whispers, ‘blindly run;<br />
A web is wov'n across the sky;<br />
From out waste places comes a cry,<br />
And murmurs from the dying sun:</p>
<p>'And all the phantom, Nature, stands?<br />
With all the music in her tone,<br />
A hollow echo of my own,?<br />
A hollow form with empty hands.'</p>
<p>And shall I take a thing so blind,<br />
Embrace her as my natural good;<br />
Or crush her, like a vice of blood,<br />
Upon the threshold of the mind?<br /></p>
<h2>IV</h2>
<p>To Sleep I give my powers away;<br />
My will is bondsman to the dark;<br />
I sit within a helmless bark,<br />
And with my heart I muse and say:</p>
<p>O heart, how fares it with thee now,<br />
That thou should'st fail from thy desire,<br />
Who scarcely darest to inquire,<br />
'What is it makes me beat so low?'</p>
<p>Something it is which thou hast lost,<br />
Some pleasure from thine early years.<br />
Break, thou deep vase of chilling tears,<br />
That grief hath shaken into frost!</p>
<p>Such clouds of nameless trouble cross<br />
All night below the darken'd eyes;<br />
With morning wakes the will, and cries,<br />
'Thou shalt not be the fool of loss.'<br /></p>
<h2>V</h2>
<p>I sometimes hold it half a sin<br />
To put in words the grief I feel;<br />
For words, like Nature, half reveal<br />
And half conceal the Soul within.</p>
<p>But, for the unquiet heart and brain,<br />
A use in measured language lies;<br />
The sad mechanic exercise,<br />
Like dull narcotics, numbing pain.</p>
<p>In words, like weeds, I'll wrap me o'er,<br />
Like coarsest clothes against the cold:<br />
But that large grief which these enfold<br />
Is given in outline and no more.<br /></p>
<h2>VI</h2>
<p>One writes, that 'Other friends remain,'<br />
That ‘Loss is common to the race'?<br />
And common is the commonplace,<br />
And vacant chaff well meant for grain.</p>
<p>That loss is common would not make<br />
My own less bitter, rather more:<br />
Too common! Never morning wore<br />
To evening, but some heart did break.</p>
<p>O father, wheresoe'er thou be,<br />
Who pledgest now thy gallant son;<br />
A shot, ere half thy draught be done,<br />
Hath still'd the life that beat from thee.</p>
<p>O mother, praying God will save<br />
Thy sailor,—while thy head is bow'd,<br />
His heavy-shotted hammock-shroud<br />
Drops in his vast and wandering grave.</p>
<p>Ye know no more than I who wrought<br />
At that last hour to please him well;<br />
Who mused on all I had to tell,<br />
And something written, something thought;</p>
<p>Expecting still his advent home;<br />
And ever met him on his way<br />
With wishes, thinking, 'here to-day,'<br />
Or 'here to-morrow will he come.'</p>
<p>O somewhere, meek, unconscious dove,<br />
That sittest ranging golden hair;<br />
And glad to find thyself so fair,<br />
Poor child, that waitest for thy love!</p>
<p>For now her father's chimney glows<br />
In expectation of a guest;<br />
And thinking ‘this will please him best,'<br />
She takes a riband or a rose;</p>
<p>For he will see them on to-night;<br />
And with the thought her colour burns;<br />
And, having left the glass, she turns<br />
Once more to set a ringlet right;</p>
<p>And, even when she turn'd, the curse<br />
Had fallen, and her future Lord<br />
Was drown'd in passing thro' the ford,<br />
Or kill'd in falling from his horse.</p>
<p>O what to her shall be the end?<br />
And what to me remains of good?<br />
To her, perpetual maidenhood,<br />
And unto me no second friend.<br /></p>
<h2>VII</h2>
<p>Dark house, by which once more I stand<br />
Here in the long unlovely street,<br />
Doors, where my heart was used to beat<br />
So quickly, waiting for a hand,</p>
<p>A hand that can be clasp'd no more?<br />
Behold me, for I cannot sleep,<br />
And like a guilty thing I creep<br />
At earliest morning to the door.</p>
<p>He is not here; but far away<br />
The noise of life begins again,<br />
And ghastly thro' the drizzling rain<br />
On the bald street breaks the blank day.<br /></p>
<h2>VIII</h2>
<p>A happy lover who has come<br />
To look on her that loves him well,<br />
Who 'lights and rings the gateway bell,<br />
And learns her gone and far from home;</p>
<p>He saddens, all the magic light<br />
Dies off at once from bower and hall,<br />
And all the place is dark, and all<br />
The chambers emptied of delight:</p>
<p>So find I every pleasant spot<br />
In which we two were wont to meet,<br />
The field, the chamber, and the street,<br />
For all is dark where thou art not.</p>
<p>Yet as that other, wandering there<br />
In those deserted walks, may find<br />
A flower beat with rain and wind,<br />
Which once she foster'd up with care;</p>
<p>So seems it in my deep regret,<br />
O my forsaken heart, with thee<br />
And this poor flower of poesy<br />
Which little cared for fades not yet.</p>
<p>But since it pleased a vanish'd eye,<br />
I go to plant it on his tomb,<br />
That if it can it there may bloom,<br />
Or, dying, there at least may die.<br /></p>
<h2>IX</h2>
<p>Fair ship, that from the Italian shore<br />
Sailest the placid ocean-plains<br />
With my lost Arthur's loved remains,<br />
Spread thy full wings, and waft him o'er.</p>
<p>So draw him home to those that mourn<br />
In vain; a favourable speed<br />
Ruffle thy mirror'd mast, and lead<br />
Thro' prosperous floods his holy urn.</p>
<p>All night no ruder air perplex<br />
Thy sliding keel, till Phosphor, bright<br />
As our pure love, thro' early light<br />
Shall glimmer on the dewy decks.</p>
<p>Sphere all your lights around, above;<br />
Sleep, gentle heavens, before the prow;<br />
Sleep, gentle winds, as he sleeps now,<br />
My friend, the brother of my love;</p>
<p>My Arthur, whom I shall not see<br />
Till all my widow'd race be run;<br />
Dear as the mother to the son,<br />
More than my brothers are to me.<br /></p>
<h2>X</h2>
<p>I hear the noise about thy keel;<br />
I hear the bell struck in the night:<br />
I see the cabin-window bright;<br />
I see the sailor at the wheel.</p>
<p>Thou bring'st the sailor to his wife,<br />
And travell'd men from foreign lands;<br />
And letters unto trembling hands;<br />
And, thy dark freight, a vanish'd life.</p>
<p>So bring him; we have idle dreams:<br />
This look of quiet flatters thus<br />
Our home-bred fancies. O to us,<br />
The fools of habit, sweeter seems</p>
<p>To rest beneath the clover sod,<br />
That takes the sunshine and the rains,<br />
Or where the kneeling hamlet drains<br />
The chalice of the grapes of God;</p>
<p>Than if with thee the roaring wells<br />
Should gulf him fathom-deep in brine;<br />
And hands so often clasp'd in mine,<br />
Should toss with tangle and with shells.<br /></p>
<h2>XI</h2>
<p>Calm is the morn without a sound,<br />
Calm as to suit a calmer grief,<br />
And only thro' the faded leaf<br />
The chestnut pattering to the ground:</p>
<p>Calm and deep peace on this high world,<br />
And on these dews that drench the furze,<br />
And all the silvery gossamers<br />
That twinkle into green and gold:</p>
<p>Calm and still light on yon great plain<br />
That sweeps with all its autumn bowers,<br />
And crowded farms and lessening towers,<br />
To mingle with the bounding main:</p>
<p>Calm and deep peace in this wide air,<br />
These leaves that redden to the fall;<br />
And in my heart, if calm at all,<br />
If any calm, a calm despair:</p>
<p>Calm on the seas, and silver sleep,<br />
And waves that sway themselves in rest,<br />
And dead calm in that noble breast<br />
Which heaves but with the heaving deep.<br /></p>
<h2>XII</h2>
<p>Lo, as a dove when up she springs<br />
To bear thro' Heaven a tale of woe,<br />
Some dolorous message knit below<br />
The wild pulsation of her wings;</p>
<p>Like her I go; I cannot stay;<br />
I leave this mortal ark behind,<br />
A weight of nerves without a mind,<br />
And leave the cliffs, and haste away</p>
<p>O'er ocean-mirrors rounded large,<br />
And reach the glow of southern skies,<br />
And see the sails at distance rise,<br />
And linger weeping on the marge,</p>
<p>And saying; ‘Comes he thus, my friend?<br />
Is this the end of all my care?'<br />
And circle moaning in the air:<br />
'Is this the end? Is this the end?'</p>
<p>And forward dart again, and play<br />
About the prow, and back return<br />
To where the body sits, and learn<br />
That I have been an hour away.<br /></p>
<h2>XIII</h2>
<p>Tears of the widower, when he sees<br />
A late-lost form that sleep reveals,<br />
And moves his doubtful arms, and feels<br />
Her place is empty, fall like these;</p>
<p>Which weep a loss for ever new,<br />
A void where heart on heart reposed;<br />
And, where warm hands have prest and closed,<br />
Silence, till I be silent too.</p>
<p>Which weep the comrade of my choice,<br />
An awful thought, a life removed,<br />
The human-hearted man I loved,<br />
A Spirit, not a breathing voice.</p>
<p>Come, Time, and teach me, many years,<br />
I do not suffer in a dream;<br />
For now so strange do these things seem,<br />
Mine eyes have leisure for their tears;</p>
<p>My fancies time to rise on wing,<br />
And glance about the approaching sails,<br />
As tho' they brought but merchants' bales,<br />
And not the burthen that they bring.<br /></p>
<h2>XIV</h2>
<p>If one should bring me this report,<br />
That thou hadst touch'd the land to-day,<br />
And I went down unto the quay,<br />
And found thee lying in the port;</p>
<p>And standing, muffled round with woe,<br />
Should see thy passengers in rank<br />
Come stepping lightly down the plank,<br />
And beckoning unto those they know;</p>
<p>And if along with these should come<br />
The man I held as half-divine;<br />
Should strike a sudden hand in mine,<br />
And ask a thousand things of home;</p>
<p>And I should tell him all my pain,<br />
And how my life had droop'd of late,<br />
And he should sorrow o'er my state<br />
And marvel what possess'd my brain;</p>
<p>And I perceived no touch of change,<br />
No hint of death in all his frame,<br />
But found him all in all the same,<br />
I should not feel it to be strange.<br /></p>
<h2>XV</h2>
<p>To-night the winds begin to rise<br />
And roar from yonder dropping day:<br />
The last red leaf is whirl'd away,<br />
The rooks are blown about the skies;</p>
<p>The forest crack'd, the waters curl'd,<br />
The cattle huddled on the lea;<br />
And wildly dash'd on tower and tree<br />
The sunbeam strikes along the world:</p>
<p>And but for fancies, which aver<br />
That all thy motions gently pass<br />
Athwart a plane of molten glass,<br />
I scarce could brook the strain and stir</p>
<p>That makes the barren branches loud;<br />
And but for fear it is not so,<br />
The wild unrest that lives in woe<br />
Would dote and pore on yonder cloud</p>
<p>That rises upward always higher,<br />
And onward drags a labouring breast,<br />
And topples round the dreary west,<br />
A looming bastion fringed with fire.<br /></p>
<h2>XVI</h2>
<p>What words are these have falle'n from me?<br />
Can calm despair and wild unrest<br />
Be tenants of a single breast,<br />
Or sorrow such a changeling be?</p>
<p>Or cloth she only seem to take<br />
The touch of change in calm or storm;<br />
But knows no more of transient form<br />
In her deep self, than some dead lake</p>
<p>That holds the shadow of a lark<br />
Hung in the shadow of a heaven?<br />
Or has the shock, so harshly given,<br />
Confused me like the unhappy bark</p>
<p>That strikes by night a craggy shelf,<br />
And staggers blindly ere she sink?<br />
And stunn'd me from my power to think<br />
And all my knowledge of myself;</p>
<p>And made me that delirious man<br />
Whose fancy fuses old and new,<br />
And flashes into false and true,<br />
And mingles all without a plan?<br /></p>
<h2>XVII</h2>
<p>Thou comest, much wept for: such a breeze<br />
Compell'd thy canvas, and my prayer<br />
Was as the whisper of an air<br />
To breathe thee over lonely seas.</p>
<p>For I in spirit saw thee move<br />
Thro' circles of the bounding sky,<br />
Week after week: the days go by:<br />
Come quick, thou bringest all I love.</p>
<p>Henceforth, wherever thou may'st roam,<br />
My blessing, like a line of light,<br />
Is on the waters day and night,<br />
And like a beacon guards thee home.</p>
<p>So may whatever tempest mars<br />
Mid-ocean, spare thee, sacred bark;<br />
And balmy drops in summer dark<br />
Slide from the bosom of the stars.</p>
<p>So kind an office hath been done,<br />
Such precious relics brought by thee;<br />
The dust of him I shall not see<br />
Till all my widow'd race be run.<br /></p>
<h2>XVIII</h2>
<p>'Tis well; 'tis something; we may stand<br />
Where he in English earth is laid,<br />
And from his ashes may be made<br />
The violet of his native land.</p>
<p>'Tis little; but it looks in truth<br />
As if the quiet bones were blest<br />
Among familiar names to rest<br />
And in the places of his youth.</p>
<p>Come then, pure hands, and bear the head<br />
That sleeps or wears the mask of sleep,<br />
And come, whatever loves to weep,<br />
And hear the ritual of the dead.</p>
<p>Ah yet, ev'n yet, if this might be,<br />
I, falling on his faithful heart,<br />
Would breathing thro' his lips impart<br />
The life that almost dies in me;</p>
<p>That dies not, but endures with pain,<br />
And slowly forms the firmer mind,<br />
Treasuring the look it cannot find,<br />
The words that are not heard again.<br /></p>
<h2>XIX</h2>
<p>The Danube to the Severn gave<br />
The darken'd heart that beat no more;<br />
They laid him by the pleasant shore,<br />
And in the hearing of the wave.</p>
<p>There twice a day the Severn fills;<br />
The salt sea-water passes by,<br />
And hushes half the babbling Wye,<br />
And makes a silence in the hills.</p>
<p>The Wye is hush'd nor moved along,<br />
And hush'd my deepest grief of all,<br />
When fill'd with tears that cannot fall,<br />
I brim with sorrow drowning song.</p>
<p>The tide flows down, the wave again<br />
Is vocal in its wooded walls;<br />
My deeper anguish also falls,<br />
And I can speak a little then.<br /></p>
<h2>XX</h2>
<p>The lesser griefs that may be said,<br />
That breathe a thousand tender vows,<br />
Are but as servants in a house<br />
Where lies the master newly dead;</p>
<p>Who speak their feeling as it is,<br />
And weep the fulness from the mind:<br />
‘It will be hard,' they say, ‘to find<br />
Another service such as this.'</p>
<p>My lighter moods are like to these,<br />
That out of words a comfort win;<br />
But there are other griefs within,<br />
And tears that at their fountain freeze;</p>
<p>For by the hearth the children sit<br />
Cold in that atmosphere of Death,<br />
And scarce endure to draw the breath,<br />
Or like to noiseless phantoms flit;</p>
<p>But open converse is there none,<br />
So much the vital spirits sink<br />
To see the vacant chair, and think,<br />
'How good! how kind! and he is gone.'<br /></p>
<h2>XXI</h2>
<p>I sing to him that rests below,<br />
And, since the grasses round me wave,<br />
I take the grasses of the grave,<br />
And make them pipes whereon to blow.</p>
<p>The traveller hears me now and then,<br />
And sometimes harshly will he speak:<br />
‘This fellow would make weakness weak,<br />
And melt the waxen hearts of men.'</p>
<p>Another answers, ‘Let him be,<br />
He loves to make parade of pain<br />
That with his piping he may gain<br />
The praise that comes to constancy.'</p>
<p>A third is wroth: ‘Is this an hour<br />
For private sorrow's barren song,<br />
When more and more the people throng<br />
The chairs and thrones of civil power?</p>
<p>'A time to sicken and to swoon,<br />
When Science reaches forth her arms<br />
To feel from world to world, and charms<br />
Her secret from the latest moon?'</p>
<p>Behold, ye speak an idle thing:<br />
Ye never knew the sacred dust:<br />
I do but sing because I must,<br />
And pipe but as the linnets sing:</p>
<p>And one is glad; her note is gay,<br />
For now her little ones have ranged;<br />
And one is sad; her note is changed,<br />
Because her brood is stol'n away.<br /></p>
<h2>XXII</h2>
<p>The path by which we twain did go,<br />
Which led by tracts that pleased us well,<br />
Thro' four sweet years arose and fell,<br />
From flower to flower, from snow to snow:</p>
<p>And we with singing cheer'd the way,<br />
And, crown'd with all the season lent,<br />
From April on to April went,<br />
And glad at heart from May to May:</p>
<p>But where the path we walk'd began<br />
To slant the fifth autumnal slope,<br />
As we descended following Hope,<br />
There sat the Shadow fear'd of man;</p>
<p>Who broke our fair companionship,<br />
And spread his mantle dark and cold,<br />
And wrapt thee formless in the fold,<br />
And dull'd the murmur on thy lip,</p>
<p>And bore thee where I could not see<br />
Nor follow, tho' I walk in haste,<br />
And think, that somewhere in the waste<br />
The Shadow sits and waits for me.<br /></p>
<h2>XXIII</h2>
<p>Now, sometimes in my sorrow shut,<br />
Or breaking into song by fits,<br />
Alone, alone, to where he sits,<br />
The Shadow cloak'd from head to foot,</p>
<p>Who keeps the keys of all the creeds,<br />
I wander, often falling lame,<br />
And looking back to whence I came,<br />
Or on to where the pathway leads;</p>
<p>And crying, How changed from where it ran<br />
Thro' lands where not a leaf was dumb;<br />
But all the lavish hills would hum<br />
The murmur of a happy Pan:</p>
<p>When each by turns was guide to each,<br />
And Fancy light from Fancy caught,<br />
And Thought leapt out to wed with Thought<br />
Ere Thought could wed itself with Speech;</p>
<p>And all we met was fair and good,<br />
And all was good that Time could bring,<br />
And all the secret of the Spring<br />
Moved in the chambers of the blood;</p>
<p>And many an old philosophy<br />
On Argive heights divinely sang,<br />
And round us all the thicket rang<br />
To many a flute of Arcady.<br /></p>
<h2>XXIV</h2>
<p>And was the day of my delight<br />
As pure and perfect as I say?<br />
The very source and fount of Day<br />
Is dash'd with wandering isles of night.</p>
<p>If all was good and fair we met,<br />
This earth had been the Paradise<br />
It never look'd to human eyes<br />
Since our first Sun arose and set.</p>
<p>And is it that the haze of grief<br />
Makes former gladness loom so great?<br />
The lowness of the present state,<br />
That sets the past in this relief?</p>
<p>Or that the past will always win<br />
A glory from its being far;<br />
And orb into the perfect star<br />
We saw not, when we moved therein?<br /></p>
<h2>XXV</h2>
<p>I know that this was Life, the track<br />
Whereon with equal feet we fared;<br />
And then, as now, the day prepared<br />
The daily burden for the back.</p>
<p>But this it was that made me move<br />
As light as carrier-birds in air;<br />
I loved the weight I had to bear,<br />
Because it needed help of Love:</p>
<p>Nor could I weary, heart or limb,<br />
When mighty Love would cleave in twain<br />
The lading of a single pain,<br />
And part it, giving half to him.<br /></p>
<h2>XXVI</h2>
<p>Still onward winds the dreary way;<br />
I with it; for I long to prove<br />
No lapse of moons can canker Love,<br />
Whatever fickle tongues may say.</p>
<p>And if that eye which watches guilt<br />
And goodness, and hath power to see<br />
Within the green the moulder'd tree,<br />
And towers fall'n as soon as built?</p>
<p>Oh, if indeed that eye foresee<br />
Or see (in Him is no before)<br />
In more of life true life no more<br />
And Love the indifference to be,</p>
<p>Then might I find, ere yet the morn<br />
Breaks hither over Indian seas,<br />
That Shadow waiting with the keys,<br />
To shroud me from my proper scorn.<br /></p>
<h2>XXVII</h2>
<p>I envy not in any moods<br />
The captive void of noble rage,<br />
The linnet born within the cage,<br />
That never knew the summer woods:</p>
<p>I envy not the beast that takes<br />
His license in the field of time,<br />
Unfetter'd by the sense of crime,<br />
To whom a conscience never wakes;</p>
<p>Nor, what may count itself as blest,<br />
The heart that never plighted troth<br />
But stagnates in the weeds of sloth;<br />
Nor any want-begotten rest.</p>
<p>I hold it true, whate'er befall;<br />
I feel it, when I sorrow most;<br />
'Tis better to have loved and lost<br />
Than never to have loved at all.<br /></p>
<h2>XXVIII</h2>
<p>The time draws near the birth of Christ:<br />
The moon is hid; the night is still;<br />
The Christmas bells from hill to hill<br />
Answer each other in the mist.</p>
<p>Four voices of four hamlets round,<br />
From far and near, on mead and moor,<br />
Swell out and fail, as if a door<br />
Were shut between me and the sound:</p>
<p>Each voice four changes on the wind,<br />
That now dilate, and now decrease,<br />
Peace and goodwill, goodwill and peace,<br />
Peace and goodwill, to all mankind.</p>
<p>This year I slept and woke with pain,<br />
I almost wish'd no more to wake,<br />
And that my hold on life would break<br />
Before I heard those bells again:</p>
<p>But they my troubled spirit rule,<br />
For they controll'd me when a boy;<br />
They bring me sorrow touch'd with joy,<br />
The merry merry bells of Yule.<br /></p>
<h2>XXIX</h2>
<p>With such compelling cause to grieve<br />
As daily vexes household peace,<br />
And chains regret to his decease,<br />
How dare we keep our Christmas-eve;</p>
<p>Which brings no more a welcome guest<br />
To enrich the threshold of the night<br />
With shower'd largess of delight<br />
In dance and song and game and jest?</p>
<p>Yet go, and while the holly boughs<br />
Entwine the cold baptismal font,<br />
Make one wreath more for Use and Wont,<br />
That guard the portals of the house;</p>
<p>Old sisters of a day gone by,<br />
Gray nurses, loving nothing new;<br />
Why should they miss their yearly due<br />
Before their time? They too will die.<br /></p>
<h2>XXX</h2>
<p>With trembling fingers did we weave<br />
The holly round the Chrismas hearth;<br />
A rainy cloud possess'd the earth,<br />
And sadly fell our Christmas-eve.</p>
<p>At our old pastimes in the hall<br />
We gambol'd, making vain pretence<br />
Of gladness, with an awful sense<br />
Of one mute Shadow watching all.</p>
<p>We paused: the winds were in the beech:<br />
We heard them sweep the winter land;<br />
And in a circle hand-in-hand<br />
Sat silent, looking each at each.</p>
<p>Then echo-like our voices rang;<br />
We sung, tho' every eye was dim,<br />
A merry song we sang with him<br />
Last year: impetuously we sang:</p>
<p>We ceased:a gentler feeling crept<br />
Upon us: surely rest is meet:<br />
‘They rest,' we said, ‘their sleep is sweet,'<br />
And silence follow'd, and we wept.</p>
<p>Our voices took a higher range;<br />
Once more we sang: ‘They do not die<br />
Nor lose their mortal sympathy,<br />
Nor change to us, although they change;</p>
<p>'Rapt from the fickle and the frail<br />
With gather'd power, yet the same,<br />
Pierces the keen seraphic flame<br />
From orb to orb, from veil to veil.'</p>
<p>Rise, happy morn, rise, holy morn,<br />
Draw forth the cheerful day from night:<br />
O Father, touch the east, and light<br />
The light that shone when Hope was born.<br /></p>
<h2>XXXI</h2>
<p>When Lazarus left his charnel-cave,<br />
And home to Mary's house return'd,<br />
Was this demanded—if he yearn'd<br />
To hear her weeping by his grave?</p>
<p>'Where wert thou, brother, those four days?'<br />
There lives no record of reply,<br />
Which telling what it is to die<br />
Had surely added praise to praise.</p>
<p>From every house the neighbours met,<br />
The streets were fill'd with joyful sound,<br />
A solemn gladness even crown'd<br />
The purple brows of Olivet.</p>
<p>Behold a man raised up by Christ!<br />
The rest remaineth unreveal'd;<br />
He told it not; or something seal'd<br />
The lips of that Evangelist.<br /></p>
<h2>XXXII</h2>
<p>Her eyes are homes of silent prayer,<br />
Nor other thought her mind admits<br />
But, he was dead, and there he sits,<br />
And he that brought him back is there.</p>
<p>Then one deep love doth supersede<br />
All other, when her ardent gaze<br />
Roves from the living brother's face,<br />
And rests upon the Life indeed.</p>
<p>All subtle thought, all curious fears,<br />
Borne down by gladness so complete,<br />
She bows, she bathes the Saviour's feet<br />
With costly spikenard and with tears.</p>
<p>Thrice blest whose lives are faithful prayers,<br />
Whose loves in higher love endure;<br />
What souls possess themselves so pure,<br />
Or is there blessedness like theirs?<br /></p>
<h2>XXXIII</h2>
<p>O thou that after toil and storm<br />
Mayst seem to have reach'd a purer air,<br />
Whose faith has centre everywhere,<br />
Nor cares to fix itself to form,</p>
<p>Leave thou thy sister when she prays,<br />
Her early Heaven, her happy views;<br />
Nor thou with shadow'd hint confuse<br />
A life that leads melodious days.</p>
<p>Her faith thro' form is pure as thine,<br />
Her hands are quicker unto good:<br />
Oh, sacred be the flesh and blood<br />
To which she links a truth divine!</p>
<p>See thou, that countess reason ripe<br />
In holding by the law within,<br />
Thou fail not in a world of sin,<br />
And ev'n for want of such a type.<br /></p>
<h2>XXXIV</h2>
<p>My own dim life should teach me this,<br />
That life shall live for evermore,<br />
Else earth is darkness at the core,<br />
And dust and ashes all that is;</p>
<p>This round of green, this orb of flame,<br />
Fantastic beauty such as lurks<br />
In some wild Poet, when he works<br />
Without a conscience or an aim.</p>
<p>What then were God to such as I?<br />
'Twere hardly worth my while to choose<br />
Of things all mortal, or to use<br />
A tattle patience ere I die;</p>
<p>'Twere best at once to sink to peace,<br />
Like birds the charming serpent draws,<br />
To drop head-foremost in the jaws<br />
Of vacant darkness and to cease.<br /></p>
<h2>XXXV</h2>
<p>Yet if some voice that man could trust<br />
Should murmur from the narrow house,<br />
‘The cheeks drop in; the body bows;<br />
Man dies: nor is there hope in dust:'</p>
<p>Might I not say? ‘Yet even here,<br />
But for one hour, O Love, I strive<br />
To keep so sweet a thing alive:'<br />
But I should turn mine ears and hear</p>
<p>The moanings of the homeless sea,<br />
The sound of streams that swift or slow<br />
Draw down Æonian hills, and sow<br />
The dust of continents to be;</p>
<p>And Love would answer with a sigh,<br />
‘The sound of that forgetful shore<br />
Will change my sweetness more and more,<br />
Half-dead to know that I shall die.'</p>
<p>O me, what profits it to put<br />
An idle case? If Death were seen<br />
At first as Death, Love had not been,<br />
Or been in narrowest working shut,</p>
<p>Mere fellowship of sluggish moods,<br />
Or in his coarsest Satyr-shape<br />
Had bruised the herb and crush'd the grape,<br />
And bask'd and batten'd in the woods.<br /></p>
<h2>XXXVI</h2>
<p>Tho' truths in manhood darkly join,<br />
Deep-seated in our mystic frame,<br />
We yield all blessing to the name<br />
Of Him that made them current coin;</p>
<p>For Wisdom dealt with mortal powers,<br />
Where truth in closest words shall fail,<br />
When truth embodied in a tale<br />
Shall enter in at lowly doors.</p>
<p>And so the Word had breath, and wrought<br />
With human hands the creed of creeds<br />
In loveliness of perfect deeds,<br />
More strong than all poetic thought;</p>
<p>Which he may read that binds the sheaf,<br />
Or builds the house, or digs the grave,<br />
And those wild eyes that watch the wave<br />
In roarings round the coral reef.<br /></p>
<h2>XXXVII</h2>
<p>Urania speaks with darken'd brow:<br />
‘Thou pratest here where thou art least;<br />
This faith has many a purer priest,<br />
And many an abler voice than thou.</p>
<p>'Go down beside thy native rill,<br />
On thy Parnassus set thy feet,<br />
And hear thy laurel whisper sweet<br />
About the ledges of the hill.'</p>
<p>And my Melpomene replies,<br />
A touch of shame upon her cheek:<br />
‘I am not worthy ev'n to speak<br />
Of thy prevailing mysteries;</p>
<p>'For I am but an earthly Muse,<br />
And owning but a little art<br />
To lull with song an aching heart,<br />
And render human love his dues;</p>
<p>'But brooding on the dear one dead,<br />
And all he said of things divine,<br />
(And dear to me as sacred wine<br />
To dying lips is all he said),</p>
<p>'I murmur'd, as I came along,<br />
Of comfort clasp'd in truth reveal'd;<br />
And loiter'd in the master's field,<br />
And darken'd sanctities with song.'<br /></p>
<h2>XXXVIII</h2>
<p>With weary steps I loiter on,<br />
Tho' always under alter'd skies<br />
The purple from the distance dies,<br />
My prospect and horizon gone.</p>
<p>No joy the blowing season gives,<br />
The herald melodies of spring,<br />
But in the songs I love to sing<br />
A doubtful gleam of solace lives.</p>
<p>If any care for what is here<br />
Survive in spirits render'd free,<br />
Then are these songs I sing of thee<br />
Not all ungrateful to thine ear.<br /></p>
<h2>XXXIX</h2>
<p>Old warder of these buried bones,<br />
And answering now my random stroke<br />
With fruitful cloud and living smoke,<br />
Dark yew, that graspest at the stones</p>
<p>And dippest toward the dreamless head,<br />
To thee too comes the golden hour<br />
When flower is feeling after flower;<br />
But Sorrow?fixt upon the dead,</p>
<p>And darkening the dark graves of men,?<br />
What whisper'd from her lying lips?<br />
Thy gloom is kindled at the tips,<br />
And passes into gloom again.<br /></p>
<h2>XL</h2>
<p>Could we forget the widow'd hour<br />
And look on Spirits breathed away,<br />
As on a maiden in the day<br />
When first she wears her orange-flower!</p>
<p>When crown'd with blessing she doth rise<br />
To take her latest leave of home,<br />
And hopes and light regrets that come<br />
Make April of her tender eyes;</p>
<p>And doubtful joys the father move,<br />
And tears are on the mother's face,<br />
As parting with a long embrace<br />
She enters other realms of love;</p>
<p>Her office there to rear, to teach,<br />
Becoming as is meet and fit<br />
A link among the days, to knit<br />
The generations each with each;</p>
<p>And, doubtless, unto thee is given<br />
A life that bears immortal fruit<br />
In those great offices that suit<br />
The full-grown energies of heaven.</p>
<p>Ay me, the difference I discern!<br />
How often shall her old fireside<br />
Be cheer'd with tidings of the bride,<br />
How often she herself return,</p>
<p>And tell them all they would have told,<br />
And bring her babe, and make her boast,<br />
Till even those that miss'd her most<br />
Shall count new things as dear as old:</p>
<p>But thou and I have shaken hands,<br />
Till growing winters lay me low;<br />
My paths are in the fields I know.<br />
And thine in undiscover'd lands.<br /></p>
<h2>XLI</h2>
<p>Thy spirit ere our fatal loss<br />
Did ever rise from high to higher;<br />
As mounts the heavenward altar-fire,<br />
As flies the lighter thro' the gross.</p>
<p>But thou art turn'd to something strange,<br />
And I have lost the links that bound<br />
Thy changes; here upon the ground,<br />
No more partaker of thy change.</p>
<p>Deep folly! yet that this could be?<br />
That I could wing my will with might<br />
To leap the grades of life and light,<br />
And flash at once, my friend, to thee.</p>
<p>For tho' my nature rarely yields<br />
To that vague fear implied in death;<br />
Nor shudders at the gulfs beneath,<br />
The howlings from forgotten fields;</p>
<p>Yet oft when sundown skirts the moor<br />
An inner trouble I behold,<br />
A spectral doubt which makes me cold,<br />
That I shall be thy mate no more,</p>
<p>Tho' following with an upward mind<br />
The wonders that have come to thee,<br />
Thro' all the secular to-be,<br />
But evermore a life behind.<br /></p>
<h2>XLII</h2>
<p>I vex my heart with fancies dim:<br />
He still outstript me in the race;<br />
It was but unity of place<br />
That made me dream I rank'd with him.</p>
<p>And so may Place retain us still,<br />
And he the much-beloved again,<br />
A lord of large experience, train<br />
To riper growth the mind and will:</p>
<p>And what delights can equal those<br />
That stir the spirit's inner deeps,<br />
When one that loves but knows not, reaps<br />
A truth from one that loves and knows?<br /></p>
<h2>XLIII</h2>
<p>If Sleep and Death be truly one,<br />
And every spirit's folded bloom<br />
Thro' all its intervital gloom<br />
In some long trance should slumber on;</p>
<p>Unconscious of the sliding hour,<br />
Bare of the body, might it last,<br />
And silent traces of the past<br />
Be all the colour of the flower:</p>
<p>So then were nothing lost to man;<br />
So that still garden of the souls<br />
In many a figured leaf enrolls<br />
The total world since life began;</p>
<p>And love will last as pure and whole<br />
As when he loved me here in Time,<br />
And at the spiritual prime<br />
Rewaken with the dawning soul.<br /></p>
<h2>XLIV</h2>
<p>How fares it with the happy dead?<br />
For here the man is more and more;<br />
But he forgets the days before<br />
God shut the doorways of his head.</p>
<p>The days have vanish'd, tone and tint,<br />
And yet perhaps the hoarding sense<br />
Gives out at times (he knows not whence)<br />
A little flash, a mystic hint;</p>
<p>And in the long harmonious years<br />
(If Death so taste Lethean springs<br />
May some dim touch of earthly things)<br />
Surprise thee ranging with thy peers.</p>
<p>If such a dreamy touch should fall,<br />
O, turn thee round, resolve the doubt;<br />
My guardian angel will speak out<br />
In that high place, and tell thee all.<br /></p>
<h2>XLV</h2>
<p>The baby new to earth and sky,<br />
What time his tender palm is prest<br />
Against the circle of the breast,<br />
Has never thought that ‘this is I:'</p>
<p>But as he grows he gathers much,<br />
And learns the use of ‘I' and ‘me,'<br />
And finds ‘I am not what I see,<br />
And other than the things I touch.'</p>
<p>So rounds he to a separate mind<br />
From whence clear memory may begin,<br />
As thro' the frame that binds him in<br />
His isolation grows defined.</p>
<p>This use may lie in blood and breath,<br />
Which else were fruitless of their due,<br />
Had man to learn himself anew<br />
Beyond the second birth of Death.<br /></p>
<h2>XLVI</h2>
<p>We ranging down this lower track,<br />
The path we came by, thorn and flower,<br />
Is shadow'd by the growing hour,<br />
Lest life should fail in looking back.</p>
<p>So be it: there no shade can last<br />
In that deep dawn behind the tomb,<br />
But clear from marge to marge shall bloom<br />
The eternal landscape of the past;</p>
<p>A lifelong tract of time reveal'd;<br />
The fruitful hours of still increase;<br />
Days order'd in a wealthy peace,<br />
And those five years its richest field.</p>
<p>O Love, thy province were not large,<br />
A bounded field, nor stretching far;<br />
Look also, Love, a brooding star,<br />
A rosy warmth from marge to marge.<br /></p>
<h2>XLVII</h2>
<p>That each, who seems a separate whole,<br />
Should move his rounds, and fusing all<br />
The skirts of self again, should fall<br />
Remerging in the general Soul,</p>
<p>Is faith as vague as all unsweet:<br />
Eternal form shall still divide<br />
The eternal soul from all beside;<br />
And I shall know him when we meet:</p>
<p>And we shall sit at endless feast,<br />
Enjoying each the other's good:<br />
What vaster dream can hit the mood<br />
Of Love on earth? He seeks at least</p>
<p>Upon the last and sharpest height,<br />
Before the spirits fade away,<br />
Some landing-place, to clasp and say,<br />
'Farewell! We lose ourselves in light.'<br /></p>
<h2>XLVIII</h2>
<p>If these brief lays, of Sorrow born,<br />
Were taken to be such as closed<br />
Grave doubts and answers here proposed,<br />
Then these were such as men might scorn:</p>
<p>Her care is not to part and prove;<br />
She takes, when harsher moods remit,<br />
What slender shade of doubt may flit,<br />
And makes it vassal unto love:</p>
<p>And hence, indeed, she sports with words,<br />
But better serves a wholesome law,<br />
And holds it sin and shame to draw<br />
The deepest measure from the chords:</p>
<p>Nor dare she trust a larger lay,<br />
But rather loosens from the lip<br />
Short swallow-flights of song, that dip<br />
Their wings in tears, and skim away.<br /></p>
<h2>XLIX</h2>
<p>From art, from nature, from the schools,<br />
Let random influences glance,<br />
Like light in many a shiver'd lance<br />
That breaks about the dappled pools:</p>
<p>The lightest wave of thought shall lisp,<br />
The fancy's tenderest eddy wreathe,<br />
The slightest air of song shall breathe<br />
To make the sullen surface crisp.</p>
<p>And look thy look, and go thy way,<br />
But blame not thou the winds that make<br />
The seeming-wanton ripple break,<br />
The tender-pencil'd shadow play.</p>
<p>Beneath all fancied hopes and fears<br />
Ay me, the sorrow deepens down.<br />
Whose muffled motions blindly drown<br />
The bases of my life in tears.<br /></p>
<h2>L</h2>
<p>Be near me when my light is low,<br />
When the blood creeps, and the nerves prick<br />
And tingle; and the heart is sick,<br />
And all the wheels of Being slow.</p>
<p>Be near me when the sensuous frame<br />
Is rack'd with pangs that conquer trust;<br />
And Time, a maniac scattering dust,<br />
And Life, a Fury slinging flame.</p>
<p>Be near me when my faith is dry,<br />
And men the flies of latter spring,<br />
That lay their eggs, and sting and sing<br />
And weave their petty cells and die.</p>
<p>Be near me when I fade away,<br />
To point the term of human strife,<br />
And on the low dark verge of life<br />
The twilight of eternal day.<br /></p>
<h2>LI</h2>
<p>Do we indeed desire the dead<br />
Should still be near us at our side?<br />
Is there no baseness we would hide?<br />
No inner vileness that we dread?</p>
<p>Shall he for whose applause I strove,<br />
I had such reverence for his blame,<br />
See with clear eye some hidden shame<br />
And I be lessen'd in his love?</p>
<p>I wrong the grave with fears untrue:<br />
Shall love be blamed for want of faith?<br />
There must be wisdom with great Death:<br />
The dead shall look me thro' and thro'.</p>
<p>Be near us when we climb or fall:<br />
Ye watch, like God, the rolling hours<br />
With larger other eyes than ours,<br />
To make allowance for us all.<br /></p>
<h2>LII</h2>
<p>I cannot love thee as I ought,<br />
For love reflects the thing beloved;<br />
My words are only words, and moved<br />
Upon the topmost froth of thought.</p>
<p>'Yet blame not thou thy plaintive song,'<br />
The Spirit of true love replied;<br />
‘Thou canst not move me from thy side,<br />
Nor human frailty do me wrong.</p>
<p>'What keeps a spirit wholly true<br />
To that ideal which he bears?<br />
What record? not the sinless years<br />
That breathed beneath the Syrian blue:</p>
<p>'So fret not, like an idle girl,<br />
That life is dash'd with flecks of sin.<br />
Abide: thy wealth is gather'd in,<br />
When Time hath sunder'd shell from pearl.'<br /></p>
<h2>LIII</h2>
<p>How many a father have I seen,<br />
A sober man, among his boys,<br />
Whose youth was full of foolish noise,<br />
Who wears his manhood hale and green:</p>
<p>And dare we to this fancy give,<br />
That had the wild oat not been sown,<br />
The soil, left barren, scarce had grown<br />
The grain by which a man may live?</p>
<p>Or, if we held the doctrine sound<br />
For life outliving heats of youth,<br />
Yet who would preach it as a truth<br />
To those that eddy round and round?</p>
<p>Hold thou the good: define it well:<br />
For fear divine Philosophy<br />
Should push beyond her mark, and be<br />
Procuress to the Lords of Hell.<br /></p>
<h2>LIV</h2>
<p>Oh yet we trust that somehow good<br />
Will be the final goal of ill,<br />
To pangs of nature, sins of will,<br />
Defects of doubt, and taints of blood;</p>
<p>That nothing walks with aimless feet;<br />
That not one life shall be destroy'd,<br />
Or cast as rubbish to the void,<br />
When God hath made the pile complete;</p>
<p>That not a worm is cloven in vain;<br />
That not a moth with vain desire<br />
Is shrivell'd in a fruitless fire,<br />
Or but subserves another's gain.</p>
<p>Behold, we know not anything;<br />
I can but trust that good shall fall<br />
At last--far off--at last, to all,<br />
And every winter change to spring.</p>
<p>So runs my dream: but what am I?<br />
An infant crying in the night:<br />
An infant crying for the light:<br />
And with no language but a cry.<br /></p>
<h2>LV</h2>
<p>The wish, that of the living whole<br />
No life may fail beyond the grave,<br />
Derives it not from what we have<br />
The likest God within the soul?</p>
<p>Are God and Nature then at strife,<br />
That Nature lends such evil dreams?<br />
So careful of the type she seems,<br />
So careless of the single life;</p>
<p>That I, considering everywhere<br />
Her secret meaning in her deeds,<br />
And finding that of fifty seeds<br />
She often brings but one to bear,</p>
<p>I falter where I firmly trod,<br />
And falling with my weight of cares<br />
Upon the great world's altar-stairs<br />
That slope thro' darkness up to God,</p>
<p>I stretch lame hands of faith, and grope,<br />
And gather dust and chaff, and call<br />
To what I feel is Lord of all,<br />
And faintly trust the larger hope.<br /></p>
<h2>LVI</h2>
<p>'So careful of the type?' but no.<br />
From scarped cliff and quarried stone<br />
She cries, ‘A thousand types are gone:<br />
I care for nothing, all shall go.</p>
<p>'Thou makest thine appeal to me:<br />
I bring to life, I bring to death:<br />
The spirit does but mean the breath:<br />
I know no more.' And he, shall he,</p>
<p>Man, her last work, who seem'd so fair,<br />
Such splendid purpose in his eyes,<br />
Who roll'd the psalm to wintry skies,<br />
Who built him fanes of fruitless prayer,</p>
<p>Who trusted God was love indeed<br />
And love Creation's final law?<br />
Tho' Nature, red in tooth and claw<br />
With ravine, shriek'd against his creed?</p>
<p>Who loved, who suffer'd countless ills,<br />
Who battled for the True, the Just,<br />
Be blown about the desert dust,<br />
Or seal'd within the iron hills?</p>
<p>No more? A monster then, a dream,<br />
A discord. Dragons of the prime,<br />
That tare each other in their slime,<br />
Were mellow music match'd with him.</p>
<p>O life as futile, then, as frail!<br />
O for thy voice to soothe and bless!<br />
What hope of answer, or redress?<br />
Behind the veil, behind the veil.<br /></p>
<h2>LVII</h2>
<p>Peace; come away: the song of woe<br />
Is after all an earthly song:<br />
Peace; come away: we do him wrong<br />
To sing so wildly: let us go.</p>
<p>Come; let us go: your cheeks are pale;<br />
But half my life I leave behind:<br />
Methinks my friend is richly shrined;<br />
But I shall pass; my work will fail.</p>
<p>Yet in these ears, till hearing dies,<br />
One set slow bell will seem to toll<br />
The passing of the sweetest soul<br />
That ever look'd with human eyes.</p>
<p>I hear it now, and o'er and o'er,<br />
Eternal greetings to the dead;<br />
And ‘Ave, Ave, Ave,' said,<br />
'Adieu, adieu,' for evermore.<br /></p>
<h2>LVIII</h2>
<p>In those sad words I took farewell:<br />
Like echoes in sepulchral halls,<br />
As drop by drop the water falls<br />
In vaults and catacombs, they fell;</p>
<p>And, falling, idly broke the peace<br />
Of hearts that beat from day to day,<br />
Half-conscious of their dying clay,<br />
And those cold crypts where they shall cease.</p>
<p>The high Muse answer'd: ‘Wherefore grieve<br />
Thy brethren with a fruitless tear?<br />
Abide a little longer here,<br />
And thou shalt take a nobler leave.'<br /></p>
<h2>LIX</h2>
<p>O Sorrow, wilt thou live with me<br />
No casual mistress, but a wife,<br />
My bosom-friend and half of life;<br />
As I confess it needs must be;</p>
<p>O Sorrow, wilt thou rule my blood,<br />
Be sometimes lovely like a bride,<br />
And put thy harsher moods aside,<br />
If thou wilt have me wise and good.</p>
<p>My centred passion cannot move,<br />
Nor will it lessen from to-day;<br />
But I'll have leave at times to play<br />
As with the creature of my love;</p>
<p>And set thee forth, for thou art mine,<br />
With so much hope for years to come,<br />
That, howsoe'er I know thee, some<br />
Could hardly tell what name were thine.<br /></p>
<h2>LX</h2>
<p>He past; a soul of nobler tone:<br />
My spirit loved and loves him yet,<br />
Like some poor girl whose heart is set<br />
On one whose rank exceeds her own.</p>
<p>He mixing with his proper sphere,<br />
She finds the baseness of her lot,<br />
Half jealous of she knows not what,<br />
And envying all that meet him there.</p>
<p>The little village looks forlorn;<br />
She sighs amid her narrow days,<br />
Moving about the household ways,<br />
In that dark house where she was born.</p>
<p>The foolish neighbors come and go,<br />
And tease her till the day draws by:<br />
At night she weeps, ‘How vain am I!'<br />
How should he love a thing so low?'<br /></p>
<h2>LXI</h2>
<p>If, in thy second state sublime,<br />
Thy ransom'd reason change replies<br />
With all the circle of the wise,<br />
The perfect flower of human time;</p>
<p>And if thou cast thine eyes below,<br />
How dimly character'd and slight,<br />
How dwarf'd a growth of cold and night,<br />
How blanch'd with darkness must I grow!</p>
<p>Yet turn thee to the doubtful shore,<br />
Where thy first form was made a man;<br />
I loved thee, Spirit, and love, nor can<br />
The soul of Shakspeare love thee more.<br /></p>
<h2>LXII</h2>
<p>Tho' if an eye that's downward cast<br />
Could make thee somewhat blench or fail,<br />
Then be my love an idle tale,<br />
And fading legend of the past;</p>
<p>And thou, as one that once declined,<br />
When he was little more than boy,<br />
On some unworthy heart with joy,<br />
But lives to wed an equal mind;</p>
<p>And breathes a novel world, the while<br />
His other passion wholly dies,<br />
Or in the light of deeper eyes<br />
Is matter for a flying smile.<br /></p>
<h2>LXIII</h2>
<p>Yet pity for a horse o'er-driven,<br />
And love in which my hound has part,<br />
Can hang no weight upon my heart<br />
In its assumptions up to heaven;</p>
<p>And I am so much more than these,<br />
As thou, perchance, art more than I,<br />
And yet I spare them sympathy,<br />
And I would set their pains at ease.</p>
<p>So mayst thou watch me where I weep,<br />
As, unto vaster motions bound,<br />
The circuits of thine orbit round<br />
A higher height, a deeper deep.<br /></p>
<h2>LXIV</h2>
<p>Dost thou look back on what hath been,<br />
As some divinely gifted man,<br />
Whose life in low estate began<br />
And on a simple village green;</p>
<p>Who breaks his birth's invidious bar,<br />
And grasps the skirts of happy chance,<br />
And breasts the blows of circumstance,<br />
And grapples with his evil star;</p>
<p>Who makes by force his merit known<br />
And lives to clutch the golden keys,<br />
To mould a mighty state's decrees,<br />
And shape the whisper of the throne;</p>
<p>And moving up from high to higher,<br />
Becomes on Fortune's crowning slope<br />
The pillar of a people's hope,<br />
The centre of a world's desire;</p>
<p>Yet feels, as in a pensive dream,<br />
When all his active powers are still,<br />
A distant dearness in the hill,<br />
A secret sweetness in the stream,</p>
<p>The limit of his narrower fate,<br />
While yet beside its vocal springs<br />
He play'd at counsellors and kings,<br />
With one that was his earliest mate;</p>
<p>Who ploughs with pain his native lea<br />
And reaps the labour of his hands,<br />
Or in the furrow musing stands;<br />
'Does my old friend remember me?'<br /></p>
<h2>LXV</h2>
<p>Sweet soul, do with me as thou wilt;<br />
I lull a fancy trouble-tost<br />
With ‘Love's too precious to be lost,<br />
A little grain shall not be spilt.'</p>
<p>And in that solace can I sing,<br />
Till out of painful phases wrought<br />
There flutters up a happy thought,<br />
Self-balanced on a lightsome wing:</p>
<p>Since we deserved the name of friends,<br />
And thine effect so lives in me,<br />
A part of mine may live in thee<br />
And move thee on to noble ends.<br /></p>
<h2>LXVI</h2>
<p>You thought my heart too far diseased;<br />
You wonder when my fancies play<br />
To find me gay among the gay,<br />
Like one with any trifle pleased.</p>
<p>The shade by which my life was crost,<br />
Which makes a desert in the mind,<br />
Has made me kindly with my kind,<br />
And like to him whose sight is lost;</p>
<p>Whose feet are guided thro' the land,<br />
Whose jest among his friends is free,<br />
Who takes the children on his knee,<br />
And winds their curls about his hand:</p>
<p>He plays with threads, he beats his chair<br />
For pastime, dreaming of the sky;<br />
His inner day can never die,<br />
His night of loss is always there.<br /></p>
<h2>LXVII</h2>
<p>When on my bed the moonlight falls,<br />
I know that in thy place of rest<br />
By that broad water of the west,<br />
There comes a glory on the walls;</p>
<p>Thy marble bright in dark appears,<br />
As slowly steals a silver flame<br />
Along the letters of thy name,<br />
And o'er the number of thy years.</p>
<p>The mystic glory swims away;<br />
From off my bed the moonlight dies;<br />
And closing eaves of wearied eyes<br />
I sleep till dusk is dipt in gray;</p>
<p>And then I know the mist is drawn<br />
A lucid veil from coast to coast,<br />
And in the dark church like a ghost<br />
Thy tablet glimmers to the dawn.<br /></p>
<h2>LXVIII</h2>
<p>When in the down I sink my head,<br />
Sleep, Death's twin-brother, times my breath;<br />
Sleep, Death's twin-brother, knows not Death,<br />
Nor can I dream of thee as dead:</p>
<p>I walk as ere I walk'd forlorn,<br />
When all our path was fresh with dew,<br />
And all the bugle breezes blew<br />
Reveillée to the breaking morn.</p>
<p>But what is this? I turn about,<br />
I find a trouble in thine eye,<br />
Which makes me sad I know not why,<br />
Nor can my dream resolve the doubt:</p>
<p>But ere the lark hath left the lea<br />
I wake, and I discern the truth;<br />
It is the trouble of my youth<br />
That foolish sleep transfers to thee.<br /></p>
<h2>LXIX</h2>
<p>I dream'd there would be Spring no more,<br />
That Nature's ancient power was lost:<br />
The streets were black with smoke and frost,<br />
They chatter'd trifles at the door:</p>
<p>I wander'd from the noisy town,<br />
I found a wood with thorny boughs:<br />
I took the thorns to bind my brows,<br />
I wore them like a civic crown:</p>
<p>I met with scoffs, I met with scorns<br />
From youth and babe and hoary hairs:<br />
They call'd me in the public squares<br />
The fool that wears a crown of thorns:</p>
<p>They call'd me fool, they call'd me child:<br />
I found an angel of the night;<br />
The voice was low, the look was bright;<br />
He look'd upon my crown and smiled:</p>
<p>He reach'd the glory of a hand,<br />
That seem'd to touch it into leaf:<br />
The voice was not the voice of grief,<br />
The words were hard to understand.<br /></p>
<h2>LXX</h2>
<p>I cannot see the features right,<br />
When on the gloom I strive to paint<br />
The face I know; the hues are faint<br />
And mix with hollow masks of night;</p>
<p>Cloud-towers by ghostly masons wrought,<br />
A gulf that ever shuts and gapes,<br />
A hand that points, and palled shapes<br />
In shadowy thoroughfares of thought;</p>
<p>And crowds that stream from yawning doors,<br />
And shoals of pucker'd faces drive;<br />
Dark bulks that tumble half alive,<br />
And lazy lengths on boundless shores;</p>
<p>Till all at once beyond the will<br />
I hear a wizard music roll,<br />
And thro' a lattice on the soul<br />
Looks thy fair face and makes it still.<br /></p>
<h2>LXXI</h2>
<p>Sleep, kinsman thou to death and trance<br />
And madness, thou hast forged at last<br />
A night-long Present of the Past<br />
In which we went thro' summer France.</p>
<p>Hadst thou such credit with the soul?<br />
Then bring an opiate trebly strong,<br />
Drug down the blindfold sense of wrong<br />
That so my pleasure may be whole;</p>
<p>While now we talk as once we talk'd<br />
Of men and minds, the dust of change,<br />
The days that grow to something strange,<br />
In walking as of old we walk'd</p>
<p>Beside the river's wooded reach,<br />
The fortress, and the mountain ridge,<br />
The cataract flashing from the bridge,<br />
The breaker breaking on the beach.<br /></p>
<h2>LXXII</h2>
<p>Risest thou thus, dim dawn, again,<br />
And howlest, issuing out of night,<br />
With blasts that blow the poplar white,<br />
And lash with storm the streaming pane?</p>
<p>Day, when my crown'd estate begun<br />
To pine in that reverse of doom,<br />
Which sicken'd every living bloom,<br />
And blurr'd the splendour of the sun;</p>
<p>Who usherest in the dolorous hour<br />
With thy quick tears that make the rose<br />
Pull sideways, and the daisy close<br />
Her crimson fringes to the shower;</p>
<p>Who might'st have heaved a windless flame<br />
Up the deep East, or, whispering, play'd<br />
A chequer-work of beam and shade<br />
Along the hills, yet look'd the same.</p>
<p>As wan, as chill, as wild as now;<br />
Day, mark'd as with some hideous crime,<br />
When the dark hand struck down thro' time,<br />
And cancell'd nature's best: but thou,</p>
<p>Lift as thou may'st thy burthen'd brows<br />
Thro' clouds that drench the morning star,<br />
And whirl the ungarner'd sheaf afar,<br />
And sow the sky with flying boughs,</p>
<p>And up thy vault with roaring sound<br />
Climb thy thick noon, disastrous day;<br />
Touch thy dull goal of joyless gray,<br />
And hide thy shame beneath the ground.<br /></p>
<h2>LXXIII</h2>
<p>So many worlds, so much to do,<br />
So little done, such things to be,<br />
How know I what had need of thee,<br />
For thou wert strong as thou wert true?</p>
<p>The fame is quench'd that I foresaw,<br />
The head hath miss'd an earthly wreath:<br />
I curse not Nature, no, nor Death;<br />
For nothing is that errs from law.</p>
<p>We pass; the path that each man trod<br />
Is dim, or will be dim, with weeds:<br />
What fame is left for human deeds<br />
In endless age? It rests with God.</p>
<p>O hollow wraith of dying fame,<br />
Fade wholly, while the soul exults,<br />
And self-infolds the large results<br />
Of force that would have forged a name.<br /></p>
<h2>LXXIV</h2>
<p>As sometimes in a dead man's face,<br />
To those that watch it more and more,<br />
A likeness, hardly seen before,<br />
Comes out--to some one of his race:</p>
<p>So, dearest, now thy brows are cold,<br />
I see thee what thou art, and know<br />
Thy likeness to the wise below,<br />
Thy kindred with the great of old.</p>
<p>But there is more than I can see,<br />
And what I see I leave unsaid,<br />
Nor speak it, knowing Death has made<br />
His darkness beautiful with thee.</p>
<h2>LXXV</h2>
<p>I leave thy praises unexpress'd<br />
In verse that brings myself relief,<br />
And by the measure of my grief<br />
I leave thy greatness to be guess'd;</p>
<p>What practice howsoe'er expert<br />
In fitting aptest words to things,<br />
Or voice the richest-toned that sings,<br />
Hath power to give thee as thou wert?</p>
<p>I care not in these fading days<br />
To raise a cry that lasts not long,<br />
And round thee with the breeze of song<br />
To stir a little dust of praise.</p>
<p>Thy leaf has perish'd in the green,<br />
And, while we breathe beneath the sun,<br />
The world which credits what is done<br />
Is cold to all that might have been.</p>
<p>So here shall silence guard thy fame;<br />
But somewhere, out of human view,<br />
Whate'er thy hands are set to do<br />
Is wrought with tumult of acclaim.<br /></p>
<h2>LXXVI</h2>
<p>Take wings of fancy, and ascend,<br />
And in a moment set thy face<br />
Where all the starry heavens of space<br />
Are sharpen'd to a needle's end;</p>
<p>Take wings of foresight; lighten thro'<br />
The secular abyss to come,<br />
And lo, thy deepest lays are dumb<br />
Before the mouldering of a yew;</p>
<p>And if the matin songs, that woke<br />
The darkness of our planet, last,<br />
Thine own shall wither in the vast,<br />
Ere half the lifetime of an oak.</p>
<p>Ere these have clothed their branchy bowers<br />
With fifty Mays, thy songs are vain;<br />
And what are they when these remain<br />
The ruin'd shells of hollow towers?<br /></p>
<h2>LXXVII</h2>
<p>What hope is here for modern rhyme<br />
To him, who turns a musing eye<br />
On songs, and deeds, and lives, that lie<br />
Foreshorten'd in the tract of time?</p>
<p>These mortal lullabies of pain<br />
May bind a book, may line a box,<br />
May serve to curl a maiden's locks;<br />
Or when a thousand moons shall wane</p>
<p>A man upon a stall may find,<br />
And, passing, turn the page that tells<br />
A grief, then changed to something else,<br />
Sung by a long-forgotten mind.</p>
<p>But what of that? My darken'd ways<br />
Shall ring with music all the same;<br />
To breathe my loss is more than fame,<br />
To utter love more sweet than praise.<br /></p>
<h2>LXXVIII</h2>
<p>Again at Christmas did we weave<br />
The holly round the Christmas hearth;<br />
The silent snow possess'd the earth,<br />
And calmly fell our Christmas-eve:</p>
<p>The yule-clog sparkled keen with frost,<br />
No wing of wind the region swept,<br />
But over all things brooding slept<br />
The quiet sense of something lost.</p>
<p>As in the winters left behind,<br />
Again our ancient games had place,<br />
The mimic picture's breathing grace,<br />
And dance and song and hoodman-blind.</p>
<p>Who show'd a token of distress?<br />
No single tear, no mark of pain:<br />
O sorrow, then can sorrow wane?<br />
O grief, can grief be changed to less?</p>
<p>O last regret, regret can die!<br />
No--mixt with all this mystic frame,<br />
Her deep relations are the same,<br />
But with long use her tears are dry.<br /></p>
<h2>LXXIX</h2>
<p>'More than my brothers are to me,'?<br />
Let this not vex thee, noble heart!<br />
I know thee of what force thou art<br />
To hold the costliest love in fee.</p>
<p>But thou and I are one in kind,<br />
As moulded like in Nature's mint;<br />
And hill and wood and field did print<br />
The same sweet forms in either mind.</p>
<p>For us the same cold streamlet curl'd<br />
Thro' all his eddying coves, the same<br />
All winds that roam the twilight came<br />
In whispers of the beauteous world.</p>
<p>At one dear knee we proffer'd vows,<br />
One lesson from one book we learn'd,<br />
Ere childhood's flaxen ringlet turn'd<br />
To black and brown on kindred brows.</p>
<p>And so my wealth resembles thine,<br />
But he was rich where I was poor,<br />
And he supplied my want the more<br />
As his unlikeness fitted mine.<br /></p>
<h2>LXXX</h2>
<p>If any vague desire should rise,<br />
That holy Death ere Arthur died<br />
Had moved me kindly from his side,<br />
And dropt the dust on tearless eyes;</p>
<p>Then fancy shapes, as fancy can,<br />
The grief my loss in him had wrought,<br />
A grief as deep as life or thought,<br />
But stay'd in peace with God and man.</p>
<p>I make a picture in the brain;<br />
I hear the sentence that he speaks;<br />
He bears the burthen of the weeks<br />
But turns his burthen into gain.</p>
<p>His credit thus shall set me free;<br />
And, influence-rich to soothe and save,<br />
Unused example from the grave<br />
Reach out dead hands to comfort me.<br /></p>
<h2>LXXXI</h2>
<p>Could I have said while he was here,<br />
‘My love shall now no further range;<br />
There cannot come a mellower change,<br />
For now is love mature in ear'?</p>
<p>Love, then, had hope of richer store:<br />
What end is here to my complaint?<br />
This haunting whisper makes me faint,<br />
'More years had made me love thee more.'</p>
<p>But Death returns an answer sweet:<br />
‘My sudden frost was sudden gain,<br />
And gave all ripeness to the grain,<br />
It might have drawn from after-heat.'<br /></p>
<h2>LXXXII</h2>
<p>I wage not any feud with Death<br />
For changes wrought on form and face;<br />
No lower life that earth's embrace<br />
May breed with him, can fright my faith.</p>
<p>Eternal process moving on,<br />
From state to state the spirit walks;<br />
And these are but the shatter'd stalks,<br />
Or ruin'd chrysalis of one.</p>
<p>Nor blame I Death, because he bare<br />
The use of virtue out of earth:<br />
I know transplanted human worth<br />
Will bloom to profit, otherwhere.</p>
<p>For this alone on Death I wreak<br />
The wrath that garners in my heart;<br />
He put our lives so far apart<br />
We cannot hear each other speak.<br /></p>
<h2>LXXXIII</h2>
<p>Dip down upon the northern shore,<br />
O sweet new-year delaying long;<br />
Thou doest expectant nature wrong;<br />
Delaying long, delay no more.</p>
<p>What stays thee from the clouded noons,<br />
Thy sweetness from its proper place?<br />
Can trouble live with April days,<br />
Or sadness in the summer moons?</p>
<p>Bring orchis, bring the foxglove spire,<br />
The little speedwell's darling blue,<br />
Deep tulips dash'd with fiery dew,<br />
Laburnums, dropping-wells of fire.</p>
<p>O thou, new-year, delaying long,<br />
Delayest the sorrow in my blood,<br />
That longs to burst a frozen bud<br />
And flood a fresher throat with song.<br /></p>
<h2>LXXXIV</h2>
<p>When I contemplate all alone<br />
The life that had been thine below,<br />
And fix my thoughts on all the glow<br />
To which thy crescent would have grown;</p>
<p>I see thee sitting crown'd with good,<br />
A central warmth diffusing bliss<br />
In glance and smile, and clasp and kiss,<br />
On all the branches of thy blood;</p>
<p>Thy blood, my friend, and partly mine;<br />
For now the day was drawing on,<br />
When thou should'st link thy life with one<br />
Of mine own house, and boys of thine</p>
<p>Had babbled ‘Uncle' on my knee;<br />
But that remorseless iron hour<br />
Made cypress of her orange flower,<br />
Despair of Hope, and earth of thee.</p>
<p>I seem to meet their least desire,<br />
To clap their cheeks, to call them mine.<br />
I see their unborn faces shine<br />
Beside the never-lighted fire.</p>
<p>I see myself an honor'd guest,<br />
Thy partner in the flowery walk<br />
Of letters, genial table-talk,<br />
Or deep dispute, and graceful jest;</p>
<p>While now thy prosperous labor fills<br />
The lips of men with honest praise,<br />
And sun by sun the happy days<br />
Descend below the golden hills</p>
<p>With promise of a morn as fair;<br />
And all the train of bounteous hours<br />
Conduct by paths of growing powers,<br />
To reverence and the silver hair;</p>
<p>Till slowly worn her earthly robe,<br />
Her lavish mission richly wrought,<br />
Leaving great legacies of thought,<br />
Thy spirit should fail from off the globe;</p>
<p>What time mine own might also flee,<br />
As link'd with thine in love and fate,<br />
And, hovering o'er the dolorous strait<br />
To the other shore, involved in thee,</p>
<p>Arrive at last the blessed goal,<br />
And He that died in Holy Land<br />
Would reach us out the shining hand,<br />
And take us as a single soul.</p>
<p>What reed was that on which I leant?<br />
Ah, backward fancy, wherefore wake<br />
The old bitterness again, and break<br />
The low beginnings of content.<br /></p>
<h2>LXXXV</h2>
<p>This truth came borne with bier and pall,<br />
I felt it, when I sorrow'd most,<br />
'Tis better to have loved and lost,<br />
Than never to have loved at all--</p>
<p>O true in word, and tried in deed,<br />
Demanding, so to bring relief<br />
To this which is our common grief,<br />
What kind of life is that I lead;</p>
<p>And whether trust in things above<br />
Be dimm'd of sorrow, or sustain'd;<br />
And whether love for him have drain'd<br />
My capabilities of love;</p>
<p>Your words have virtue such as draws<br />
A faithful answer from the breast,<br />
Thro' light reproaches, half exprest,<br />
And loyal unto kindly laws.</p>
<p>My blood an even tenor kept,<br />
Till on mine ear this message falls,<br />
That in Vienna's fatal walls<br />
God's finger touch'd him, and he slept.</p>
<p>The great Intelligences fair<br />
That range above our mortal state,<br />
In circle round the blessed gate,<br />
Received and gave him welcome there;</p>
<p>And led him thro' the blissful climes,<br />
And show'd him in the fountain fresh<br />
All knowledge that the sons of flesh<br />
Shall gather in the cycled times.</p>
<p>But I remain'd, whose hopes were dim,<br />
Whose life, whose thoughts were little worth,<br />
To wander on a darken'd earth,<br />
Where all things round me breathed of him.'</p>
<p>O friendship, equal-poised control,<br />
O heart, with kindliest motion warm,<br />
O sacred essence, other form,<br />
O solemn ghost, O crowned soul!</p>
<p>Yet none could better know than I,<br />
How much of act at human hands<br />
The sense of human will demands<br />
By which we dare to live or die.</p>
<p>Whatever way my days decline,<br />
I felt and feel, tho' left alone,<br />
His being working in mine own,<br />
The footsteps of his life in mine;</p>
<p>A life that all the Muses deck'd<br />
With gifts of grace, that might express<br />
All-comprehensive tenderness,<br />
All-subtilising intellect:</p>
<p>And so my passion hath not swerved<br />
To works of weakness, but I find<br />
An image comforting the mind,<br />
And in my grief a strength reserved.</p>
<p>Likewise the imaginative woe,<br />
That loved to handle spiritual strife<br />
Diffused the shock thro' all my life,<br />
But in the present broke the blow.</p>
<p>My pulses therefore beat again<br />
For other friends that once I met;<br />
Nor can it suit me to forget<br />
The mighty hopes that make us men.</p>
<p>I woo your love: I count it crime<br />
To mourn for any overmuch;<br />
I, the divided half of such<br />
A friendship as had master'd Time;</p>
<p>Which masters Time indeed, and is<br />
Eternal, separate from fears:<br />
The all-assuming months and years<br />
Can take no part away from this:</p>
<p>But Summer on the steaming floods,<br />
And Spring that swells the narrow brooks,<br />
And Autumn, with a noise of rooks,<br />
That gather in the waning woods,</p>
<p>And every pulse of wind and wave<br />
Recalls, in change of light or gloom,<br />
My old affection of the tomb,<br />
And my prime passion in the grave:</p>
<p>My old affection of the tomb,<br />
A part of stillness, yearns to speak:<br />
‘Arise, and get thee forth and seek<br />
A friendship for the years to come.</p>
<p>'I watch thee from the quiet shore;<br />
Thy spirit up to mine can reach;<br />
But in dear words of human speech<br />
We two communicate no more.'</p>
<p>And I, ‘Can clouds of nature stain<br />
The starry clearness of the free?<br />
How is it? Canst thou feel for me<br />
Some painless sympathy with pain?'</p>
<p>And lightly does the whisper fall:<br />
'Tis hard for thee to fathom this;<br />
I triumph in conclusive bliss,<br />
And that serene result of all.'</p>
<p>So hold I commerce with the dead;<br />
Or so methinks the dead would say;<br />
Or so shall grief with symbols play<br />
And pining life be fancy-fed.</p>
<p>Now looking to some settled end,<br />
That these things pass, and I shall prove<br />
A meeting somewhere, love with love,<br />
I crave your pardon, O my friend;</p>
<p>If not so fresh, with love as true,<br />
I, clasping brother-hands, aver<br />
I could not, if I would, transfer<br />
The whole I felt for him to you.</p>
<p>For which be they that hold apart<br />
The promise of the golden hours?<br />
First love, first friendship, equal powers,<br />
That marry with the virgin heart.</p>
<p>Still mine, that cannot but deplore,<br />
That beats within a lonely place,<br />
That yet remembers his embrace,<br />
But at his footstep leaps no more,</p>
<p>My heart, tho' widow'd, may not rest<br />
Quite in the love of what is gone,<br />
But seeks to beat in time with one<br />
That warms another living breast.</p>
<p>Ah, take the imperfect gift I bring,<br />
Knowing the primrose yet is dear,<br />
The primrose of the later year,<br />
As not unlike to that of Spring.<br /></p>
<h2>LXXXVI</h2>
<p>Sweet after showers, ambrosial air,<br />
That rollest from the gorgeous gloom<br />
Of evening over brake and bloom<br />
And meadow, slowly breathing bare</p>
<p>The round of space, and rapt below<br />
Thro' all the dewy-tassell'd wood,<br />
And shadowing down the horned flood<br />
In ripples, fan my brows and blow</p>
<p>The fever from my cheek, and sigh<br />
The full new life that feeds thy breath<br />
Throughout my frame, till Doubt and Death,<br />
Ill brethren, let the fancy fly</p>
<p>From belt to belt of crimson seas<br />
On leagues of odour streaming far,<br />
To where in yonder orient star<br />
A hundred spirits whisper ‘Peace.'<br /></p>
<h2>LXXXVII</h2>
<p>I past beside the reverend walls<br />
In which of old I wore the gown;<br />
I roved at random thro' the town,<br />
And saw the tumult of the halls;</p>
<p>And heard once more in college fanes<br />
The storm their high-built organs make,<br />
And thunder-music, rolling, shake<br />
The prophet blazon'd on the panes;</p>
<p>And caught once more the distant shout,<br />
The measured pulse of racing oars<br />
Among the willows; paced the shores<br />
And many a bridge, and all about</p>
<p>The same gray flats again, and felt<br />
The same, but not the same; and last<br />
Up that long walk of limes I past<br />
To see the rooms in which he dwelt.</p>
<p>Another name was on the door:<br />
I linger'd; all within was noise<br />
Of songs, and clapping hands, and boys<br />
That crash'd the glass and beat the floor;</p>
<p>Where once we held debate, a band<br />
Of youthful friends, on mind and art,<br />
And labour, and the changing mart,<br />
And all the framework of the land;</p>
<p>When one would aim an arrow fair,<br />
But send it slackly from the string;<br />
And one would pierce an outer ring,<br />
And one an inner, here and there;</p>
<p>And last the master-bowman, he,<br />
Would cleave the mark. A willing ear<br />
We lent him. Who, but hung to hear<br />
The rapt oration flowing free</p>
<p>From point to point, with power and grace<br />
And music in the bounds of law,<br />
To those conclusions when we saw<br />
The God within him light his face,</p>
<p>And seem to lift the form, and glow<br />
In azure orbits heavenly-wise;<br />
And over those ethereal eyes<br />
The bar of Michael Angelo?<br /></p>
<h2>LXXXVIII</h2>
<p>Wild bird, whose warble, liquid sweet,<br />
Rings Eden thro' the budded quicks,<br />
O tell me where the senses mix,<br />
O tell me where the passions meet,</p>
<p>Whence radiate: fierce extremes employ<br />
Thy spirits in the darkening leaf,<br />
And in the midmost heart of grief<br />
Thy passion clasps a secret joy:</p>
<p>And I--my harp would prelude woe--<br />
I cannot all command the strings;<br />
The glory of the sum of things<br />
Will flash along the chords and go.<br /></p>
<h2>LXXXIX</h2>
<p>Witch-elms that counterchange the floor<br />
Of this flat lawn with dusk and bright;<br />
And thou, with all thy breadth and height<br />
Of foliage, towering sycamore;</p>
<p>How often, hither wandering down,<br />
My Arthur found your shadows fair,<br />
And shook to all the liberal air<br />
The dust and din and steam of town:</p>
<p>He brought an eye for all he saw;<br />
He mixt in all our simple sports;<br />
They pleased him, fresh from brawling courts<br />
And dusty purlieus of the law.</p>
<p>O joy to him in this retreat,<br />
Inmantled in ambrosial dark,<br />
To drink the cooler air, and mark<br />
The landscape winking thro' the heat:</p>
<p>O sound to rout the brood of cares,<br />
The sweep of scythe in morning dew,<br />
The gust that round the garden flew,<br />
And tumbled half the mellowing pears!</p>
<p>O bliss, when all in circle drawn<br />
About him, heart and ear were fed<br />
To hear him, as he lay and read<br />
The Tuscan poets on the lawn:</p>
<p>Or in the all-golden afternoon<br />
A guest, or happy sister, sung,<br />
Or here she brought the harp and flung<br />
A ballad to the brightening moon:</p>
<p>Nor less it pleased in livelier moods,<br />
Beyond the bounding hill to stray,<br />
And break the livelong summer day<br />
With banquet in the distant woods;</p>
<p>Whereat we glanced from theme to theme,<br />
Discuss'd the books to love or hate,<br />
Or touch'd the changes of the state,<br />
Or threaded some Socratic dream;</p>
<p>But if I praised the busy town,<br />
He loved to rail against it still,<br />
For ‘ground in yonder social mill<br />
We rub each other's angles down,</p>
<p>'And merge,' he said, ‘in form and gloss<br />
The picturesque of man and man.'<br />
We talk'd: the stream beneath us ran,<br />
The wine-flask lying couch'd in moss,</p>
<p>Or cool'd within the glooming wave;<br />
And last, returning from afar,<br />
Before the crimson-circled star<br />
Had fall'n into her father's grave,</p>
<p>And brushing ankle-deep in flowers,<br />
We heard behind the woodbine veil<br />
The milk that bubbled in the pail,<br />
And buzzings of the honied hours.<br /></p>
<h2>XC</h2>
<p>He tasted love with half his mind,<br />
Nor ever drank the inviolate spring<br />
Where nighest heaven, who first could fling<br />
This bitter seed among mankind;</p>
<p>That could the dead, whose dying eyes<br />
Were closed with wail, resume their life,<br />
They would but find in child and wife<br />
An iron welcome when they rise:</p>
<p>'Twas well, indeed, when warm with wine,<br />
To pledge them with a kindly tear,<br />
To talk them o'er, to wish them here,<br />
To count their memories half divine;</p>
<p>But if they came who past away,<br />
Behold their brides in other hands;<br />
The hard heir strides about their lands,<br />
And will not yield them for a day.</p>
<p>Yea, tho' their sons were none of these,<br />
Not less the yet-loved sire would make<br />
Confusion worse than death, and shake<br />
The pillars of domestic peace.</p>
<p>Ah dear, but come thou back to me:<br />
Whatever change the years have wrought,<br />
I find not yet one lonely thought<br />
That cries against my wish for thee.<br /></p>
<h2>XCI</h2>
<p>When rosy plumelets tuft the larch,<br />
And rarely pipes the mounted thrush;<br />
Or underneath the barren bush<br />
Flits by the sea-blue bird of March;</p>
<p>Come, wear the form by which I know<br />
Thy spirit in time among thy peers;<br />
The hope of unaccomplish'd years<br />
Be large and lucid round thy brow.</p>
<p>When summer's hourly-mellowing change<br />
May breathe, with many roses sweet,<br />
Upon the thousand waves of wheat,<br />
That ripple round the lonely grange;</p>
<p>Come: not in watches of the night,<br />
But where the sunbeam broodeth warm,<br />
Come, beauteous in thine after form,<br />
And like a finer light in light.<br /></p>
<h2>XCII</h2>
<p>If any vision should reveal<br />
Thy likeness, I might count it vain<br />
As but the canker of the brain;<br />
Yea, tho' it spake and made appeal</p>
<p>To chances where our lots were cast<br />
Together in the days behind,<br />
I might but say, I hear a wind<br />
Of memory murmuring the past.</p>
<p>Yea, tho' it spake and bared to view<br />
A fact within the coming year;<br />
And tho' the months, revolving near,<br />
Should prove the phantom-warning true,</p>
<p>They might not seem thy prophecies,<br />
But spiritual presentiments,<br />
And such refraction of events<br />
As often rises ere they rise.<br /></p>
<h2>XCIII</h2>
<p>I shall not see thee. Dare I say<br />
No spirit ever brake the band<br />
That stays him from the native land<br />
Where first he walk'd when claspt in clay?</p>
<p>No visual shade of some one lost,<br />
But he, the Spirit himself, may come<br />
Where all the nerve of sense is numb;<br />
Spirit to Spirit, Ghost to Ghost.</p>
<p>O, therefore from thy sightless range<br />
With gods in unconjectured bliss,<br />
O, from the distance of the abyss<br />
Of tenfold-complicated change,</p>
<p>Descend, and touch, and enter; hear<br />
The wish too strong for words to name;<br />
That in this blindness of the frame<br />
My Ghost may feel that thine is near.<br /></p>
<h2>XCIV</h2>
<p>How pure at heart and sound in head,<br />
With what divine affections bold<br />
Should be the man whose thought would hold<br />
An hour's communion with the dead.</p>
<p>In vain shalt thou, or any, call<br />
The spirits from their golden day,<br />
Except, like them, thou too canst say,<br />
My spirit is at peace with all.</p>
<p>They haunt the silence of the breast,<br />
Imaginations calm and fair,<br />
The memory like a cloudless air,<br />
The conscience as a sea at rest:</p>
<p>But when the heart is full of din,<br />
And doubt beside the portal waits,<br />
They can but listen at the gates<br />
And hear the household jar within.<br /></p>
<h2>XCV</h2>
<p>By night we linger'd on the lawn,<br />
For underfoot the herb was dry;<br />
And genial warmth; and o'er the sky<br />
The silvery haze of summer drawn;</p>
<p>And calm that let the tapers burn<br />
Unwavering: not a cricket chirr'd:<br />
The brook alone far-off was heard,<br />
And on the board the fluttering urn:</p>
<p>And bats went round in fragrant skies,<br />
And wheel'd or lit the filmy shapes<br />
That haunt the dusk, with ermine capes<br />
And woolly breasts and beaded eyes;</p>
<p>While now we sang old songs that peal'd<br />
From knoll to knoll, where, couch'd at ease,<br />
The white kine glimmer'd, and the trees<br />
Laid their dark arms about the field.</p>
<p>But when those others, one by one,<br />
Withdrew themselves from me and night,<br />
And in the house light after light<br />
Went out, and I was all alone,</p>
<p>A hunger seized my heart; I read<br />
Of that glad year which once had been,<br />
In those fall'n leaves which kept their green,<br />
The noble letters of the dead:</p>
<p>And strangely on the silence broke<br />
The silent-speaking words, and strange<br />
Was love's dumb cry defying change<br />
To test his worth; and strangely spoke</p>
<p>The faith, the vigour, bold to dwell<br />
On doubts that drive the coward back,<br />
And keen thro' wordy snares to track<br />
Suggestion to her inmost cell.</p>
<p>So word by word, and line by line,<br />
The dead man touch'd me from the past,<br />
And all at once it seem'd at last<br />
The living soul was flash'd on mine,</p>
<p>And mine in his was wound, and whirl'd<br />
About empyreal heights of thought,<br />
And came on that which is, and caught<br />
The deep pulsations of the world,</p>
<p>Ćonian music measuring out<br />
The steps of Time--the shocks of Chance--<br />
The blows of Death. At length my trance<br />
Was cancell'd, stricken thro' with doubt.</p>
<p>Vague words! but ah, how hard to frame<br />
In matter-moulded forms of speech,<br />
Or ev'n for intellect to reach<br />
Thro' memory that which I became:</p>
<p>Till now the doubtful dusk reveal'd<br />
The knolls once more where, couch'd at ease,<br />
The white kine glimmer'd, and the trees<br />
Laid their dark arms about the field;</p>
<p>And suck'd from out the distant gloom<br />
A breeze began to tremble o'er<br />
The large leaves of the sycamore,<br />
And fluctuate all the still perfume,</p>
<p>And gathering freshlier overhead,<br />
Rock'd the full-foliaged elms, and swung<br />
The heavy-folded rose, and flung<br />
The lilies to and fro, and said,</p>
<p>'The dawn, the dawn,' and died away;<br />
And East and West, without a breath,<br />
Mixt their dim lights, like life and death,<br />
To broaden into boundless day.<br /></p>
<h2>XCVI</h2>
<p>You say, but with no touch of scorn,<br />
Sweet-hearted, you, whose light-blue eyes<br />
Are tender over drowning flies,<br />
You tell me, doubt is Devil-born.</p>
<p>I know not: one indeed I knew<br />
In many a subtle question versed,<br />
Who touch'd a jarring lyre at first,<br />
But ever strove to make it true:</p>
<p>Perplext in faith, but pure in deeds,<br />
At last he beat his music out.<br />
There lives more faith in honest doubt,<br />
Believe me, than in half the creeds.</p>
<p>He fought his doubts and gather'd strength,<br />
He would not make his judgment blind,<br />
He faced the spectres of the mind<br />
And laid them: thus he came at length</p>
<p>To find a stronger faith his own;<br />
And Power was with him in the night,<br />
Which makes the darkness and the light,<br />
And dwells not in the light alone,</p>
<p>But in the darkness and the cloud,<br />
As over Sinai's peaks of old,<br />
While Israel made their gods of gold,<br />
Altho' the trumpet blew so loud.<br /></p>
<h2>XCVII</h2>
<p>My love has talk'd with rocks and trees;<br />
He finds on misty mountain-ground<br />
His own vast shadow glory-crown'd;<br />
He sees himself in all he sees.</p>
<p>Two partners of a married life--<br />
I look'd on these and thought of thee<br />
In vastness and in mystery,<br />
And of my spirit as of a wife.</p>
<p>These two--they dwelt with eye on eye,<br />
Their hearts of old have beat in tune,<br />
Their meetings made December June<br />
Their every parting was to die.</p>
<p>Their love has never past away;<br />
The days she never can forget<br />
Are earnest that he loves her yet,<br />
Whate'er the faithless people say.</p>
<p>Her life is lone, he sits apart,<br />
He loves her yet, she will not weep,<br />
Tho' rapt in matters dark and deep<br />
He seems to slight her simple heart.</p>
<p>He thrids the labyrinth of the mind,<br />
He reads the secret of the star,<br />
He seems so near and yet so far,<br />
He looks so cold: she thinks him kind.</p>
<p>She keeps the gift of years before<br />
A wither'd violet is her bliss<br />
She knows not what his greatness is,<br />
For that, for all, she loves him more.</p>
<p>For him she plays, to him she sings<br />
Of early faith and plighted vows;<br />
She knows but matters of the house,<br />
And he, he knows a thousand things.</p>
<p>Her faith is fixt and cannot move,<br />
She darkly feels him great and wise,<br />
She dwells on him with faithful eyes,<br />
'I cannot understand: I love.'<br /></p>
<h2>XCVIII</h2>
<p>You leave us: you will see the Rhine,<br />
And those fair hills I sail'd below,<br />
When I was there with him; and go<br />
By summer belts of wheat and vine</p>
<p>To where he breathed his latest breath,<br />
That City. All her splendour seems<br />
No livelier than the wisp that gleams<br />
On Lethe in the eyes of Death.</p>
<p>Let her great Danube rolling fair<br />
Enwind her isles, unmark'd of me:<br />
I have not seen, I will not see<br />
Vienna; rather dream that there,</p>
<p>A treble darkness, Evil haunts<br />
The birth, the bridal; friend from friend<br />
Is oftener parted, fathers bend<br />
Above more graves, a thousand wants</p>
<p>Gnarr at the heels of men, and prey<br />
By each cold hearth, and sadness flings<br />
Her shadow on the blaze of kings:<br />
And yet myself have heard him say,</p>
<p>That not in any mother town<br />
With statelier progress to and fro<br />
The double tides of chariots flow<br />
By park and suburb under brown</p>
<p>Of lustier leaves; nor more content,<br />
He told me, lives in any crowd,<br />
When all is gay with lamps, and loud<br />
With sport and song, in booth and tent,</p>
<p>Imperial halls, or open plain;<br />
And wheels the circled dance, and breaks<br />
The rocket molten into flakes<br />
Of crimson or in emerald rain.<br /></p>
<h2>XCIX</h2>
<p>Risest thou thus, dim dawn, again,<br />
So loud with voices of the birds,<br />
So thick with lowings of the herds,<br />
Day, when I lost the flower of men;</p>
<p>Who tremblest thro' thy darkling red<br />
On yon swoll'n brook that bubbles fast<br />
By meadows breathing of the past,<br />
And woodlands holy to the dead;</p>
<p>Who murmurest in the foliaged eaves<br />
A song that slights the coming care,<br />
And Autumn laying here and there<br />
A fiery finger on the leaves;</p>
<p>Who wakenest with thy balmy breath<br />
To myriads on the genial earth,<br />
Memories of bridal, or of birth,<br />
And unto myriads more, of death.</p>
<p>O, wheresoever those may be,<br />
Betwixt the slumber of the poles,<br />
To-day they count as kindred souls;<br />
They know me not, but mourn with me.<br /></p>
<h2>C</h2>
<p>I climb the hill: from end to end<br />
Of all the landscape underneath,<br />
I find no place that does not breathe<br />
Some gracious memory of my friend;</p>
<p>No gray old grange, or lonely fold,<br />
Or low morass and whispering reed,<br />
Or simple stile from mead to mead,<br />
Or sheepwalk up the windy wold;</p>
<p>Nor hoary knoll of ash and haw<br />
That hears the latest linnet trill,<br />
Nor quarry trench'd along the hill<br />
And haunted by the wrangling daw;</p>
<p>Nor runlet tinkling from the rock;<br />
Nor pastoral rivulet that swerves<br />
To left and right thro' meadowy curves,<br />
That feed the mothers of the flock;</p>
<p>But each has pleased a kindred eye,<br />
And each reflects a kindlier day;<br />
And, leaving these, to pass away,<br />
I think once more he seems to die.<br /></p>
<h2>CI</h2>
<p>Unwatch'd, the garden bough shall sway,<br />
The tender blossom flutter down,<br />
Unloved, that beech will gather brown,<br />
This maple burn itself away;</p>
<p>Unloved, the sun-flower, shining fair,<br />
Ray round with flames her disk of seed,<br />
And many a rose-carnation feed<br />
With summer spice the humming air;</p>
<p>Unloved, by many a sandy bar,<br />
The brook shall babble down the plain,<br />
At noon or when the lesser wain<br />
Is twisting round the polar star;</p>
<p>Uncared for, gird the windy grove,<br />
And flood the haunts of hern and crake;<br />
Or into silver arrows break<br />
The sailing moon in creek and cove;</p>
<p>Till from the garden and the wild<br />
A fresh association blow,<br />
And year by year the landscape grow<br />
Familiar to the stranger's child;</p>
<p>As year by year the labourer tills<br />
His wonted glebe, or lops the glades;<br />
And year by year our memory fades<br />
From all the circle of the hills.<br /></p>
<h2>CII</h2>
<p>We leave the well-beloved place<br />
Where first we gazed upon the sky;<br />
The roofs, that heard our earliest cry,<br />
Will shelter one of stranger race.</p>
<p>We go, but ere we go from home,<br />
As down the garden-walks I move,<br />
Two spirits of a diverse love<br />
Contend for loving masterdom.</p>
<p>One whispers, ‘Here thy boyhood sung<br />
Long since its matin song, and heard<br />
The low love-language of the bird<br />
In native hazels tassel-hung.'</p>
<p>The other answers, ‘Yea, but here<br />
Thy feet have stray'd in after hours<br />
With thy lost friend among the bowers,<br />
And this hath made them trebly dear.'</p>
<p>These two have striven half the day,<br />
And each prefers his separate claim,<br />
Poor rivals in a losing game,<br />
That will not yield each other way.</p>
<p>I turn to go: my feet are set<br />
To leave the pleasant fields and farms;<br />
They mix in one another's arms<br />
To one pure image of regret.<br /></p>
<h2>CIII</h2>
<p>On that last night before we went<br />
From out the doors where I was bred,<br />
I dream'd a vision of the dead,<br />
Which left my after-morn content.</p>
<p>Methought I dwelt within a hall,<br />
And maidens with me: distant hills<br />
From hidden summits fed with rills<br />
A river sliding by the wall.</p>
<p>The hall with harp and carol rang.<br />
They sang of what is wise and good<br />
And graceful. In the centre stood<br />
A statue veil'd, to which they sang;</p>
<p>And which, tho' veil'd, was known to me,<br />
The shape of him I loved, and love<br />
For ever: then flew in a dove<br />
And brought a summons from the sea:</p>
<p>And when they learnt that I must go<br />
They wept and wail'd, but led the way<br />
To where a little shallop lay<br />
At anchor in the flood below;</p>
<p>And on by many a level mead,<br />
And shadowing bluff that made the banks,<br />
We glided winding under ranks<br />
Of iris, and the golden reed;</p>
<p>And still as vaster grew the shore<br />
And roll'd the floods in grander space,<br />
The maidens gather'd strength and grace<br />
And presence, lordlier than before;</p>
<p>And I myself, who sat apart<br />
And watch'd them, wax'd in every limb;<br />
I felt the thews of Anakim,<br />
The pulses of a Titan's heart;</p>
<p>As one would sing the death of war,<br />
And one would chant the history<br />
Of that great race, which is to be,<br />
And one the shaping of a star;</p>
<p>Until the forward-creeping tides<br />
Began to foam, and we to draw<br />
From deep to deep, to where we saw<br />
A great ship lift her shining sides.</p>
<p>The man we loved was there on deck,<br />
But thrice as large as man he bent<br />
To greet us. Up the side I went,<br />
And fell in silence on his neck;</p>
<p>Whereat those maidens with one mind<br />
Bewail'd their lot; I did them wrong:<br />
‘We served thee here,' they said, ‘so long,<br />
And wilt thou leave us now behind?'</p>
<p>So rapt I was, they could not win<br />
An answer from my lips, but he<br />
Replying, ‘Enter likewise ye<br />
And go with us:' they enter'd in.</p>
<p>And while the wind began to sweep<br />
A music out of sheet and shroud,<br />
We steer'd her toward a crimson cloud<br />
That landlike slept along the deep.<br /></p>
<h2>CIV</h2>
<p>The time draws near the birth of Christ;<br />
The moon is hid, the night is still;<br />
A single church below the hill<br />
Is pealing, folded in the mist.</p>
<p>A single peal of bells below,<br />
That wakens at this hour of rest<br />
A single murmur in the breast,<br />
That these are not the bells I know.</p>
<p>Like strangers' voices here they sound,<br />
In lands where not a memory strays,<br />
Nor landmark breathes of other days,<br />
But all is new unhallow'd ground.<br /></p>
<h2>CV</h2>
<p>To-night ungather'd let us leave<br />
This laurel, let this holly stand:<br />
We live within the stranger's land,<br />
And strangely falls our Christmas-eve.</p>
<p>Our father's dust is left alone<br />
And silent under other snows:<br />
There in due time the woodbine blows,<br />
The violet comes, but we are gone.</p>
<p>No more shall wayward grief abuse<br />
The genial hour with mask and mime,<br />
For change of place, like growth of time,<br />
Has broke the bond of dying use.</p>
<p>Let cares that petty shadows cast,<br />
By which our lives are chiefly proved,<br />
A little spare the night I loved,<br />
And hold it solemn to the past.</p>
<p>But let no footstep beat the floor,<br />
Nor bowl of wassail mantle warm;<br />
For who would keep an ancient form<br />
Thro' which the spirit breathes no more?</p>
<p>Be neither song, nor game, nor feast;<br />
Nor harp be touch'd, nor flute be blown;<br />
No dance, no motion, save alone<br />
What lightens in the lucid east</p>
<p>Of rising worlds by yonder wood.<br />
Long sleeps the summer in the seed;<br />
Run out your measured arcs, and lead<br />
The closing cycle rich in good.<br /></p>
<h2>CVI</h2>
<p>Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,<br />
The flying cloud, the frosty light:<br />
The year is dying in the night;<br />
Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.</p>
<p>Ring out the old, ring in the new,<br />
Ring, happy bells, across the snow:<br />
The year is going, let him go;<br />
Ring out the false, ring in the true.</p>
<p>Ring out the grief that saps the mind,<br />
For those that here we see no more;<br />
Ring out the feud of rich and poor,<br />
Ring in redress to all mankind.</p>
<p>Ring out a slowly dying cause,<br />
And ancient forms of party strife;<br />
Ring in the nobler modes of life,<br />
With sweeter manners, purer laws.</p>
<p>Ring out the want, the care, the sin,<br />
The faithless coldness of the times;<br />
Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,<br />
But ring the fuller minstrel in.</p>
<p>Ring out false pride in place and blood,<br />
The civic slander and the spite;<br />
Ring in the love of truth and right,<br />
Ring in the common love of good.</p>
<p>Ring out old shapes of foul disease;<br />
Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;<br />
Ring out the thousand wars of old,<br />
Ring in the thousand years of peace.</p>
<p>Ring in the valiant man and free,<br />
The larger heart, the kindlier hand;<br />
Ring out the darkness of the land,<br />
Ring in the Christ that is to be.<br /></p>
<h2>CVII</h2>
<p>It is the day when he was born,<br />
A bitter day that early sank<br />
Behind a purple-frosty bank<br />
Of vapour, leaving night forlorn.</p>
<p>The time admits not flowers or leaves<br />
To deck the banquet. Fiercely flies<br />
The blast of North and East, and ice<br />
Makes daggers at the sharpen'd eaves,</p>
<p>And bristles all the brakes and thorns<br />
To yon hard crescent, as she hangs<br />
Above the wood which grides and clangs<br />
Its leafless ribs and iron horns</p>
<p>Together, in the drifts that pass<br />
To darken on the rolling brine<br />
That breaks the coast. But fetch the wine,<br />
Arrange the board and brim the glass;</p>
<p>Bring in great logs and let them lie,<br />
To make a solid core of heat;<br />
Be cheerful-minded, talk and treat<br />
Of all things ev'n as he were by;</p>
<p>We keep the day. With festal cheer,<br />
With books and music, surely we<br />
Will drink to him, whate'er he be,<br />
And sing the songs he loved to hear.<br /></p>
<h2>CVIII</h2>
<p>I will not shut me from my kind,<br />
And, lest I stiffen into stone,<br />
I will not eat my heart alone,<br />
Nor feed with sighs a passing wind:</p>
<p>What profit lies in barren faith,<br />
And vacant yearning, tho' with might<br />
To scale the heaven's highest height,<br />
Or dive below the wells of Death?</p>
<p>What find I in the highest place,<br />
But mine own phantom chanting hymns?<br />
And on the depths of death there swims<br />
The reflex of a human face.</p>
<p>I'll rather take what fruit may be<br />
Of sorrow under human skies:<br />
'Tis held that sorrow makes us wise,<br />
Whatever wisdom sleep with thee.<br /></p>
<h2>CIX</h2>
<p>Heart-affluence in discursive talk<br />
From household fountains never dry;<br />
The critic clearness of an eye,<br />
That saw thro' all the Muses' walk;</p>
<p>Seraphic intellect and force<br />
To seize and throw the doubts of man;<br />
Impassion'd logic, which outran<br />
The hearer in its fiery course;</p>
<p>High nature amorous of the good,<br />
But touch'd with no ascetic gloom;<br />
And passion pure in snowy bloom<br />
Thro' all the years of April blood;</p>
<p>A love of freedom rarely felt,<br />
Of freedom in her regal seat<br />
Of England; not the schoolboy heat,<br />
The blind hysterics of the Celt;</p>
<p>And manhood fused with female grace<br />
In such a sort, the child would twine<br />
A trustful hand, unask'd, in thine,<br />
And find his comfort in thy face;</p>
<p>All these have been, and thee mine eyes<br />
Have look'd on: if they look'd in vain,<br />
My shame is greater who remain,<br />
Nor let thy wisdom make me wise.<br /></p>
<h2>CX</h2>
<p>Thy converse drew us with delight,<br />
The men of rathe and riper years:<br />
The feeble soul, a haunt of fears,<br />
Forgot his weakness in thy sight.</p>
<p>On thee the loyal-hearted hung,<br />
The proud was half disarm'd of pride,<br />
Nor cared the serpent at thy side<br />
To flicker with his double tongue.</p>
<p>The stern were mild when thou wert by,<br />
The flippant put himself to school<br />
And heard thee, and the brazen fool<br />
Was soften'd, and he knew not why;</p>
<p>While I, thy nearest, sat apart,<br />
And felt thy triumph was as mine;<br />
And loved them more, that they were thine,<br />
The graceful tact, the Christian art;</p>
<p>Nor mine the sweetness or the skill,<br />
But mine the love that will not tire,<br />
And, born of love, the vague desire<br />
That spurs an imitative will.<br /></p>
<h2>CXI</h2>
<p>The churl in spirit, up or down<br />
Along the scale of ranks, thro' all,<br />
To him who grasps a golden ball,<br />
By blood a king, at heart a clown;</p>
<p>The churl in spirit, howe'er he veil<br />
His want in forms for fashion's sake,<br />
Will let his coltish nature break<br />
At seasons thro' the gilded pale:</p>
<p>For who can always act? but he,<br />
To whom a thousand memories call,<br />
Not being less but more than all<br />
The gentleness he seem'd to be,</p>
<p>Best seem'd the thing he was, and join'd<br />
Each office of the social hour<br />
To noble manners, as the flower<br />
And native growth of noble mind;</p>
<p>Nor ever narrowness or spite,<br />
Or villain fancy fleeting by,<br />
Drew in the expression of an eye,<br />
Where God and Nature met in light;</p>
<p>And thus he bore without abuse<br />
The grand old name of gentleman,<br />
Defamed by every charlatan,<br />
And soil'd with all ignoble use.<br /></p>
<h2>CXII</h2>
<p>High wisdom holds my wisdom less,<br />
That I, who gaze with temperate eyes<br />
On glorious insufficiencies,<br />
Set light by narrower perfectness.</p>
<p>But thou, that fillest all the room<br />
Of all my love, art reason why<br />
I seem to cast a careless eye<br />
On souls, the lesser lords of doom.</p>
<p>For what wert thou? some novel power<br />
Sprang up for ever at a touch,<br />
And hope could never hope too much,<br />
In watching thee from hour to hour,</p>
<p>Large elements in order brought,<br />
And tracts of calm from tempest made,<br />
And world-wide fluctuation sway'd<br />
In vassal tides that follow'd thought.<br /></p>
<h2>CXIII</h2>
<p>'Tis held that sorrow makes us wise;<br />
Yet how much wisdom sleeps with thee<br />
Which not alone had guided me,<br />
But served the seasons that may rise;</p>
<p>For can I doubt, who knew thee keen<br />
In intellect, with force and skill<br />
To strive, to fashion, to fulfil--<br />
I doubt not what thou wouldst have been:</p>
<p>A life in civic action warm,<br />
A soul on highest mission sent,<br />
A potent voice of Parliament,<br />
A pillar steadfast in the storm,</p>
<p>Should licensed boldness gather force,<br />
Becoming, when the time has birth,<br />
A lever to uplift the earth<br />
And roll it in another course,</p>
<p>With thousand shocks that come and go,<br />
With agonies, with energies,<br />
With overthrowings, and with cries<br />
And undulations to and fro.<br /></p>
<h2>CXIV</h2>
<p>Who loves not Knowledge? Who shall rail<br />
Against her beauty? May she mix<br />
With men and prosper! Who shall fix<br />
Her pillars? Let her work prevail.</p>
<p>But on her forehead sits a fire:<br />
She sets her forward countenance<br />
And leaps into the future chance,<br />
Submitting all things to desire.</p>
<p>Half-grown as yet, a child, and vain?<br />
She cannot fight the fear of death.<br />
What is she, cut from love and faith,<br />
But some wild Pallas from the brain</p>
<p>Of Demons? fiery-hot to burst<br />
All barriers in her onward race<br />
For power. Let her know her place;<br />
She is the second, not the first.</p>
<p>A higher hand must make her mild,<br />
If all be not in vain; and guide<br />
Her footsteps, moving side by side<br />
With wisdom, like the younger child:</p>
<p>For she is earthly of the mind,<br />
But Wisdom heavenly of the soul.<br />
O, friend, who camest to thy goal<br />
So early, leaving me behind,</p>
<p>I would the great world grew like thee,<br />
Who grewest not alone in power<br />
And knowledge, but by year and hour<br />
In reverence and in charity.<br /></p>
<h2>CXV</h2>
<p>Now fades the last long streak of snow,<br />
Now burgeons every maze of quick<br />
About the flowering squares, and thick<br />
By ashen roots the violets blow.</p>
<p>Now rings the woodland loud and long,<br />
The distance takes a lovelier hue,<br />
And drown'd in yonder living blue<br />
The lark becomes a sightless song.</p>
<p>Now dance the lights on lawn and lea,<br />
The flocks are whiter down the vale,<br />
And milkier every milky sail<br />
On winding stream or distant sea;</p>
<p>Where now the seamew pipes, or dives<br />
In yonder greening gleam, and fly<br />
The happy birds, that change their sky<br />
To build and brood; that live their lives</p>
<p>From land to land; and in my breast<br />
Spring wakens too; and my regret<br />
Becomes an April violet,<br />
And buds and blossoms like the rest.<br /></p>
<h2>CXVI</h2>
<p>Is it, then, regret for buried time<br />
That keenlier in sweet April wakes,<br />
And meets the year, and gives and takes<br />
The colours of the crescent prime?</p>
<p>Not all: the songs, the stirring air,<br />
The life re-orient out of dust<br />
Cry thro' the sense to hearten trust<br />
In that which made the world so fair.</p>
<p>Not all regret: the face will shine<br />
Upon me, while I muse alone;<br />
And that dear voice, I once have known,<br />
Still speak to me of me and mine:</p>
<p>Yet less of sorrow lives in me<br />
For days of happy commune dead;<br />
Less yearning for the friendship fled,<br />
Than some strong bond which is to be.<br /></p>
<h2>CXVII</h2>
<p>O days and hours, your work is this<br />
To hold me from my proper place,<br />
A little while from his embrace,<br />
For fuller gain of after bliss:</p>
<p>That out of distance might ensue<br />
Desire of nearness doubly sweet;<br />
And unto meeting when we meet,<br />
Delight a hundredfold accrue,</p>
<p>For every grain of sand that runs,<br />
And every span of shade that steals,<br />
And every kiss of toothed wheels,<br />
And all the courses of the suns.<br /></p>
<h2>CXVIII</h2>
<p>Contemplate all this work of Time,<br />
The giant labouring in his youth;<br />
Nor dream of human love and truth,<br />
As dying Nature's earth and lime;</p>
<p>But trust that those we call the dead<br />
Are breathers of an ampler day<br />
For ever nobler ends. They say,<br />
The solid earth whereon we tread</p>
<p>In tracts of fluent heat began,<br />
And grew to seeming-random forms,<br />
The seeming prey of cyclic storms,<br />
Till at the last arose the man;</p>
<p>Who throve and branch'd from clime to clime,<br />
The herald of a higher race,<br />
And of himself in higher place,<br />
If so he type this work of time</p>
<p>Within himself, from more to more;<br />
Or, crown'd with attributes of woe<br />
Like glories, move his course, and show<br />
That life is not as idle ore,</p>
<p>But iron dug from central gloom,<br />
And heated hot with burning fears,<br />
And dipt in baths of hissing tears,<br />
And batter'd with the shocks of doom</p>
<p>To shape and use. Arise and fly<br />
The reeling Faun, the sensual feast;<br />
Move upward, working out the beast,<br />
And let the ape and tiger die.<br /></p>
<h2>CXIX</h2>
<p>Doors, where my heart was used to beat<br />
So quickly, not as one that weeps<br />
I come once more; the city sleeps;<br />
I smell the meadow in the street;</p>
<p>I hear a chirp of birds; I see<br />
Betwixt the black fronts long-withdrawn<br />
A light-blue lane of early dawn,<br />
And think of early days and thee,</p>
<p>And bless thee, for thy lips are bland,<br />
And bright the friendship of thine eye;<br />
And in my thoughts with scarce a sigh<br />
I take the pressure of thine hand.<br /></p>
<h2>CXX</h2>
<p>I trust I have not wasted breath:<br />
I think we are not wholly brain,<br />
Magnetic mockeries; not in vain,<br />
Like Paul with beasts, I fought with Death;</p>
<p>Not only cunning casts in clay:<br />
Let Science prove we are, and then<br />
What matters Science unto men,<br />
At least to me? I would not stay.</p>
<p>Let him, the wiser man who springs<br />
Hereafter, up from childhood shape<br />
His action like the greater ape,<br />
But I was born to other things.<br /></p>
<h2>CXXI</h2>
<p>Sad Hesper o'er the buried sun<br />
And ready, thou, to die with him,<br />
Thou watchest all things ever dim<br />
And dimmer, and a glory done.</p>
<p>The team is loosen'd from the wain,<br />
The boat is drawn upon the shore;<br />
Thou listenest to the closing door,<br />
And life is darken'd in the brain.</p>
<p>Bright Phosphor, fresher for the night,<br />
By thee the world's great work is heard<br />
Beginning, and the wakeful bird;<br />
Behind thee comes the greater light.</p>
<p>The market boat is on the stream,<br />
And voices hail it from the brink;<br />
Thou hear'st the village hammer clink,<br />
And see'st the moving of the team.</p>
<p>Sweet Hesper-Phosphor, double name<br />
For what is one, the first, the last,<br />
Thou, like my present and my past,<br />
Thy place is changed; thou art the same.<br /></p>
<h2>CXXII</h2>
<p>Oh, wast thou with me, dearest, then,<br />
While I rose up against my doom,<br />
And yearn'd to burst the folded gloom,<br />
To bare the eternal Heavens again,</p>
<p>To feel once more, in placid awe,<br />
The strong imagination roll<br />
A sphere of stars about my soul,<br />
In all her motion one with law?</p>
<p>If thou wert with me, and the grave<br />
Divide us not, be with me now,<br />
And enter in at breast and brow,<br />
Till all my blood, a fuller wave,</p>
<p>Be quicken'd with a livelier breath,<br />
And like an inconsiderate boy,<br />
As in the former flash of joy,<br />
I slip the thoughts of life and death;</p>
<p><span id="breeze_of_Fancy"></span>And all the breeze of Fancy blows,<br />
And every dew-drop paints a bow,<br />
The wizard lightnings deeply glow,<br />
And every thought breaks out a rose.<br /></p>
<h2>CXXIII</h2>
<p>There rolls the deep where grew the tree.<br />
O earth, what changes hast thou seen!<br />
There where the long street roars, hath been<br />
The stillness of the central sea.</p>
<p>The hills are shadows, and they flow<br />
From form to form, and nothing stands;<br />
They melt like mist, the solid lands,<br />
Like clouds they shape themselves and go.</p>
<p>But in my spirit will I dwell,<br />
And dream my dream, and hold it true;<br />
For tho' my lips may breathe adieu,<br />
I cannot think the thing farewell.<br /></p>
<h2>CXXIV</h2>
<p>That which we dare invoke to bless;<br />
Our dearest faith; our ghastliest doubt;<br />
He, They, One, All; within, without;<br />
The Power in darkness whom we guess,--</p>
<p>I found Him not in world or sun,<br />
Or eagle's wing, or insect's eye,<br />
Nor thro' the questions men may try,<br />
The petty cobwebs we have spun.</p>
<p>If e'er when faith had fall'n asleep,<br />
I heard a voice ‘believe no more,'<br />
And heard an ever-breaking shore<br />
That tumbled in the Godless deep,</p>
<p>A warmth within the breast would melt<br />
The freezing reason's colder part,<br />
And like a man in wrath the heart<br />
Stood up and answer'd ‘I have felt.'</p>
<p>No, like a child in doubt and fear:<br />
But that blind clamour made me wise;<br />
Then was I as a child that cries,<br />
But, crying, knows his father near;</p>
<p>And what I am beheld again<br />
What is, and no man understands;<br />
And out of darkness came the hands<br />
That reach thro' nature, moulding men.<br /></p>
<h2>CXXV</h2>
<p>Whatever I have said or sung,<br />
Some bitter notes my harp would give,<br />
Yea, tho' there often seem'd to live<br />
A contradiction on the tongue,</p>
<p>Yet Hope had never lost her youth,<br />
She did but look through dimmer eyes;<br />
Or Love but play'd with gracious lies,<br />
Because he felt so fix'd in truth;</p>
<p>And if the song were full of care,<br />
He breathed the spirit of the song;<br />
And if the words were sweet and strong<br />
He set his royal signet there;</p>
<p>Abiding with me till I sail<br />
To seek thee on the mystic deeps,<br />
And this electric force, that keeps<br />
A thousand pulses dancing, fail.<br /></p>
<h2>CXXVI</h2>
<p>Love is and was my Lord and King,<br />
And in his presence I attend<br />
To hear the tidings of my friend,<br />
Which every hour his couriers bring.</p>
<p>Love is and was my King and Lord,<br />
And will be, tho' as yet I keep<br />
Within his court on earth, and sleep<br />
Encompass'd by his faithful guard,</p>
<p>And hear at times a sentinel<br />
Who moves about from place to place,<br />
And whispers to the worlds of space,<br />
In the deep night, that all is well.<br /></p>
<h2>CXXVII</h2>
<p>And all is well, tho' faith and form<br />
Be sunder'd in the night of fear;<br />
Well roars the storm to those that hear<br />
A deeper voice across the storm,</p>
<p>Proclaiming social truth shall spread,<br />
And justice, ev'n tho' thrice again<br />
The red fool-fury of the Seine<br />
Should pile her barricades with dead.</p>
<p>But ill for him that wears a crown,<br />
And him, the lazar, in his rags:<br />
They tremble, the sustaining crags;<br />
The spires of ice are toppled down,</p>
<p>And molten up, and roar in flood;<br />
The fortress crashes from on high,<br />
The brute earth lightens to the sky,<br />
And the great Æon sinks in blood,</p>
<p>And compass'd by the fires of Hell;<br />
While thou, dear spirit, happy star,<br />
O'erlook'st the tumult from afar,<br />
And smilest, knowing all is well.<br /></p>
<h2>CXXVIII</h2>
<p>The love that rose on stronger wings,<br />
Unpalsied when he met with Death,<br />
Is comrade of the lesser faith<br />
That sees the course of human things.</p>
<p>No doubt vast eddies in the flood<br />
Of onward time shall yet be made,<br />
And throned races may degrade;<br />
Yet, O ye mysteries of good,</p>
<p>Wild Hours that fly with Hope and Fear,<br />
If all your office had to do<br />
With old results that look like new;<br />
If this were all your mission here,</p>
<p>To draw, to sheathe a useless sword,<br />
To fool the crowd with glorious lies,<br />
To cleave a creed in sects and cries,<br />
To change the bearing of a word,</p>
<p>To shift an arbitrary power,<br />
To cramp the student at his desk,<br />
To make old bareness picturesque<br />
And tuft with grass a feudal tower;</p>
<p>Why then my scorn might well descend<br />
On you and yours. I see in part<br />
That all, as in some piece of art,<br />
Is toil cöoperant to an end.<br /></p>
<h2>CXXIX</h2>
<p>Dear friend, far off, my lost desire,<br />
So far, so near in woe and weal,<br />
O loved the most, when most I feel<br />
There is a lower and a higher;</p>
<p>Known and unknown, human, divine;<br />
Sweet human hand and lips and eye;<br />
Dear heavenly friend that canst not die,<br />
Mine, mine, for ever, ever mine;</p>
<p>Strange friend, past, present, and to be;<br />
Loved deeplier, darklier understood;<br />
Behold, I dream a dream of good,<br />
And mingle all the world with thee.<br /></p>
<h2>CXXX</h2>
<p>Thy voice is on the rolling air;<br />
I hear thee where the waters run;<br />
Thou standest in the rising sun,<br />
And in the setting thou art fair.</p>
<p>What art thou then? I cannot guess;<br />
But tho' I seem in star and flower<br />
To feel thee some diffusive power,<br />
I do not therefore love thee less.</p>
<p>My love involves the love before;<br />
My love is vaster passion now;<br />
Tho' mix'd with God and Nature thou,<br />
I seem to love thee more and more.</p>
<p>Far off thou art, but ever nigh;<br />
I have thee still, and I rejoice;<br />
I prosper, circled with thy voice;<br />
I shall not lose thee tho' I die.<br /></p>
<h2>CXXXI</h2>
<p>O living will that shalt endure<br />
When all that seems shall suffer shock,<br />
Rise in the spiritual rock,<br />
Flow thro' our deeds and make them pure,</p>
<p>That we may lift from out of dust<br />
A voice as unto him that hears,<br />
A cry above the conquer'd years<br />
To one that with us works, and trust,</p>
<p>With faith that comes of self-control,<br />
The truths that never can be proved<br />
Until we close with all we loved,<br />
And all we flow from, soul in soul.<br /></p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>O true and tried, so well and long,<br />
Demand not thou a marriage lay;<br />
In that it is thy marriage day<br />
Is music more than any song.</p>
<p>Nor have I felt so much of bliss<br />
Since first he told me that he loved<br />
A daughter of our house, nor proved<br />
Since that dark day a day like this;</p>
<p>Tho' I since then have number'd o'er<br />
Some thrice three years: they went and came,<br />
Remade the blood and changed the frame,<br />
And yet is love not less, but more;</p>
<p>No longer caring to embalm<br />
In dying songs a dead regret,<br />
But like a statue solid-set,<br />
And moulded in colossal calm.</p>
<p>Regret is dead, but love is more<br />
Than in the summers that are flown,<br />
For I myself with these have grown<br />
To something greater than before;</p>
<p>Which makes appear the songs I made<br />
As echoes out of weaker times,<br />
As half but idle brawling rhymes,<br />
The sport of random sun and shade.</p>
<p>But where is she, the bridal flower,<br />
That must be made a wife ere noon?<br />
She enters, glowing like the moon<br />
Of Eden on its bridal bower:</p>
<p>On me she bends her blissful eyes<br />
And then on thee; they meet thy look<br />
And brighten like the star that shook<br />
Betwixt the palms of paradise.</p>
<p>O when her life was yet in bud,<br />
He too foretold the perfect rose.<br />
For thee she grew, for thee she grows<br />
For ever, and as fair as good.</p>
<p>And thou art worthy; full of power;<br />
As gentle; liberal-minded, great,<br />
Consistent; wearing all that weight<br />
Of learning lightly like a flower.</p>
<p>But now set out: the noon is near,<br />
And I must give away the bride;<br />
She fears not, or with thee beside<br />
And me behind her, will not fear.</p>
<p>For I that danced her on my knee,<br />
That watch'd her on her nurse's arm,<br />
That shielded all her life from harm<br />
At last must part with her to thee;</p>
<p>Now waiting to be made a wife,<br />
Her feet, my darling, on the dead<br />
Their pensive tablets round her head,<br />
And the most living words of life</p>
<p>Breathed in her ear. The ring is on,<br />
The ‘wilt thou' answer'd, and again<br />
The ‘wilt thou' ask'd, till out of twain<br />
Her sweet ‘I will' has made you one.</p>
<p>Now sign your names, which shall be read,<br />
Mute symbols of a joyful morn,<br />
By village eyes as yet unborn;<br />
The names are sign'd, and overhead</p>
<p>Begins the clash and clang that tells<br />
The joy to every wandering breeze;<br />
The blind wall rocks, and on the trees<br />
The dead leaf trembles to the bells.</p>
<p>O happy hour, and happier hours<br />
Await them. Many a merry face<br />
Salutes them--maidens of the place,<br />
That pelt us in the porch with flowers.</p>
<p>O happy hour, behold the bride<br />
With him to whom her hand I gave.<br />
They leave the porch, they pass the grave<br />
That has to-day its sunny side.</p>
<p>To-day the grave is bright for me,<br />
For them the light of life increased,<br />
Who stay to share the morning feast,<br />
Who rest to-night beside the sea.</p>
<p>Let all my genial spirits advance<br />
To meet and greet a whiter sun;<br />
My drooping memory will not shun<br />
The foaming grape of eastern France.</p>
<p>It circles round, and fancy plays,<br />
And hearts are warm'd and faces bloom,<br />
As drinking health to bride and groom<br />
We wish them store of happy days.</p>
<p>Nor count me all to blame if I<br />
Conjecture of a stiller guest,<br />
Perchance, perchance, among the rest,<br />
And, tho' in silence, wishing joy.</p>
<p>But they must go, the time draws on,<br />
And those white-favour'd horses wait;<br />
They rise, but linger; it is late;<br />
Farewell, we kiss, and they are gone.</p>
<p>A shade falls on us like the dark<br />
From little cloudlets on the grass,<br />
But sweeps away as out we pass<br />
To range the woods, to roam the park,</p>
<p>Discussing how their courtship grew,<br />
And talk of others that are wed,<br />
And how she look'd, and what he said,<br />
And back we come at fall of dew.</p>
<p>Again the feast, the speech, the glee,<br />
The shade of passing thought, the wealth<br />
Of words and wit, the double health,<br />
The crowning cup, the three-times-three,</p>
<p>And last the dance;--till I retire:<br />
Dumb is that tower which spake so loud,<br />
And high in heaven the streaming cloud,<br />
And on the downs a rising fire:</p>
<p>And rise, O moon, from yonder down,<br />
Till over down and over dale<br />
All night the shining vapour sail<br />
And pass the silent-lighted town,</p>
<p>The white-faced halls, the glancing rills,<br />
And catch at every mountain head,<br />
And o'er the friths that branch and spread<br />
Their sleeping silver thro' the hills;</p>
<p><span id="bridal_doors"></span>And touch with shade the bridal doors,<br />
With tender gloom the roof, the wall;<br />
And breaking let the splendour fall<br />
To spangle all the happy shores</p>
<p>By which they rest, and ocean sounds,<br />
And, star and system rolling past,<br />
A soul shall draw from out the vast<br />
And strike his being into bounds,</p>
<p>And, moved thro' life of lower phase,<br />
Result in man, be born and think,<br />
And act and love, a closer link<br />
Betwixt us and the crowning race</p>
<p>Of those that, eye to eye, shall look<br />
On knowledge, under whose command<br />
Is Earth and Earth's, and in their hand<br />
Is Nature like an open book;</p>
<p>No longer half-akin to brute,<br />
For all we thought and loved and did,<br />
And hoped, and suffer'd, is but seed<br />
Of what in them is flower and fruit;</p>
<p>Whereof the man, that with me trod<br />
This planet, was a noble type<br />
Appearing ere the times were ripe,<br />
That friend of mine who lives in God,</p>
<p>That God, which ever lives and loves,<br />
One God, one law, one element,<br />
And one far-off divine event,<br />
To which the whole creation moves.</p>

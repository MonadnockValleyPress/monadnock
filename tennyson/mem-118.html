<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>CXVIII</h3>
<p>
Contemplate all this work of Time,<br/>
The giant labouring in his youth;<br/>
Nor dream of human love and truth,<br/>
As dying Nature's earth and lime;
</p>
<p>
But trust that those we call the dead<br/>
Are breathers of an ampler day<br/>
For ever nobler ends. They say,<br/>
The solid earth whereon we tread
</p>
<p>
In tracts of fluent heat began,<br/>
And grew to seeming-random forms,<br/>
The seeming prey of cyclic storms,<br/>
Till at the last arose the man;
</p>
<p>
Who throve and branch'd from clime to clime,<br/>
The herald of a higher race,<br/>
And of himself in higher place,<br/>
If so he type this work of time
</p>
<p>
Within himself, from more to more;<br/>
Or, crown'd with attributes of woe<br/>
Like glories, move his course, and show<br/>
That life is not as idle ore,
</p>
<p>
But iron dug from central gloom,<br/>
And heated hot with burning fears,<br/>
And dipt in baths of hissing tears,<br/>
And batter'd with the shocks of doom
</p>
<p>
To shape and use. Arise and fly<br/>
The reeling Faun, the sensual feast;<br/>
Move upward, working out the beast,<br/>
And let the ape and tiger die.

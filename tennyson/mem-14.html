<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>XIV</h3>
<p>
If one should bring me this report,<br/>
That thou hadst touch'd the land to-day,<br/>
And I went down unto the quay,<br/>
And found thee lying in the port;
</p>
<p>
And standing, muffled round with woe,<br/>
Should see thy passengers in rank<br/>
Come stepping lightly down the plank,<br/>
And beckoning unto those they know;
</p>
<p>
And if along with these should come<br/>
The man I held as half-divine;<br/>
Should strike a sudden hand in mine,<br/>
And ask a thousand things of home;
</p>
<p>
And I should tell him all my pain,<br/>
And how my life had droop'd of late,<br/>
And he should sorrow o'er my state<br/>
And marvel what possess'd my brain;
</p>
<p>
And I perceived no touch of change,<br/>
No hint of death in all his frame,<br/>
But found him all in all the same,<br/>
I should not feel it to be strange.

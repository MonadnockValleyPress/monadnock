<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>
Strong Son of God, immortal Love,<br/>
Whom we, that have not seen thy face,<br/>
By faith, and faith alone, embrace,<br/>
Believing where we cannot prove;
</p>
<p>
Thine are these orbs of light and shade;<br/>
Thou madest Life in man and brute;<br/>
Thou madest Death; and lo, thy foot<br/>
Is on the skull which thou hast made.
</p>
<p>
Thou wilt not leave us in the dust:<br/>
Thou madest man, he knows not why,<br/>
He thinks he was not made to die;<br/>
And thou hast made him: thou art just.
</p>
<p>
Thou seemest human and divine,<br/>
The highest, holiest manhood, thou.<br/>
Our wills are ours, we know not how;<br/>
Our wills are ours, to make them thine.
</p>
<p>
Our little systems have their day;<br/>
They have their day and cease to be:<br/>
They are but broken lights of thee,<br/>
And thou, O Lord, art more than they.
</p>
<p>
We have but faith: we cannot know;<br/>
For knowledge is of things we see<br/>
And yet we trust it comes from thee,<br/>
A beam in darkness: let it grow.
</p>
<p>
Let knowledge grow from more to more,<br/>
But more of reverence in us dwell;<br/>
That mind and soul, according well,<br/>
May make one music as before,
</p>
<p>
But vaster. We are fools and slight;<br/>
We mock thee when we do not fear:<br/>
But help thy foolish ones to bear;<br/>
Help thy vain worlds to bear thy light.
</p>
<p>
Forgive what seem'd my sin in me;<br/>
What seem'd my worth since I began;<br/>
For merit lives from man to man,<br/>
And not from man, O Lord, to thee.
</p>
<p>
Forgive my grief for one removed,<br/>
Thy creature, whom I found so fair.<br/>
I trust he lives in thee, and there<br/>
I find him worthier to be loved.
</p>
<p>
Forgive these wild and wandering cries,<br/>
Confusions of a wasted youth;<br/>
Forgive them where they fail in truth,<br/>
And in thy wisdom make me wise.

<h1>Break, Break, Break</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson (~1834)</h2>
<p>
Break, break, break,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On thy cold gray stones, O Sea!<br/>
And I would that my tongue could utter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts that arise in me.
</p>
<p>
O well for the fisherman’s boy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he shouts with his sister at play!<br/>
O well for the sailor lad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he sings in his boat on the bay!
</p>
<p>
And the stately ships go on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To their haven under the hill;<br/>
But O for the touch of a vanish’d hand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sound of a voice that is still!
</p>
<p>
Break, break, break,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot of thy crags, O sea!<br/>
But the tender grace of a day that is dead<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will never come back to me.

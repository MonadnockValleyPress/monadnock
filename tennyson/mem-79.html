<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>LXXIX</h3>
<p>
'More than my brothers are to me,'?<br/>
Let this not vex thee, noble heart!<br/>
I know thee of what force thou art<br/>
To hold the costliest love in fee.
</p>
<p>
But thou and I are one in kind,<br/>
As moulded like in Nature's mint;<br/>
And hill and wood and field did print<br/>
The same sweet forms in either mind.
</p>
<p>
For us the same cold streamlet curl'd<br/>
Thro' all his eddying coves, the same<br/>
All winds that roam the twilight came<br/>
In whispers of the beauteous world.
</p>
<p>
At one dear knee we proffer'd vows,<br/>
One lesson from one book we learn'd,<br/>
Ere childhood's flaxen ringlet turn'd<br/>
To black and brown on kindred brows.
</p>
<p>
And so my wealth resembles thine,<br/>
But he was rich where I was poor,<br/>
And he supplied my want the more<br/>
As his unlikeness fitted mine.

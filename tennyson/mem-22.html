<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>XXII</h3>
<p>
The path by which we twain did go,<br/>
Which led by tracts that pleased us well,<br/>
Thro' four sweet years arose and fell,<br/>
From flower to flower, from snow to snow:
</p>
<p>
And we with singing cheer'd the way,<br/>
And, crown'd with all the season lent,<br/>
From April on to April went,<br/>
And glad at heart from May to May:
</p>
<p>
But where the path we walk'd began<br/>
To slant the fifth autumnal slope,<br/>
As we descended following Hope,<br/>
There sat the Shadow fear'd of man;
</p>
<p>
Who broke our fair companionship,<br/>
And spread his mantle dark and cold,<br/>
And wrapt thee formless in the fold,<br/>
And dull'd the murmur on thy lip,
</p>
<p>
And bore thee where I could not see<br/>
Nor follow, tho' I walk in haste,<br/>
And think, that somewhere in the waste<br/>
The Shadow sits and waits for me.

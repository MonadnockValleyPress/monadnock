<h1>Tears, Idle Tears</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson (1847)</h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,<br/>
Tears from the depth of some divine despair<br/>
Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,<br/>
In looking on the happy Autumn-fields,<br/>
And thinking of the days that are no more.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,<br/>
That brings our friends up from the underworld,<br/>
Sad as the last which reddens over one<br/>
That sinks with all we love below the verge;<br/>
So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns<br/>
The earliest pipe of half-awakened birds<br/>
To dying ears, when unto dying eyes<br/>
The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;<br/>
So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear as remembered kisses after death,<br/>
And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned<br/>
On lips that are for others; deep as love,<br/>
Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;<br/>
O Death in Life, the days that are no more!

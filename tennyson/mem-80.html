<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>LXXX</h3>
<p>
If any vague desire should rise,<br/>
That holy Death ere Arthur died<br/>
Had moved me kindly from his side,<br/>
And dropt the dust on tearless eyes;
</p>
<p>
Then fancy shapes, as fancy can,<br/>
The grief my loss in him had wrought,<br/>
A grief as deep as life or thought,<br/>
But stay'd in peace with God and man.
</p>
<p>
I make a picture in the brain;<br/>
I hear the sentence that he speaks;<br/>
He bears the burthen of the weeks<br/>
But turns his burthen into gain.
</p>
<p>
His credit thus shall set me free;<br/>
And, influence-rich to soothe and save,<br/>
Unused example from the grave<br/>
Reach out dead hands to comfort me.

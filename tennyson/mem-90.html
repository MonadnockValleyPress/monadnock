<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>XC</h3>
<p>
He tasted love with half his mind,<br/>
Nor ever drank the inviolate spring<br/>
Where nighest heaven, who first could fling<br/>
This bitter seed among mankind;
</p>
<p>
That could the dead, whose dying eyes<br/>
Were closed with wail, resume their life,<br/>
They would but find in child and wife<br/>
An iron welcome when they rise:
</p>
<p>
'Twas well, indeed, when warm with wine,<br/>
To pledge them with a kindly tear,<br/>
To talk them o'er, to wish them here,<br/>
To count their memories half divine;
</p>
<p>
But if they came who past away,<br/>
Behold their brides in other hands;<br/>
The hard heir strides about their lands,<br/>
And will not yield them for a day.
</p>
<p>
Yea, tho' their sons were none of these,<br/>
Not less the yet-loved sire would make<br/>
Confusion worse than death, and shake<br/>
The pillars of domestic peace.
</p>
<p>
Ah dear, but come thou back to me:<br/>
Whatever change the years have wrought,<br/>
I find not yet one lonely thought<br/>
That cries against my wish for thee.

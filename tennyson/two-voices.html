<h1>The Two Voices</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<p>
A still small voice spake unto me,<br/>
&quot;Thou art so full of misery,<br/>
Were it not better not to be?&quot;
</p>
<p>
Then to the still small voice I said;<br/>
&quot;Let me not cast in endless shade<br/>
What is so wonderfully made&quot;.
</p>
<p>
To which the voice did urge reply;<br/>
&quot;To-day I saw the dragon-fly<br/>
Come from the wells where he did lie.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;An inner impulse rent the veil<br/>
Of his old husk: from head to tail<br/>
Came out clear plates of sapphire mail.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;He dried his wings: like gauze they grew:<br/>
Thro' crofts and pastures wet with dew<br/>
A living flash of light he flew.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
I said, &quot;When first the world began<br/>
Young Nature thro' five cycles ran,<br/>
And in the sixth she moulded man.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;She gave him mind, the lordliest<br/>
Proportion, and, above the rest,<br/>
Dominion in the head and breast.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
Thereto the silent voice replied;<br/>
&quot;Self-blinded are you by your pride:<br/>
Look up thro' night: the world is wide.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;This truth within thy mind rehearse,<br/>
That in a boundless universe<br/>
Is boundless better, boundless worse.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Think you this mould of hopes and fears<br/>
Could find no statelier than his peers<br/>
In yonder hundred million spheres?&quot;
</p>
<p> 
It spake, moreover, in my mind:<br/>
&quot;Tho' thou wert scatter'd to the wind,<br/>
Yet is there plenty of the kind&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
Then did my response clearer fall:<br/>
&quot;No compound of this earthly ball<br/>
Is like another, all in all&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
To which he answer'd scoffingly;<br/>
&quot;Good soul! suppose I grant it thee,<br/>
Who'll weep for thy deficiency?
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Or will one beam be less intense,<br/>
When thy peculiar difference<br/>
Is cancell'd in the world of sense?&quot;
</p>
<p> 
I would have said, &quot;Thou canst not know,&quot;<br/>
But my full heart, that work'd below,<br/>
Rain'd thro' my sight its overflow.
</p>
<p> 
Again the voice spake unto me:<br/>
&quot;Thou art so steep'd in misery,<br/>
Surely 'twere better not to be.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Thine anguish will not let thee sleep,<br/>
Nor any train of reason keep:<br/>
Thou canst not think, but thou wilt weep.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
I said, &quot;The years with change advance:<br/>
If I make dark my countenance,<br/>
I shut my life from happier chance.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Some turn this sickness yet might take,<br/>
Ev'n yet.&quot; But he: &quot;What drug can make<br/>
A wither'd palsy cease to shake?&quot;
</p>
<p> 
I wept, &quot;Tho' I should die, I know<br/>
That all about the thorn will blow<br/>
In tufts of rosy-tinted snow;
</p>
<p> 
&quot;And men, thro' novel spheres of thought<br/>
Still moving after truth long sought,<br/>
Will learn new things when I am not.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Yet,&quot; said the secret voice, &quot;some time,<br/>
Sooner or later, will gray prime<br/>
Make thy grass hoar with early rime.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Not less swift souls that yearn for light,<br/>
Rapt after heaven's starry flight,<br/>
Would sweep the tracts of day and night.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Not less the bee would range her cells,<br/>
The furzy prickle fire the dells,<br/>
The foxglove cluster dappled bells.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
I said that &quot;all the years invent;<br/>
Each month is various to present<br/>
The world with some development.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Were this not well, to bide mine hour,<br/>
Tho' watching from a ruin'd tower<br/>
How grows the day of human power?&quot;
</p>
<p> 
&quot;The highest-mounted mind,&quot; he said,<br/>
&quot;Still sees the sacred morning spread<br/>
The silent summit overhead.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Will thirty seasons render plain<br/>
Those lonely lights that still remain,<br/>
Just breaking over land and main?
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Or make that morn, from his cold crown<br/>
And crystal silence creeping down,<br/>
Flood with full daylight glebe and town?
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Forerun thy peers, thy time, and let<br/>
Thy feet, millenniums hence, be set<br/>
In midst of knowledge, dream'd not yet.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Thou hast not gain'd a real height,<br/>
Nor art thou nearer to the light,<br/>
Because the scale is infinite.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;'Twere better not to breathe or speak,<br/>
Than cry for strength, remaining weak,<br/>
And seem to find, but still to seek.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Moreover, but to seem to find<br/>
Asks what thou lackest, thought resign'd,<br/>
A healthy frame, a quiet mind.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
I said, &quot;When I am gone away,<br/>
'He dared not tarry,' men will say,<br/>
Doing dishonour to my clay.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
&quot;This is more vile,&quot; he made reply,<br/>
&quot;To breathe and loathe, to live and sigh,<br/>
Than once from dread of pain to die.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Sick art thou &#151; a divided will<br/>
Still heaping on the fear of ill<br/>
The fear of men, a coward still.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Do men love thee? Art thou so bound<br/>
To men, that how thy name may sound<br/>
Will vex thee lying underground?
</p>
<p> 
&quot;The memory of the wither'd leaf<br/>
In endless time is scarce more brief<br/>
Than of the garner'd Autumn-sheaf.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Go, vexed Spirit, sleep in trust;<br/>
The right ear, that is fill'd with dust,<br/>
Hears little of the false or just.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Hard task, to pluck resolve,&quot; I cried,<br/>
&quot;From emptiness and the waste wide<br/>
Of that abyss, or scornful pride!
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Nay &#151; rather yet that I could raise<br/>
One hope that warm'd me in the days<br/>
While still I yearn'd for human praise.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;When, wide in soul, and bold of tongue,<br/>
Among the tents I paused and sung,<br/>
The distant battle flash'd and rung.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;I sung the joyful Paean clear,<br/>
And, sitting, burnish'd without fear<br/>
The brand, the buckler, and the spear &#151; 
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Waiting to strive a happy strife,<br/>
To war with falsehood to the knife,<br/>
And not to lose the good of life &#151; 
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Some hidden principle to move,<br/>
To put together, part and prove,<br/>
And mete the bounds of hate and love &#151; 
</p>
<p> 
&quot;As far as might be, to carve out<br/>
Free space for every human doubt,<br/>
That the whole mind might orb about &#151; 
</p>
<p> 
&quot;To search thro' all I felt or saw,<br/>
The springs of life, the depths of awe,<br/>
And reach the law within the law:
</p>
<p> 
&quot;At least, not rotting like a weed,<br/>
But, having sown some generous seed,<br/>
Fruitful of further thought and deed,
</p>
<p> 
&quot;To pass, when Life her light withdraws,<br/>
Not void of righteous self-applause,<br/>
Nor in a merely selfish cause &#151; 
</p>
<p> 
&quot;In some good cause, not in mine own,<br/>
To perish, wept for, honour'd, known,<br/>
And like a warrior overthrown;
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Whose eyes are dim with glorious tears,<br/>
When, soil'd with noble dust, he hears<br/>
His country's war-song thrill his ears:
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Then dying of a mortal stroke,<br/>
What time the foeman's line is broke.<br/>
And all the war is roll'd in smoke.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Yea!&quot; said the voice, &quot;thy dream was good,<br/>
While thou abodest in the bud.<br/>
It was the stirring of the blood.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;If Nature put not forth her power<br/>
About the opening of the flower,<br/>
Who is it that could live an hour?
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Then comes the check, the change, the fall.<br/>
Pain rises up, old pleasures pall.<br/>
There is one remedy for all.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Yet hadst thou, thro' enduring pain,<br/>
Link'd month to month with such a chain<br/>
Of knitted purport, all were vain.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Thou hadst not between death and birth<br/>
Dissolved the riddle of the earth.<br/>
So were thy labour little worth.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;That men with knowledge merely play'd,<br/>
I told thee &#151; hardly nigher made,<br/>
Tho' scaling slow from grade to grade;
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Much less this dreamer, deaf and blind,<br/>
Named man, may hope some truth to find,<br/>
That bears relation to the mind.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;For every worm beneath the moon<br/>
Draws different threads, and late and soon<br/>
Spins, toiling out his own cocoon.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Cry, faint not: either Truth is born<br/>
Beyond the polar gleam forlorn,<br/>
Or in the gateways of the morn.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Cry, faint not, climb: the summits slope<br/>
Beyond the furthest nights of hope,<br/>
Wrapt in dense cloud from base to cope.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Sometimes a little corner shines,<br/>
As over rainy mist inclines<br/>
A gleaming crag with belts of pines.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;I will go forward, sayest thou,<br/>
I shall not fail to find her now.<br/>
Look up, the fold is on her brow.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;If straight thy track, or if oblique,<br/>
Thou know'st not. Shadows thou dost strike,<br/>
Embracing cloud, Ixion-like;
</p>
<p> 
&quot;And owning but a little more<br/>
Than beasts, abidest lame and poor,<br/>
Calling thyself a little lower
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Than angels. Cease to wail and brawl!<br/>
Why inch by inch to darkness crawl?<br/>
There is one remedy for all.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
&quot;O dull, one-sided voice,&quot; said I,<br/>
&quot;Wilt thou make everything a lie,<br/>
To flatter me that I may die?
</p>
<p> 
&quot;I know that age to age succeeds,<br/>
Blowing a noise of tongues and deeds,<br/>
A dust of systems and of creeds.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;I cannot hide that some have striven,<br/>
Achieving calm, to whom was given<br/>
The joy that mixes man with Heaven:
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Who, rowing hard against the stream,<br/>
Saw distant gates of Eden gleam,<br/>
And did not dream it was a dream;
</p>
<p> 
&quot;But heard, by secret transport led,<br/>
Ev'n in the charnels of the dead,<br/>
The murmur of the fountainhead &#151; 
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Which did accomplish their desire, &#151; <br/>
Bore and forbore, and did not tire,<br/>
Like Stephen, an unquenched fire.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;He heeded not reviling tones,<br/>
Nor sold his heart to idle moans,<br/>
Tho' cursed and scorn'd, and bruised with stones:
</p>
<p> 
&quot;But looking upward, full of grace,<br/>
He pray'd, and from a happy place<br/>
God's glory smote him on the face.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
The sullen answer slid betwixt:<br/>
&quot;Not that the grounds of hope were fix'd,<br/>
The elements were kindlier mix'd.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
I said, &quot;I toil beneath the curse,<br/>
But, knowing not the universe,<br/>
I fear to slide from bad to worse.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;And that, in seeking to undo<br/>
One riddle, and to find the true,<br/>
I knit a hundred others new:
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Or that this anguish fleeting hence,<br/>
Unmanacled from bonds of sense,<br/>
Be fix'd and froz'n to permanence:
</p>
<p> 
&quot;For I go, weak from suffering here;<br/>
Naked I go, and void of cheer:<br/>
What is it that I may not fear?&quot;
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Consider well,&quot; the voice replied,<br/>
&quot;His face, that two hours since hath died;<br/>
Wilt thou find passion, pain or pride?
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Will he obey when one commands?<br/>
Or answer should one press his hands?<br/>
He answers not, nor understands.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;His palms are folded on his breast:<br/>
There is no other thing express'd<br/>
But long disquiet merged in rest.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;His lips are very mild and meek:<br/>
Tho' one should smite him on the cheek,<br/>
And on the mouth, he will not speak.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;His little daughter, whose sweet face<br/>
He kiss'd, taking his last embrace,<br/>
Becomes dishonour to her race &#151; 
</p>
<p> 
&quot;His sons grow up that bear his name,<br/>
Some grow to honour, some to shame, &#151; <br/>
But he is chill to praise or blame.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;He will not hear the north wind rave,<br/>
Nor, moaning, household shelter crave<br/>
From winter rains that beat his grave.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;High up the vapours fold and swim:<br/>
About him broods the twilight dim:<br/>
The place he knew forgetteth him.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
&quot;If all be dark, vague voice,&quot; I said,<br/>
&quot;These things are wrapt in doubt and dread,<br/>
Nor canst thou show the dead are dead.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;The sap dries up: the plant declines.<br/>
A deeper tale my heart divines.<br/>
Know I not Death? the outward signs?
</p>
<p> 
&quot;I found him when my years were few;<br/>
A shadow on the graves I knew,<br/>
And darkness in the village yew.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;From grave to grave the shadow crept:<br/>
In her still place the morning wept:<br/>
Touch'd by his feet the daisy slept.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;The simple senses crown'd his head:<br/>
'Omega! thou art Lord,' they<br/>
said; 'We find no motion in the dead.'
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Why, if man rot in dreamless ease,<br/>
Should that plain fact, as taught by these,<br/>
Not make him sure that he shall cease?
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Who forged that other influence,<br/>
That heat of inward evidence,<br/>
By which he doubts against the sense?
</p>
<p> 
&quot;He owns the fatal gift of eyes,<br/>
That read his spirit blindly wise,<br/>
Not simple as a thing that dies.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Here sits he shaping wings to fly:<br/>
His heart forebodes a mystery:<br/>
He names the name Eternity.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;That type of Perfect in his mind<br/>
In Nature can he nowhere find.<br/>
He sows himself in every wind.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;He seems to hear a Heavenly Friend,<br/>
And thro' thick veils to apprehend<br/>
A labour working to an end.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;The end and the beginning vex<br/>
His reason: many things perplex,<br/>
With motions, checks, and counterchecks.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;He knows a baseness in his blood<br/>
At such strange war with something good,<br/>
He may not do the thing he would.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Heaven opens inward, chasms yawn.<br/>
Vast images in glimmering dawn,<br/>
Half shown, are broken and withdrawn.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Ah! sure within him and without,<br/>
Could his dark wisdom find it out,<br/>
There must be answer to his doubt.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;But thou canst answer not again.<br/>
With thine own weapon art thou slain,<br/>
Or thou wilt answer but in vain.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;The doubt would rest, I dare not solve.<br/>
In the same circle we revolve.<br/>
Assurance only breeds resolve.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
As when a billow, blown against,<br/>
Falls back, the voice with which I fenced<br/>
A little ceased, but recommenced.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Where wert thou when thy father play'd<br/>
In his free field, and pastime made,<br/>
A merry boy in sun and shade?
</p>
<p> 
&quot;A merry boy they called him then.<br/>
He sat upon the knees of men<br/>
In days that never come again,
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Before the little ducts began<br/>
To feed thy bones with lime, and ran<br/>
Their course, till thou wert also man:
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Who took a wife, who rear'd his race,<br/>
Whose wrinkles gather'd on his face,<br/>
Whose troubles number with his days:
</p>
<p> 
&quot;A life of nothings, nothing-worth,<br/>
From that first nothing ere his birth<br/>
To that last nothing under earth!&quot;
</p>
<p> 
&quot;These words,&quot; I said, &quot;are like the rest,<br/>
No certain clearness, but at best<br/>
A vague suspicion of the breast:
</p>
<p> 
&quot;But if I grant, thou might'st defend<br/>
The thesis which thy words intend &#151; <br/>
That to begin implies to end;
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Yet how should I for certain hold,<br/>
Because my memory is so cold,<br/>
That I first was in human mould?
</p>
<p> 
&quot;I cannot make this matter plain,<br/>
But I would shoot, howe'er in vain,<br/>
A random arrow from the brain.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;It may be that no life is found,<br/>
Which only to one engine bound<br/>
Falls off, but cycles always round.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;As old mythologies relate,<br/>
Some draught of Lethe might await<br/>
The slipping thro' from state to state.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;As here we find in trances, men<br/>
Forget the dream that happens then,<br/>
Until they fall in trance again.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;So might we, if our state were such<br/>
As one before, remember much,<br/>
For those two likes might meet and touch.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;But, if I lapsed from nobler place,<br/>
Some legend of a fallen race<br/>
Alone might hint of my disgrace;
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Some vague emotion of delight<br/>
In gazing up an Alpine height,<br/>
Some yearning toward the lamps of night.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Or if thro' lower lives I came &#151; <br/>
Tho' all experience past became<br/>
Consolidate in mind and frame &#151; 
</p>
<p> 
&quot;I might forget my weaker lot;<br/>
For is not our first year forgot?<br/>
The haunts of memory echo not.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;And men, whose reason long was blind,<br/>
From cells of madness unconfined,<br/>
Oft lose whole years of darker mind.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Much more, if first I floated free,<br/>
As naked essence, must I be<br/>
Incompetent of memory:
</p>
<p> 
&quot;For memory dealing but with time,<br/>
And he with matter, could she climb<br/>
Beyond her own material prime?
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Moreover, something is or seems,<br/>
That touches me with mystic gleams,<br/>
Like glimpses of forgotten dreams &#151; 
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Of something felt, like something here;<br/>
Of something done, I know not where;<br/>
Such as no language may declare.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
The still voice laugh'd. &quot;I talk,&quot; said he,<br/>
&quot;Not with thy dreams.<br/>
Suffice it thee Thy pain is a reality.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
&quot;But thou,&quot; said I, &quot;hast miss'd thy mark,<br/>
Who sought'st to wreck my mortal ark,<br/>
By making all the horizon dark.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Why not set forth, if I should do<br/>
This rashness, that which might ensue<br/>
With this old soul in organs new?
</p>
<p> 
&quot;Whatever crazy sorrow saith,<br/>
No life that breathes with human breath<br/>
Has ever truly long'd for death.
</p>
<p> 
&quot;'Tis life, whereof our nerves are scant,<br/>
Oh life, not death, for which we pant;<br/>
More life, and fuller, that I want.&quot;
</p>
<p> 
I ceased, and sat as one forlorn.<br/>
Then said the voice, in quiet scorn,<br/>
&quot;Behold it is the Sabbath morn&quot;.
</p>
<p
> And I arose, and I released<br/>
The casement, and the light increased<br/>
With freshness in the dawning east.
</p>
<p> 
Like soften'd airs that blowing steal,<br/>
When meres begin to uncongeal,<br/>
The sweet church bells began to peal.
</p>
<p> 
On to God's house the people prest:<br/>
Passing the place where each must rest,<br/>
Each enter'd like a welcome guest.
</p>
<p> 
One walk'd between his wife and child,<br/>
With measur'd footfall firm and mild,<br/>
And now and then he gravely smiled.
</p>
<p> 
The prudent partner of his blood<br/>
Lean'd on him, faithful, gentle, good,<br/>
Wearing the rose of womanhood.
</p>
<p> 
And in their double love secure,<br/>
The little maiden walk'd demure,<br/>
Pacing with downward eyelids pure.
</p>
<p> 
These three made unity so sweet,<br/>
My frozen heart began to beat,<br/>
Remembering its ancient heat.
</p>
<p> 
I blest them, and they wander'd on:<br/>
I spoke, but answer came there none:<br/>
The dull and bitter voice was gone.
</p>
<p> 
A second voice was at mine ear,<br/>
A little whisper silver-clear,<br/>
A murmur, &quot;Be of better cheer&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
As from some blissful neighbourhood,<br/>
A notice faintly understood,<br/>
&quot;I see the end, and know the good&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
A little hint to solace woe,<br/>
A hint, a whisper breathing low,<br/>
&quot;I may not speak of what I know&quot;.
</p>
<p> 
Like an Aeolian harp that wakes<br/>
No certain air, but overtakes<br/>
Far thought with music that it makes:
</p>
<p> 
Such seem'd the whisper at my side:<br/>
&quot;What is it thou knowest, sweet voice?&quot; I cried.<br/>
&quot;A hidden hope,&quot; the voice replied:
</p>
<p> 
So heavenly-toned, that in that hour<br/>
From out my sullen heart a power<br/>
Broke, like the rainbow from the shower,
</p>
<p> 
To feel, altho' no tongue can prove<br/>
That every cloud, that spreads above<br/>
And veileth love, itself is love.
</p>
<p> 
And forth into the fields I went,<br/>
And Nature's living motion lent<br/>
The pulse of hope to discontent.
</p>
<p> 
I wonder'd at the bounteous hours,<br/>
The slow result of winter showers:<br/>
You scarce could see the grass for flowers.
</p>
<p> 
I wonder'd, while I paced along:<br/>
The woods were fill'd so full with song,<br/>
There seem'd no room for sense of wrong.
</p>
<p> 
So variously seem'd all things wrought,<br/>
I marvell'd how the mind was brought<br/>
To anchor by one gloomy thought;
</p>
<p> 
And wherefore rather I made choice<br/>
To commune with that barren voice,<br/>
Than him that said, &quot;Rejoice! rejoice!&quot;

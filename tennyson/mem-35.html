<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>XXXV</h3>
<p>
Yet if some voice that man could trust<br/>
Should murmur from the narrow house,<br/>
'The cheeks drop in; the body bows;<br/>
Man dies: nor is there hope in dust:'
</p>
<p>
Might I not say? 'Yet even here,<br/>
But for one hour, O Love, I strive<br/>
To keep so sweet a thing alive:'<br/>
But I should turn mine ears and hear
</p>
<p>
The moanings of the homeless sea,<br/>
The sound of streams that swift or slow<br/>
Draw down Ã†onian hills, and sow<br/>
The dust of continents to be;
</p>
<p>
And Love would answer with a sigh,<br/>
'The sound of that forgetful shore<br/>
Will change my sweetness more and more,<br/>
Half-dead to know that I shall die.'
</p>
<p>
O me, what profits it to put<br/>
An idle case? If Death were seen<br/>
At first as Death, Love had not been,<br/>
Or been in narrowest working shut,
</p>
<p>
Mere fellowship of sluggish moods,<br/>
Or in his coarsest Satyr-shape<br/>
Had bruised the herb and crush'd the grape,<br/>
And bask'd and batten'd in the woods.

<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>CXXVIII</h3>
<p>
The love that rose on stronger wings,<br/>
Unpalsied when he met with Death,<br/>
Is comrade of the lesser faith<br/>
That sees the course of human things.
</p>
<p>
No doubt vast eddies in the flood<br/>
Of onward time shall yet be made,<br/>
And throned races may degrade;<br/>
Yet, O ye mysteries of good,
</p>
<p>
Wild Hours that fly with Hope and Fear,<br/>
If all your office had to do<br/>
With old results that look like new;<br/>
If this were all your mission here,
</p>
<p>
To draw, to sheathe a useless sword,<br/>
To fool the crowd with glorious lies,<br/>
To cleave a creed in sects and cries,<br/>
To change the bearing of a word,
</p>
<p>
To shift an arbitrary power,<br/>
To cramp the student at his desk,<br/>
To make old bareness picturesque<br/>
And tuft with grass a feudal tower;
</p>
<p>
Why then my scorn might well descend<br/>
On you and yours. I see in part<br/>
That all, as in some piece of art,<br/>
Is toil c√∂operant to an end.

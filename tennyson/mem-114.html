<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>CXIV</h3>
<p>
Who loves not Knowledge? Who shall rail<br/>
Against her beauty? May she mix<br/>
With men and prosper! Who shall fix<br/>
Her pillars? Let her work prevail.
</p>
<p>
But on her forehead sits a fire:<br/>
She sets her forward countenance<br/>
And leaps into the future chance,<br/>
Submitting all things to desire.
</p>
<p>
Half-grown as yet, a child, and vain?<br/>
She cannot fight the fear of death.<br/>
What is she, cut from love and faith,<br/>
But some wild Pallas from the brain
</p>
<p>
Of Demons? fiery-hot to burst<br/>
All barriers in her onward race<br/>
For power. Let her know her place;<br/>
She is the second, not the first.
</p>
<p>
A higher hand must make her mild,<br/>
If all be not in vain; and guide<br/>
Her footsteps, moving side by side<br/>
With wisdom, like the younger child:
</p>
<p>
For she is earthly of the mind,<br/>
But Wisdom heavenly of the soul.<br/>
O, friend, who camest to thy goal<br/>
So early, leaving me behind,
</p>
<p>
I would the great world grew like thee,<br/>
Who grewest not alone in power<br/>
And knowledge, but by year and hour<br/>
In reverence and in charity.

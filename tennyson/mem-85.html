<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>LXXXV</h3>
<p>
This truth came borne with bier and pall,<br/>
I felt it, when I sorrow'd most,<br/>
'Tis better to have loved and lost,<br/>
Than never to have loved at all&mdash;
</p>
<p>
O true in word, and tried in deed,<br/>
Demanding, so to bring relief<br/>
To this which is our common grief,<br/>
What kind of life is that I lead;
</p>
<p>
And whether trust in things above<br/>
Be dimm'd of sorrow, or sustain'd;<br/>
And whether love for him have drain'd<br/>
My capabilities of love;
</p>
<p>
Your words have virtue such as draws<br/>
A faithful answer from the breast,<br/>
Thro' light reproaches, half exprest,<br/>
And loyal unto kindly laws.
</p>
<p>
My blood an even tenor kept,<br/>
Till on mine ear this message falls,<br/>
That in Vienna's fatal walls<br/>
God's finger touch'd him, and he slept.
</p>
<p>
The great Intelligences fair<br/>
That range above our mortal state,<br/>
In circle round the blessed gate,<br/>
Received and gave him welcome there;
</p>
<p>
And led him thro' the blissful climes,<br/>
And show'd him in the fountain fresh<br/>
All knowledge that the sons of flesh<br/>
Shall gather in the cycled times.
</p>
<p>
But I remain'd, whose hopes were dim,<br/>
Whose life, whose thoughts were little worth,<br/>
To wander on a darken'd earth,<br/>
Where all things round me breathed of him.'
</p>
<p>
O friendship, equal-poised control,<br/>
O heart, with kindliest motion warm,<br/>
O sacred essence, other form,<br/>
O solemn ghost, O crowned soul!
</p>
<p>
Yet none could better know than I,<br/>
How much of act at human hands<br/>
The sense of human will demands<br/>
By which we dare to live or die.
</p>
<p>
Whatever way my days decline,<br/>
I felt and feel, tho' left alone,<br/>
His being working in mine own,<br/>
The footsteps of his life in mine;
</p>
<p>
A life that all the Muses deck'd<br/>
With gifts of grace, that might express<br/>
All-comprehensive tenderness,<br/>
All-subtilising intellect:
</p>
<p>
And so my passion hath not swerved<br/>
To works of weakness, but I find<br/>
An image comforting the mind,<br/>
And in my grief a strength reserved.
</p>
<p>
Likewise the imaginative woe,<br/>
That loved to handle spiritual strife<br/>
Diffused the shock thro' all my life,<br/>
But in the present broke the blow.
</p>
<p>
My pulses therefore beat again<br/>
For other friends that once I met;<br/>
Nor can it suit me to forget<br/>
The mighty hopes that make us men.
</p>
<p>
I woo your love: I count it crime<br/>
To mourn for any overmuch;<br/>
I, the divided half of such<br/>
A friendship as had master'd Time;
</p>
<p>
Which masters Time indeed, and is<br/>
Eternal, separate from fears:<br/>
The all-assuming months and years<br/>
Can take no part away from this:
</p>
<p>
But Summer on the steaming floods,<br/>
And Spring that swells the narrow brooks,<br/>
And Autumn, with a noise of rooks,<br/>
That gather in the waning woods,
</p>
<p>
And every pulse of wind and wave<br/>
Recalls, in change of light or gloom,<br/>
My old affection of the tomb,<br/>
And my prime passion in the grave:
</p>
<p>
My old affection of the tomb,<br/>
A part of stillness, yearns to speak:<br/>
'Arise, and get thee forth and seek<br/>
A friendship for the years to come.
</p>
<p>
'I watch thee from the quiet shore;<br/>
Thy spirit up to mine can reach;<br/>
But in dear words of human speech<br/>
We two communicate no more.'
</p>
<p>
And I, 'Can clouds of nature stain<br/>
The starry clearness of the free?<br/>
How is it? Canst thou feel for me<br/>
Some painless sympathy with pain?'
</p>
<p>
And lightly does the whisper fall:<br/>
'Tis hard for thee to fathom this;<br/>
I triumph in conclusive bliss,<br/>
And that serene result of all.'
</p>
<p>
So hold I commerce with the dead;<br/>
Or so methinks the dead would say;<br/>
Or so shall grief with symbols play<br/>
And pining life be fancy-fed.
</p>
<p>
Now looking to some settled end,<br/>
That these things pass, and I shall prove<br/>
A meeting somewhere, love with love,<br/>
I crave your pardon, O my friend;
</p>
<p>
If not so fresh, with love as true,<br/>
I, clasping brother-hands, aver<br/>
I could not, if I would, transfer<br/>
The whole I felt for him to you.
</p>
<p>
For which be they that hold apart<br/>
The promise of the golden hours?<br/>
First love, first friendship, equal powers,<br/>
That marry with the virgin heart.
</p>
<p>
Still mine, that cannot but deplore,<br/>
That beats within a lonely place,<br/>
That yet remembers his embrace,<br/>
But at his footstep leaps no more,
</p>
<p>
My heart, tho' widow'd, may not rest<br/>
Quite in the love of what is gone,<br/>
But seeks to beat in time with one<br/>
That warms another living breast.
</p>
<p>
Ah, take the imperfect gift I bring,<br/>
Knowing the primrose yet is dear,<br/>
The primrose of the later year,<br/>
As not unlike to that of Spring.

<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>XCVII</h3>
<p>
My love has talk'd with rocks and trees;<br/>
He finds on misty mountain-ground<br/>
His own vast shadow glory-crown'd;<br/>
He sees himself in all he sees.
</p>
<p>
Two partners of a married life&mdash;<br/>
I look'd on these and thought of thee<br/>
In vastness and in mystery,<br/>
And of my spirit as of a wife.
</p>
<p>
These two&mdash;they dwelt with eye on eye,<br/>
Their hearts of old have beat in tune,<br/>
Their meetings made December June<br/>
Their every parting was to die.
</p>
<p>
Their love has never past away;<br/>
The days she never can forget<br/>
Are earnest that he loves her yet,<br/>
Whate'er the faithless people say.
</p>
<p>
Her life is lone, he sits apart,<br/>
He loves her yet, she will not weep,<br/>
Tho' rapt in matters dark and deep<br/>
He seems to slight her simple heart.
</p>
<p>
He thrids the labyrinth of the mind,<br/>
He reads the secret of the star,<br/>
He seems so near and yet so far,<br/>
He looks so cold: she thinks him kind.
</p>
<p>
She keeps the gift of years before<br/>
A wither'd violet is her bliss<br/>
She knows not what his greatness is,<br/>
For that, for all, she loves him more.
</p>
<p>
For him she plays, to him she sings<br/>
Of early faith and plighted vows;<br/>
She knows but matters of the house,<br/>
And he, he knows a thousand things.
</p>
<p>
Her faith is fixt and cannot move,<br/>
She darkly feels him great and wise,<br/>
She dwells on him with faithful eyes,<br/>
'I cannot understand: I love.'

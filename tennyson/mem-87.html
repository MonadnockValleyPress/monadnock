<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>LXXXVII</h3>
<p>
I past beside the reverend walls<br/>
In which of old I wore the gown;<br/>
I roved at random thro' the town,<br/>
And saw the tumult of the halls;
</p>
<p>
And heard once more in college fanes<br/>
The storm their high-built organs make,<br/>
And thunder-music, rolling, shake<br/>
The prophet blazon'd on the panes;
</p>
<p>
And caught once more the distant shout,<br/>
The measured pulse of racing oars<br/>
Among the willows; paced the shores<br/>
And many a bridge, and all about
</p>
<p>
The same gray flats again, and felt<br/>
The same, but not the same; and last<br/>
Up that long walk of limes I past<br/>
To see the rooms in which he dwelt.
</p>
<p>
Another name was on the door:<br/>
I linger'd; all within was noise<br/>
Of songs, and clapping hands, and boys<br/>
That crash'd the glass and beat the floor;
</p>
<p>
Where once we held debate, a band<br/>
Of youthful friends, on mind and art,<br/>
And labour, and the changing mart,<br/>
And all the framework of the land;
</p>
<p>
When one would aim an arrow fair,<br/>
But send it slackly from the string;<br/>
And one would pierce an outer ring,<br/>
And one an inner, here and there;
</p>
<p>
And last the master-bowman, he,<br/>
Would cleave the mark. A willing ear<br/>
We lent him. Who, but hung to hear<br/>
The rapt oration flowing free
</p>
<p>
From point to point, with power and grace<br/>
And music in the bounds of law,<br/>
To those conclusions when we saw<br/>
The God within him light his face,
</p>
<p>
And seem to lift the form, and glow<br/>
In azure orbits heavenly-wise;<br/>
And over those ethereal eyes<br/>
The bar of Michael Angelo?

<h1>Ring Out, Wild Bells</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson (1850)</h2>
<p>
Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,<br/>
The flying cloud, the frosty light;<br/>
The year is dying in the night;<br/>
Ring out, wild bells, and let him die. 
</p>
<p>
Ring out the old, ring in the new,<br/>
Ring, happy bells, across the snow:<br/>
The year is going, let him go;<br/>
Ring out the false, ring in the true. 
</p>
<p>
Ring out the grief that saps the mind,<br/>
For those that here we see no more,<br/>
Ring out the feud of rich and poor,<br/>
Ring in redress to all mankind. 
</p>
<p>
Ring out a slowly dying cause,<br/>
And ancient forms of party strife;<br/>
Ring in the nobler modes of life,<br/>
With sweeter manners, purer laws. 
</p>
<p>
Ring out the want, the care, the sin,<br/>
The faithless coldness of the times;<br/>
Ring out, ring out thy mournful rhymes,<br/>
But ring the fuller minstrel in. 
</p>
<p>
Ring out false pride in place and blood,<br/>
The civic slander and the spite;<br/>
Ring in the love of truth and right,<br/>
Ring in the common love of good. 
</p>
<p>
Ring out old shapes of foul disease,<br/>
Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;<br/>
Ring out the thousand wars of old,<br/>
Ring in the thousand years of peace. 
</p>
<p>
Ring in the valiant man and free,<br/>
The larger heart the kindlier hand;<br/>
Ring out the darkness of the land,<br/>
Ring in the Christ that is to be.

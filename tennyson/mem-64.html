<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>LXIV</h3>
<p>
Dost thou look back on what hath been,<br/>
As some divinely gifted man,<br/>
Whose life in low estate began<br/>
And on a simple village green;
</p>
<p>
Who breaks his birth's invidious bar,<br/>
And grasps the skirts of happy chance,<br/>
And breasts the blows of circumstance,<br/>
And grapples with his evil star;
</p>
<p>
Who makes by force his merit known<br/>
And lives to clutch the golden keys,<br/>
To mould a mighty state's decrees,<br/>
And shape the whisper of the throne;
</p>
<p>
And moving up from high to higher,<br/>
Becomes on Fortune's crowning slope<br/>
The pillar of a people's hope,<br/>
The centre of a world's desire;
</p>
<p>
Yet feels, as in a pensive dream,<br/>
When all his active powers are still,<br/>
A distant dearness in the hill,<br/>
A secret sweetness in the stream,
</p>
<p>
The limit of his narrower fate,<br/>
While yet beside its vocal springs<br/>
He play'd at counsellors and kings,<br/>
With one that was his earliest mate;
</p>
<p>
Who ploughs with pain his native lea<br/>
And reaps the labour of his hands,<br/>
Or in the furrow musing stands;<br/>
'Does my old friend remember me?'

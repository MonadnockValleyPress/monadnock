<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>XXI</h3>
<p>
I sing to him that rests below,<br/>
And, since the grasses round me wave,<br/>
I take the grasses of the grave,<br/>
And make them pipes whereon to blow.
</p>
<p>
The traveller hears me now and then,<br/>
And sometimes harshly will he speak:<br/>
'This fellow would make weakness weak,<br/>
And melt the waxen hearts of men.'
</p>
<p>
Another answers, 'Let him be,<br/>
He loves to make parade of pain<br/>
That with his piping he may gain<br/>
The praise that comes to constancy.'
</p>
<p>
A third is wroth: 'Is this an hour<br/>
For private sorrow's barren song,<br/>
When more and more the people throng<br/>
The chairs and thrones of civil power?
</p>
<p>
'A time to sicken and to swoon,<br/>
When Science reaches forth her arms<br/>
To feel from world to world, and charms<br/>
Her secret from the latest moon?'
</p>
<p>
Behold, ye speak an idle thing:<br/>
Ye never knew the sacred dust:<br/>
I do but sing because I must,<br/>
And pipe but as the linnets sing:
</p>
<p>
And one is glad; her note is gay,<br/>
For now her little ones have ranged;<br/>
And one is sad; her note is changed,<br/>
Because her brood is stol'n away.

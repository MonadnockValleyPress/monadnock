<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>XL</h3>
<p>
Could we forget the widow'd hour<br/>
And look on Spirits breathed away,<br/>
As on a maiden in the day<br/>
When first she wears her orange-flower!
</p>
<p>
When crown'd with blessing she doth rise<br/>
To take her latest leave of home,<br/>
And hopes and light regrets that come<br/>
Make April of her tender eyes;
</p>
<p>
And doubtful joys the father move,<br/>
And tears are on the mother's face,<br/>
As parting with a long embrace<br/>
She enters other realms of love;
</p>
<p>
Her office there to rear, to teach,<br/>
Becoming as is meet and fit<br/>
A link among the days, to knit<br/>
The generations each with each;
</p>
<p>
And, doubtless, unto thee is given<br/>
A life that bears immortal fruit<br/>
In those great offices that suit<br/>
The full-grown energies of heaven.
</p>
<p>
Ay me, the difference I discern!<br/>
How often shall her old fireside<br/>
Be cheer'd with tidings of the bride,<br/>
How often she herself return,
</p>
<p>
And tell them all they would have told,<br/>
And bring her babe, and make her boast,<br/>
Till even those that miss'd her most<br/>
Shall count new things as dear as old:
</p>
<p>
But thou and I have shaken hands,<br/>
Till growing winters lay me low;<br/>
My paths are in the fields I know.<br/>
And thine in undiscover'd lands.

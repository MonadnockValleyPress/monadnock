<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>LXXII</h3>
<p>
Risest thou thus, dim dawn, again,<br/>
And howlest, issuing out of night,<br/>
With blasts that blow the poplar white,<br/>
And lash with storm the streaming pane?
</p>
<p>
Day, when my crown'd estate begun<br/>
To pine in that reverse of doom,<br/>
Which sicken'd every living bloom,<br/>
And blurr'd the splendour of the sun;
</p>
<p>
Who usherest in the dolorous hour<br/>
With thy quick tears that make the rose<br/>
Pull sideways, and the daisy close<br/>
Her crimson fringes to the shower;
</p>
<p>
Who might'st have heaved a windless flame<br/>
Up the deep East, or, whispering, play'd<br/>
A chequer-work of beam and shade<br/>
Along the hills, yet look'd the same.
</p>
<p>
As wan, as chill, as wild as now;<br/>
Day, mark'd as with some hideous crime,<br/>
When the dark hand struck down thro' time,<br/>
And cancell'd nature's best: but thou,
</p>
<p>
Lift as thou may'st thy burthen'd brows<br/>
Thro' clouds that drench the morning star,<br/>
And whirl the ungarner'd sheaf afar,<br/>
And sow the sky with flying boughs,
</p>
<p>
And up thy vault with roaring sound<br/>
Climb thy thick noon, disastrous day;<br/>
Touch thy dull goal of joyless gray,<br/>
And hide thy shame beneath the ground.

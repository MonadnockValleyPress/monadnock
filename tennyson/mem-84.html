<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>LXXXIV</h3>
<p>
When I contemplate all alone<br/>
The life that had been thine below,<br/>
And fix my thoughts on all the glow<br/>
To which thy crescent would have grown;
</p>
<p>
I see thee sitting crown'd with good,<br/>
A central warmth diffusing bliss<br/>
In glance and smile, and clasp and kiss,<br/>
On all the branches of thy blood;
</p>
<p>
Thy blood, my friend, and partly mine;<br/>
For now the day was drawing on,<br/>
When thou should'st link thy life with one<br/>
Of mine own house, and boys of thine
</p>
<p>
Had babbled 'Uncle' on my knee;<br/>
But that remorseless iron hour<br/>
Made cypress of her orange flower,<br/>
Despair of Hope, and earth of thee.
</p>
<p>
I seem to meet their least desire,<br/>
To clap their cheeks, to call them mine.<br/>
I see their unborn faces shine<br/>
Beside the never-lighted fire.
</p>
<p>
I see myself an honor'd guest,<br/>
Thy partner in the flowery walk<br/>
Of letters, genial table-talk,<br/>
Or deep dispute, and graceful jest;
</p>
<p>
While now thy prosperous labor fills<br/>
The lips of men with honest praise,<br/>
And sun by sun the happy days<br/>
Descend below the golden hills
</p>
<p>
With promise of a morn as fair;<br/>
And all the train of bounteous hours<br/>
Conduct by paths of growing powers,<br/>
To reverence and the silver hair;
</p>
<p>
Till slowly worn her earthly robe,<br/>
Her lavish mission richly wrought,<br/>
Leaving great legacies of thought,<br/>
Thy spirit should fail from off the globe;
</p>
<p>
What time mine own might also flee,<br/>
As link'd with thine in love and fate,<br/>
And, hovering o'er the dolorous strait<br/>
To the other shore, involved in thee,
</p>
<p>
Arrive at last the blessed goal,<br/>
And He that died in Holy Land<br/>
Would reach us out the shining hand,<br/>
And take us as a single soul.
</p>
<p>
What reed was that on which I leant?<br/>
Ah, backward fancy, wherefore wake<br/>
The old bitterness again, and break<br/>
The low beginnings of content.

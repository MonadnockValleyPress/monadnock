<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>XLVIII</h3>
<p>
If these brief lays, of Sorrow born,<br/>
Were taken to be such as closed<br/>
Grave doubts and answers here proposed,<br/>
Then these were such as men might scorn:
</p>
<p>
Her care is not to part and prove;<br/>
She takes, when harsher moods remit,<br/>
What slender shade of doubt may flit,<br/>
And makes it vassal unto love:
</p>
<p>
And hence, indeed, she sports with words,<br/>
But better serves a wholesome law,<br/>
And holds it sin and shame to draw<br/>
The deepest measure from the chords:
</p>
<p>
Nor dare she trust a larger lay,<br/>
But rather loosens from the lip<br/>
Short swallow-flights of song, that dip<br/>
Their wings in tears, and skim away.
</p>

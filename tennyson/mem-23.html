<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>XXIII</h3>
<p>
Now, sometimes in my sorrow shut,<br/>
Or breaking into song by fits,<br/>
Alone, alone, to where he sits,<br/>
The Shadow cloak'd from head to foot,
</p>
<p>
Who keeps the keys of all the creeds,<br/>
I wander, often falling lame,<br/>
And looking back to whence I came,<br/>
Or on to where the pathway leads;
</p>
<p>
And crying, How changed from where it ran<br/>
Thro' lands where not a leaf was dumb;<br/>
But all the lavish hills would hum<br/>
The murmur of a happy Pan:
</p>
<p>
When each by turns was guide to each,<br/>
And Fancy light from Fancy caught,<br/>
And Thought leapt out to wed with Thought<br/>
Ere Thought could wed itself with Speech;
</p>
<p>
And all we met was fair and good,<br/>
And all was good that Time could bring,<br/>
And all the secret of the Spring<br/>
Moved in the chambers of the blood;
</p>
<p>
And many an old philosophy<br/>
On Argive heights divinely sang,<br/>
And round us all the thicket rang<br/>
To many a flute of Arcady.

<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>
One writes, that 'Other friends remain,'<br/>
That 'Loss is common to the race'?<br/>
And common is the commonplace,<br/>
And vacant chaff well meant for grain.
</p>
<p>
That loss is common would not make<br/>
My own less bitter, rather more:<br/>
Too common! Never morning wore<br/>
To evening, but some heart did break.
</p>
<p>
O father, wheresoe'er thou be,<br/>
Who pledgest now thy gallant son;<br/>
A shot, ere half thy draught be done,<br/>
Hath still'd the life that beat from thee.
</p>
<p>
O mother, praying God will save<br/>
Thy sailor,&mdash;while thy head is bow'd,<br/>
His heavy-shotted hammock-shroud<br/>
Drops in his vast and wandering grave.
</p>
<p>
Ye know no more than I who wrought<br/>
At that last hour to please him well;<br/>
Who mused on all I had to tell,<br/>
And something written, something thought;
</p>
<p>
Expecting still his advent home;<br/>
And ever met him on his way<br/>
With wishes, thinking, 'here to-day,'<br/>
Or 'here to-morrow will he come.'
</p>
<p>
O somewhere, meek, unconscious dove,<br/>
That sittest ranging golden hair;<br/>
And glad to find thyself so fair,<br/>
Poor child, that waitest for thy love!
</p>
<p>
For now her father's chimney glows<br/>
In expectation of a guest;<br/>
And thinking 'this will please him best,'<br/>
She takes a riband or a rose;
</p>
<p>
For he will see them on to-night;<br/>
And with the thought her colour burns;<br/>
And, having left the glass, she turns<br/>
Once more to set a ringlet right;
</p>
<p>
And, even when she turn'd, the curse<br/>
Had fallen, and her future Lord<br/>
Was drown'd in passing thro' the ford,<br/>
Or kill'd in falling from his horse.
</p>
<p>
O what to her shall be the end?<br/>
And what to me remains of good?<br/>
To her, perpetual maidenhood,<br/>
And unto me no second friend.

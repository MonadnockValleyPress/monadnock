<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>XXXI</h3>
<p>
When Lazarus left his charnel-cave,<br/>
And home to Mary's house return'd,<br/>
Was this demanded&mdash;if he yearn'd<br/>
To hear her weeping by his grave?
</p>
<p>
'Where wert thou, brother, those four days?'<br/>
There lives no record of reply,<br/>
Which telling what it is to die<br/>
Had surely added praise to praise.
</p>
<p>
From every house the neighbours met,<br/>
The streets were fill'd with joyful sound,<br/>
A solemn gladness even crown'd<br/>
The purple brows of Olivet.
</p>
<p>
Behold a man raised up by Christ!<br/>
The rest remaineth unreveal'd;<br/>
He told it not; or something seal'd<br/>
The lips of that Evangelist.

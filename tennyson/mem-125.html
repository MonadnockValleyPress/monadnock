<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>CXXV</h3>
<p>
Whatever I have said or sung,<br/>
Some bitter notes my harp would give,<br/>
Yea, tho' there often seem'd to live<br/>
A contradiction on the tongue,
</p>
<p>
Yet Hope had never lost her youth,<br/>
She did but look through dimmer eyes;<br/>
Or Love but play'd with gracious lies,<br/>
Because he felt so fix'd in truth;
</p>
<p>
And if the song were full of care,<br/>
He breathed the spirit of the song;<br/>
And if the words were sweet and strong<br/>
He set his royal signet there;
</p>
<p>
Abiding with me till I sail<br/>
To seek thee on the mystic deeps,<br/>
And this electric force, that keeps<br/>
A thousand pulses dancing, fail.

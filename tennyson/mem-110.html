<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>CX</h3>
<p>
Thy converse drew us with delight,<br/>
The men of rathe and riper years:<br/>
The feeble soul, a haunt of fears,<br/>
Forgot his weakness in thy sight.
</p>
<p>
On thee the loyal-hearted hung,<br/>
The proud was half disarm'd of pride,<br/>
Nor cared the serpent at thy side<br/>
To flicker with his double tongue.
</p>
<p>
The stern were mild when thou wert by,<br/>
The flippant put himself to school<br/>
And heard thee, and the brazen fool<br/>
Was soften'd, and he knew not why;
</p>
<p>
While I, thy nearest, sat apart,<br/>
And felt thy triumph was as mine;<br/>
And loved them more, that they were thine,<br/>
The graceful tact, the Christian art;
</p>
<p>
Nor mine the sweetness or the skill,<br/>
But mine the love that will not tire,<br/>
And, born of love, the vague desire<br/>
That spurs an imitative will.

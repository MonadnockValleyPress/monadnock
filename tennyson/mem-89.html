<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>LXXXIX</h3>
<p>
Witch-elms that counterchange the floor<br/>
Of this flat lawn with dusk and bright;<br/>
And thou, with all thy breadth and height<br/>
Of foliage, towering sycamore;
</p>
<p>
How often, hither wandering down,<br/>
My Arthur found your shadows fair,<br/>
And shook to all the liberal air<br/>
The dust and din and steam of town:
</p>
<p>
He brought an eye for all he saw;<br/>
He mixt in all our simple sports;<br/>
They pleased him, fresh from brawling courts<br/>
And dusty purlieus of the law.
</p>
<p>
O joy to him in this retreat,<br/>
Inmantled in ambrosial dark,<br/>
To drink the cooler air, and mark<br/>
The landscape winking thro' the heat:
</p>
<p>
O sound to rout the brood of cares,<br/>
The sweep of scythe in morning dew,<br/>
The gust that round the garden flew,<br/>
And tumbled half the mellowing pears!
</p>
<p>
O bliss, when all in circle drawn<br/>
About him, heart and ear were fed<br/>
To hear him, as he lay and read<br/>
The Tuscan poets on the lawn:
</p>
<p>
Or in the all-golden afternoon<br/>
A guest, or happy sister, sung,<br/>
Or here she brought the harp and flung<br/>
A ballad to the brightening moon:
</p>
<p>
Nor less it pleased in livelier moods,<br/>
Beyond the bounding hill to stray,<br/>
And break the livelong summer day<br/>
With banquet in the distant woods;
</p>
<p>
Whereat we glanced from theme to theme,<br/>
Discuss'd the books to love or hate,<br/>
Or touch'd the changes of the state,<br/>
Or threaded some Socratic dream;
</p>
<p>
But if I praised the busy town,<br/>
He loved to rail against it still,<br/>
For 'ground in yonder social mill<br/>
We rub each other's angles down,
</p>
<p>
'And merge,' he said, 'in form and gloss<br/>
The picturesque of man and man.'<br/>
We talk'd: the stream beneath us ran,<br/>
The wine-flask lying couch'd in moss,
</p>
<p>
Or cool'd within the glooming wave;<br/>
And last, returning from afar,<br/>
Before the crimson-circled star<br/>
Had fall'n into her father's grave,
</p>
<p>
And brushing ankle-deep in flowers,<br/>
We heard behind the woodbine veil<br/>
The milk that bubbled in the pail,<br/>
And buzzings of the honied hours.

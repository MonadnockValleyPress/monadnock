<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>CXI</h3>
<p>
The churl in spirit, up or down<br/>
Along the scale of ranks, thro' all,<br/>
To him who grasps a golden ball,<br/>
By blood a king, at heart a clown;
</p>
<p>
The churl in spirit, howe'er he veil<br/>
His want in forms for fashion's sake,<br/>
Will let his coltish nature break<br/>
At seasons thro' the gilded pale:
</p>
<p>
For who can always act? but he,<br/>
To whom a thousand memories call,<br/>
Not being less but more than all<br/>
The gentleness he seem'd to be,
</p>
<p>
Best seem'd the thing he was, and join'd<br/>
Each office of the social hour<br/>
To noble manners, as the flower<br/>
And native growth of noble mind;
</p>
<p>
Nor ever narrowness or spite,<br/>
Or villain fancy fleeting by,<br/>
Drew in the expression of an eye,<br/>
Where God and Nature met in light;
</p>
<p>
And thus he bore without abuse<br/>
The grand old name of gentleman,<br/>
Defamed by every charlatan,<br/>
And soil'd with all ignoble use.

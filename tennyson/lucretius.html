<h1>Lucretius</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<p>
Lucilla, wedded to Lucretius, found<br/>
Her master cold; for when the morning flush<br/>
Of passion and the first embrace had died<br/>
Between them, tho' he loved her none the less,<br/>
Yet often when the woman heard his foot<br/>
Return from pacings in the field, and ran<br/>
To greet him with a kiss, the master took<br/>
Small notice, or austerely, for his mind<br/>
Half buried in some weightier argument,<br/>
Or fancy-borne perhaps upon the rise<br/>
And long roll of the hexameter &#151; he past<br/>
To turn and ponder those three hundred scrolls<br/>
Left by the Teacher, whom he held divine.<br/>
She brook'd it not, but wrathful, petulant<br/>
Dreaming some rival, sought and found a witch<br/>
Who brew'd the philtre which had power, they said<br/>
To lead an errant passion home again.<br/>
And this, at times, she mingled with his drink,<br/>
And this destroy'd him; for the wicked broth<br/>
Confused the chemic labor of the blood,<br/>
And tickling the brute brain within the man's<br/>
Made havoc among those tender cells, and check'd<br/>
His power to shape. He loathed himself, and once<br/>
After a tempest woke upon a morn<br/>
That mock'd him with returning calm, and cried:
</p>
<p>
"Storm in the night! for thrice I heard the rain
Rushing; and once the flash of a thunderbolt &#151;<br/>
Methought I never saw so fierce a fork &#151;<br/>
Struck out the streaming mountain-side, and show'd<br/>
A riotous confluence of watercourses<br/>
Blanching and billowing in a hollow of it,<br/>
Where all but yester-eve was dusty-dry.
</p>
<p>
"Storm, and what dreams, ye holy Gods, what dreams!<br/>
For thrice I waken'd after dreams. Perchance<br/>
We do but recollect the dreams that come<br/>
Just ere the waking. Terrible: for it seem'd<br/>
A void was made in Nature, all her bonds<br/>
Crack'd; and I saw the flaring atom-streams<br/>
And torrents of her myriad universe,<br/>
Ruining along the illimitable inane,<br/>
Fly on to clash together again, and make<br/>
Another and another frame of things<br/>
For ever. That was mine, my dream, I knew it &#151;<br/>
Of and belonging to me, as the dog<br/>
With inward yelp and restless forefoot plies<br/>
His function of the woodland; but the next!<br/>
I thought that all the blood by Sylla shed<br/>
Came driving rainlike down again on earth,<br/>
And where it dash'd the reddening meadow, sprang<br/>
No dragon warriors from Cadmean teeth,<br/>
For these I thought my dream would show to me,<br/>
But girls, Hetairai, curious in their art,<br/>
Hired animalisms, vile as those that made<br/>
The mulberry-faced Dictator's orgies worse<br/>
Than aught they fable of the quiet Gods.<br/>
And hands they mixt, and yell'd and round me drove<br/>
In narrowing circles till I yell'd again<br/>
Half-suffocated, and sprang up, and saw &#151;<br/>
Was it the first beam of my latest day?
</p>
<p>
"Then, then, from utter gloom stood out the<br/>
The breasts of Helen, and hoveringly a sword<br/>
Now over and now under, now direct,<br/>
Pointed itself to pierce, but sank down shamed<br/>
At all that beauty; and as I stared, a fire,<br/>
The fire that left a roofless Ilion,<br/>
Shot out of them, and scorch'd me that I woke.
</p>
<p>
"Is this thy vengeance, holy Venus, thine,<br/>
Because I would not one of thine own doves,<br/>
Not even a rose, were offered to thee? thine,<br/>
Forgetful how my rich proemion makes<br/>
Thy glory fly along the Italian field,<br/>
In lays that will outlast thy deity?
</p>
<p>
"Deity? nay, thy worshippers. My tongue<br/>
Trips, or I speak profanely. Which of these<br/>
Angers thee most, or angers thee at all?<br/>
Not if thou be'st of those who, far aloof<br/>
From envy, hate and pity, and spite and scorn,<br/>
Live the great life which all our greatest fain<br/>
Would follow, centred in eternal calm.
</p>
<p>
"Nay, if thou canst,<br/>
Goddess, like ourselves<br/>
Touch, and be touch'd, then would I cry to thee<br/>
To kiss thy Mavors, roll thy tender arms<br/>
Round him, and keep him from the lust of blood<br/>
That makes a steaming slaughter-house of Rome.
</p>
<p>
"Ay, but I meant not thee; I meant riot her<br/>
Whom all the pines of Ida shook to see<br/>
Slide from that quiet heaven of hers, and tempt<br/>
The Trojan, while his neatherds were abroad<br/>
Nor her that o'er her wounded hunter wept<br/>
Her deity false in human-amorous tears;<br/>
Nor whom her beardless apple-arbiter<br/>
Decided fairest. Rather, O ye Gods,<br/>
Poet-like, as the great Sicilian called<br/>
Calliope to grace his golden verse &#151;<br/>
Ay, and this Kypris also &#151; did I take<br/>
That popular name of thine to shadow forth<br/>
The all-generating powers and genial heat<br/>
Of Nature, when she strikes thro' the thick blood<br/>
Of cattle, and light is large, and lambs are glad<br/>
Nosing the mother's udder, and the bird<br/>
Makes his heart voice amid the blaze of flowers;<br/>
Which things appear the work of mighty Gods.
</p>
<p>
"The Gods! and if I go my work is left<br/>
Unfinish'd &#151; if I go. The Gods, who haunt<br/>
The lucid interspace of world and world,<br/>
Where never creeps a cloud, or moves a wind,<br/>
Nor ever falls the least white star of mow<br/>
Nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans,<br/>
Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar<br/>
Their sacred everlasting calm! and such,<br/>
Not all so fine, nor so divine a calm<br/>
Not such, nor all unlike it, man may gain<br/>
Letting his own life go. The Gods, the Godsl<br/>
If all be atoms, how then should the Gods<br/>
Being atomic not be dissoluble,<br/>
Not follow the great law? My master held<br/>
That Gods there are, for all men so believe.<br/>
I prest my footsteps into his, and meant<br/>
Surely to lead my Memmius in a train<br/>
Of fiowery clauses onward to the proof<br/>
That Gods there are, and deathless. Meant? I meant?<br/>
I have forgotten what I meant, my mind<br/>
Stumbles, and all my faculties are lamed.
</p>
<p>
"Look where another of our Gods, the Sun<br/>
Apollo, Delius, or of older use<br/>
All-seeing Hyperion &#151; what you will &#151;<br/>
Has mounted yonder; since he never sware,<br/>
Except his wrath were wreak'd on wretched man,<br/>
That he would only shine among the dead<br/>
Hereafter &#151; tales! for never yet on earth<br/>
Could dead flesh creep, or bits of roasting ox<br/>
Moan round the spit &#151; nor knows he what he sees;<br/>
King of the East altho' he seem, and girt<br/>
With song and flame and fragrance, slowly lifts<br/>
His golden feet on those empurpled stairs<br/>
That climb into the windy halls of heaven<br/>
And here he glances on an eye new-born,<br/>
And gets for greeting but a wail of pain;<br/>
And here he stays upon a freezing orb<br/>
That fain would gaze upon him to the last;<br/>
And here upon a yellow eyelid fallen<br/>
And closed by those who mourn a friend in vain,<br/>
Not thankful that his troubles are no more.<br/>
And me, altho' his fire is on my face<br/>
Blinding, he sees not, nor at all can tell<br/>
Whether I mean this day to end myself.<br/>
Or lend an ear to Plato where he says,<br/>
That men like soldiers may not quit the post<br/>
Allotted by the Gods. But he that holds<br/>
The Gods are careless, wherefore need he care<br/>
Greatly for them, nor rather plunge at once,<br/>
Being troubled, wholly out of sight, and sink<br/>
Past earthquake &#151; ay, and gout and stone, that break<br/>
Body toward death, and palsy, death-in-life,<br/>
And wretched age &#151; and worst disease of all,<br/>
These prodigies of myriad nakednesses,<br/>
And twisted shapes of lust, unspeakable,<br/>
Abominable, strangers at my hearth<br/>
Not welcome, harpies miring every dish,<br/>
The phantom husks of something foully done,<br/>
And fleeting thro' the boundless universe,<br/>
And blasting the long quiet of my breast<br/>
With animal heat and dire insanity?
</p>
<p>
"How should the mind, except it loved them, clasp<br/>
These idols to herself? or do they fly<br/>
Now thinner, and now thicker, like the flakes<br/>
In a fall of snow, and so press in, perforce<br/>
Of multitude, as crowds that in an hour<br/>
Of civic tumult jam the doors, and bear<br/>
The keepers down, and throng, their rags and the<br/>
The basest, far into that council-hall<br/>
Where sit the best and stateliest of the land?
</p>
<p>
"Can I not fling this horror off me again,<br/>
Seeing with how great ease Nature can smile<br/>
Balmier and nobler from her bath of storm,<br/>
At random ravage? and how easily<br/>
The mountain there has cast his cloudy slough,<br/>
Now towering o'er him in serenest air,<br/>
A mountain o'er a mountain, &#151; ay, and within<br/>
All hollow as the hopes and fears of men?
</p>
<p>
"But who was he that in the garden snared<br/>
Picus and Faunus, rustic Gods? a tale<br/>
To laugh at &#151; more to laugh at in myself &#151;<br/>
For look! what is it? there? yon arbutus<br/>
Totters; a noiseless riot underneath<br/>
Strikes through the wood, sets all the tops quivering &#151;;<br/>
The mountain quickens into Nymph and Faun,<br/>
And here an Oread &#151; how the sun delights<br/>
To glance and shift about her slippery sides,<br/>
And rosy knees and supple roundedness,<br/>
And budded bosom-peaks &#151; who this way runs<br/>
Before the rest! &#151; a satyr, a satyr, see,<br/>
Follows; but him I proved impossible<br/>
Two-natured is no nature. Yet he draws<br/>
Nearer and nearer, and I scan him now<br/>
Beastlier than any phantom of his kind<br/>
That ever butted his rough brother-brute<br/>
For lust or lusty blood or provender.<br/>
I hate, abhor, spit, sicken at him; and she<br/>
Loathes him as well; such a precipitate heel,<br/>
Fledged as it were with Mercury's ankle-wing,<br/>
Whirls her to me &#151;; but will she fling herself<br/>
Shameless upon me? Catch her, goatfoot! nay,<br/>
Hide, hide them, million-myrtled wilderness,
</p>
<p>
And cavern-shadowing laurels, hide! do I wish &#151;<br/>
What? &#151;; that the bush were leafless? or to whelm<br/>
All of them in one massacre? O ye Gods<br/>
I know you careless, yet, behold, to you<br/>
From childly wont and ancient use I call &#151;<br/>
I thought I lived securely as yourselves &#151;<br/>
No lewdness, narrowing envy, monkey-spite,<br/>
No madness of ambition, avarice, none;<br/>
No larger feast than under plane or pine<br/>
With neighbors laid along the grass, to take<br/>
Only such cups as left us friendly-warm,<br/>
Affirming each his own philosophy<br/>
Nothing to mar the sober majesties<br/>
Of settled, sweet, Epicurean life.<br/>
But now it seems some unseen monster lays<br/>
His vast and filthy hands upon my will,<br/>
Wrenching it backward into his, and spoils<br/>
My bliss in being; and it was not great,<br/>
For save when shutting reasons up in rhythm,<br/>
Or Heliconian honey in living words,<br/>
To make a truth less harsh, I often grew<br/>
Tired of so much within our little life<br/>
Or of so little in our little life &#151;<br/>
Poor little life that toddles half an hour<br/>
Crown'd with a flower or two, and there an end &#151;<br/>
And since the nobler pleasure seems to fade,<br/>
Why should I, beastlike as I find myself,<br/>
Not manlike end myself? &#151; our privilege &#151;;<br/>
What beast has heart to do it? And what man<br/>
What Roman would be dragg'd in triumph thus?<br/>
Not I; not he, who bears one name with her<br/>
Whose death-blow struck the dateless doom of kings,<br/>
When, brooking not the Tarquin in her veins,<br/>
She made her blood in sight of Collatine<br/>
And all his peers, flushing the guiltless air,<br/>
Spout from the maiden fountain in her heart.<br/>
And from it sprang the Commonwealth, which breaks<br/>
As I am breaking now!
</p>
<p>
"And therefore now<br/>
Let her, that is the womb and tomb of all<br/>
Great Nature, take, and forcing far apart<br/>
Those blind beginnings that have made me man,<br/>
Dash them anew together at her will<br/>
Thro' all her cycles &#151; into man once more,<br/>
Or beast or bird or fish, or opulent flower.<br/>
But till this cosmic order everywhere<br/>
Shatter'd into one earthquake in one day<br/>
Cracks all to pieces, &#151; and that hour perhaps<br/>
Is not so far when momentary man<br/>
Shall seem no more a something to himself,<br/>
But he, his hopes and hates, his homes and fanes<br/>
And even his bones long laid within the grave,<br/>
The very sides of the grave itself shall pass,<br/>
Vanishing, atom and void, atom and void,<br/>
Into the unseen for ever, &#151; till that hour,<br/>
My golden work in which I told a truth<br/>
That stays the rolling Ixionian wheel,<br/>
And numbs the Fury's ringlet-snake, and plucks<br/>
The mortal soul from out immortal hell<br/>
Shall stand. Ay, surely; then it fails at last<br/>
And perishes as I must, for O Thou<br/>
Passionless bride, divine Tranquillity,<br/>
Yearn'd after by the wisest of the wise<br/>
Who fail to find thee, being as thou art<br/>
Without one pleasure and without one pain,<br/>
Howbeit I know thou surely must be mine<br/>
Or soon or late, yet out of season, thus<br/>
I woo thee roughly, for thou carest not<br/>
How roughly men may woo thee so they win &#151;;<br/>
Thus &#151; thus &#151; the soul flies out and dies in the air."
</p>
<p>
With that he drove the knife into his side.<br/>
She heard him raging, heard him fall, ran in,<br/>
Beat breast, tore hair, cried out upon herself<br/>
As having fail'd in duty to him, shriek'd<br/>
That she but meant to win him back, fell on him<br/>
Clasp'd, kiss'd him, wail'd. He answer'd, "Care not thou!<br/>
Thy duty? What is duty? Fare thee well!"

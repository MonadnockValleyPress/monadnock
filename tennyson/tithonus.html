<h1>Tithonus</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson (1833)</h2>
<p>
The woods decay, the woods decay and fall,<br/>
The vapours weep their burthen to the ground,<br/>
Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath,<br/>
And after many a summer dies the swan.<br/>
Me only cruel immortality<br/>
Consumes; I wither slowly in thine arms,<br/>
Here at the quiet limit of the world,<br/>
A white-hair'd shadow roaming like a dream<br/>
The ever-silent spaces of the East,<br/>
Far-folded mists, and gleaming halls of morn.<br/>
Alas! for this gray shadow, once a manâ€”<br/>
So glorious in his beauty and thy choice,<br/>
Who madest him thy chosen, that he seem'd<br/>
To his great heart none other than a God!<br/>
I ask'd thee, "Give me immortality."<br/>
Then didst thou grant mine asking with a smile,<br/>
Like wealthy men who care not how they give.<br/>
But thy strong Hours indignant work'd their wills,<br/>
And beat me down and marr'd and wasted me,<br/>
And tho' they could not end me left me maim'd<br/>
To dwell in presence of immortal youth,<br/>
Immortal age beside immortal youth,<br/>
And all I was in ashes. Can thy love<br/>
Thy beauty, make amends, tho' even now,<br/>
Close over us, the silver star, thy guide,<br/>
Shines in those tremulous eyes that fill with tears<br/>
To hear me? Let me go: take back thy gift:<br/>
Why should a man desire in any way<br/>
To vary from the kindly race of men,<br/>
Or pass beyond the goal of ordinance<br/>
Where all should pause, as if most meet for all?
</p>
<p>
A soft air fans the cloud apart; there comes<br/>
A glimpse of that dark world where I was born.<br/>
Once more the old mysterious glimmer steals<br/>
From any pure brows, and from thy shoulders pure,<br/>
And bosom beating with a heart renew'd.<br/>
Thy cheek begins to redden thro' the gloom,<br/>
Thy sweet eyes brighten slowly close to mine,<br/>
Ere yet they blind the stars, and the wild team<br/>
Which love thee, yearning for thy yoke, arise,<br/>
And shake the darkness from their loosen'd manes,<br/>
And beat the twilight into flakes of fire.<br/>
Lo! ever thus thou growest beautiful<br/>
In silence, then before thine answer given<br/>
Departest, and thy tears are on my cheek.
</p>
<p>
Why wilt thou ever scare me with thy tears,<br/>
And make me tremble lest a saying learnt,<br/>
In days far-off, on that dark earth, be true?<br/>
"The Gods themselves cannot recall their gifts."
</p>
<p>
Ay me! ay me! with what another heart<br/>
In days far-off, and with what other eyes<br/>
I used to watch (if I be he that watch'd)<br/>
The lucid outline forming round thee; saw<br/>
The dim curls kindle into sunny rings;<br/>
Changed with thy mystic change, and felt my blood<br/>
Glow with the glow that slowly crimson'd all<br/>
Thy presence and thy portals, while I lay,<br/>
Mouth, forehead, eyelids, growing dewy-warm<br/>
With kisses balmier than half-opening buds<br/>
Of April, and could hear the lips that kiss'd<br/>
Whispering I knew not what of wild and sweet,<br/>
Like that strange song I heard Apollo sing,<br/>
While Ilion like a mist rose into towers.
</p>
<p>
Yet hold me not for ever in thine East;<br/>
How can my nature longer mix with thine?<br/>
Coldly thy rosy shadows bathe me, cold<br/>
Are all thy lights, and cold my wrinkled feet<br/>
Upon thy glimmering thresholds, when the steam<br/>
Floats up from those dim fields about the homes<br/>
Of happy men that have the power to die,<br/>
And grassy barrows of the happier dead.<br/>
Release me, and restore me to the ground;<br/>
Thou seest all things, thou wilt see my grave:<br/>
Thou wilt renew thy beauty morn by morn;<br/>
I earth in earth forget these empty courts,<br/>
And thee returning on thy silver wheels.

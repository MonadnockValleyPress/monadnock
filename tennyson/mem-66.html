<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>LXVI</h3>
<p>
You thought my heart too far diseased;<br/>
You wonder when my fancies play<br/>
To find me gay among the gay,<br/>
Like one with any trifle pleased.
</p>
<p>
The shade by which my life was crost,<br/>
Which makes a desert in the mind,<br/>
Has made me kindly with my kind,<br/>
And like to him whose sight is lost;
</p>
<p>
Whose feet are guided thro' the land,<br/>
Whose jest among his friends is free,<br/>
Who takes the children on his knee,<br/>
And winds their curls about his hand:
</p>
<p>
He plays with threads, he beats his chair<br/>
For pastime, dreaming of the sky;<br/>
His inner day can never die,<br/>
His night of loss is always there.
</p>

<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>XXX</h3>
<p>
With trembling fingers did we weave<br/>
The holly round the Chrismas hearth;<br/>
A rainy cloud possess'd the earth,<br/>
And sadly fell our Christmas-eve.
</p>
<p>
At our old pastimes in the hall<br/>
We gambol'd, making vain pretence<br/>
Of gladness, with an awful sense<br/>
Of one mute Shadow watching all.
</p>
<p>
We paused: the winds were in the beech:<br/>
We heard them sweep the winter land;<br/>
And in a circle hand-in-hand<br/>
Sat silent, looking each at each.
</p>
<p>
Then echo-like our voices rang;<br/>
We sung, tho' every eye was dim,<br/>
A merry song we sang with him<br/>
Last year: impetuously we sang:
</p>
<p>
We ceased:a gentler feeling crept<br/>
Upon us: surely rest is meet:<br/>
'They rest,' we said, 'their sleep is sweet,'<br/>
And silence follow'd, and we wept.
</p>
<p>
Our voices took a higher range;<br/>
Once more we sang: 'They do not die<br/>
Nor lose their mortal sympathy,<br/>
Nor change to us, although they change;
</p>
<p>
'Rapt from the fickle and the frail<br/>
With gather'd power, yet the same,<br/>
Pierces the keen seraphic flame<br/>
From orb to orb, from veil to veil.'
</p>
<p>
Rise, happy morn, rise, holy morn,<br/>
Draw forth the cheerful day from night:<br/>
O Father, touch the east, and light<br/>
The light that shone when Hope was born.

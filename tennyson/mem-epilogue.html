<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>Epilogue</h3>
<p>
O true and tried, so well and long,<br/>
Demand not thou a marriage lay;<br/>
In that it is thy marriage day<br/>
Is music more than any song.
</p>
<p>
Nor have I felt so much of bliss<br/>
Since first he told me that he loved<br/>
A daughter of our house, nor proved<br/>
Since that dark day a day like this;
</p>
<p>
Tho' I since then have number'd o'er<br/>
Some thrice three years: they went and came,<br/>
Remade the blood and changed the frame,<br/>
And yet is love not less, but more;
</p>
<p>
No longer caring to embalm<br/>
In dying songs a dead regret,<br/>
But like a statue solid-set,<br/>
And moulded in colossal calm.
</p>
<p>
Regret is dead, but love is more<br/>
Than in the summers that are flown,<br/>
For I myself with these have grown<br/>
To something greater than before;
</p>
<p>
Which makes appear the songs I made<br/>
As echoes out of weaker times,<br/>
As half but idle brawling rhymes,<br/>
The sport of random sun and shade.
</p>
<p>
But where is she, the bridal flower,<br/>
That must be made a wife ere noon?<br/>
She enters, glowing like the moon<br/>
Of Eden on its bridal bower:
</p>
<p>
On me she bends her blissful eyes<br/>
And then on thee; they meet thy look<br/>
And brighten like the star that shook<br/>
Betwixt the palms of paradise.
</p>
<p>
O when her life was yet in bud,<br/>
He too foretold the perfect rose.<br/>
For thee she grew, for thee she grows<br/>
For ever, and as fair as good.
</p>
<p>
And thou art worthy; full of power;<br/>
As gentle; liberal-minded, great,<br/>
Consistent; wearing all that weight<br/>
Of learning lightly like a flower.
</p>
<p>
But now set out: the noon is near,<br/>
And I must give away the bride;<br/>
She fears not, or with thee beside<br/>
And me behind her, will not fear.
</p>
<p>
For I that danced her on my knee,<br/>
That watch'd her on her nurse's arm,<br/>
That shielded all her life from harm<br/>
At last must part with her to thee;
</p>
<p>
Now waiting to be made a wife,<br/>
Her feet, my darling, on the dead<br/>
Their pensive tablets round her head,<br/>
And the most living words of life
</p>
<p>
Breathed in her ear. The ring is on,<br/>
The 'wilt thou' answer'd, and again<br/>
The 'wilt thou' ask'd, till out of twain<br/>
Her sweet 'I will' has made you one.
</p>
<p>
Now sign your names, which shall be read,<br/>
Mute symbols of a joyful morn,<br/>
By village eyes as yet unborn;<br/>
The names are sign'd, and overhead
</p>
<p>
Begins the clash and clang that tells<br/>
The joy to every wandering breeze;<br/>
The blind wall rocks, and on the trees<br/>
The dead leaf trembles to the bells.
</p>
<p>
O happy hour, and happier hours<br/>
Await them. Many a merry face<br/>
Salutes them&mdash;maidens of the place,<br/>
That pelt us in the porch with flowers.
</p>
<p>
O happy hour, behold the bride<br/>
With him to whom her hand I gave.<br/>
They leave the porch, they pass the grave<br/>
That has to-day its sunny side.
</p>
<p>
To-day the grave is bright for me,<br/>
For them the light of life increased,<br/>
Who stay to share the morning feast,<br/>
Who rest to-night beside the sea.
</p>
<p>
Let all my genial spirits advance<br/>
To meet and greet a whiter sun;<br/>
My drooping memory will not shun<br/>
The foaming grape of eastern France.
</p>
<p>
It circles round, and fancy plays,<br/>
And hearts are warm'd and faces bloom,<br/>
As drinking health to bride and groom<br/>
We wish them store of happy days.
</p>
<p>
Nor count me all to blame if I<br/>
Conjecture of a stiller guest,<br/>
Perchance, perchance, among the rest,<br/>
And, tho' in silence, wishing joy.
</p>
<p>
But they must go, the time draws on,<br/>
And those white-favour'd horses wait;<br/>
They rise, but linger; it is late;<br/>
Farewell, we kiss, and they are gone.
</p>
<p>
A shade falls on us like the dark<br/>
From little cloudlets on the grass,<br/>
But sweeps away as out we pass<br/>
To range the woods, to roam the park,
</p>
<p>
Discussing how their courtship grew,<br/>
And talk of others that are wed,<br/>
And how she look'd, and what he said,<br/>
And back we come at fall of dew.
</p>
<p>
Again the feast, the speech, the glee,<br/>
The shade of passing thought, the wealth<br/>
Of words and wit, the double health,<br/>
The crowning cup, the three-times-three,
</p>
<p>
And last the dance;&mdash;till I retire:<br/>
Dumb is that tower which spake so loud,<br/>
And high in heaven the streaming cloud,<br/>
And on the downs a rising fire:
</p>
<p>
And rise, O moon, from yonder down,<br/>
Till over down and over dale<br/>
All night the shining vapour sail<br/>
And pass the silent-lighted town,
</p>
<p>
The white-faced halls, the glancing rills,<br/>
And catch at every mountain head,<br/>
And o'er the friths that branch and spread<br/>
Their sleeping silver thro' the hills;
</p>
<p>
And touch with shade the bridal doors,<br/>
With tender gloom the roof, the wall;<br/>
And breaking let the splendour fall<br/>
To spangle all the happy shores
</p>
<p>
By which they rest, and ocean sounds,<br/>
And, star and system rolling past,<br/>
A soul shall draw from out the vast<br/>
And strike his being into bounds,
</p>
<p>
And, moved thro' life of lower phase,<br/>
Result in man, be born and think,<br/>
And act and love, a closer link<br/>
Betwixt us and the crowning race
</p>
<p>
Of those that, eye to eye, shall look<br/>
On knowledge, under whose command<br/>
Is Earth and Earth's, and in their hand<br/>
Is Nature like an open book;
</p>
<p>
No longer half-akin to brute,<br/>
For all we thought and loved and did,<br/>
And hoped, and suffer'd, is but seed<br/>
Of what in them is flower and fruit;
</p>
<p>
Whereof the man, that with me trod<br/>
This planet, was a noble type<br/>
Appearing ere the times were ripe,<br/>
That friend of mine who lives in God,
</p>
<p>
That God, which ever lives and loves,<br/>
One God, one law, one element,<br/>
And one far-off divine event,<br/>
To which the whole creation moves.
</p>
<p>THE END</p>

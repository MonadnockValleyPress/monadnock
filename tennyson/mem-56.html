<h1>In Memoriam A. H. H.</h1>
<h2>by Alfred Tennyson</h2>
<h3>LVI</h3>
<p>
'So careful of the type?' but no.<br/>
From scarped cliff and quarried stone<br/>
She cries, 'A thousand types are gone:<br/>
I care for nothing, all shall go.
</p>
<p>
'Thou makest thine appeal to me:<br/>
I bring to life, I bring to death:<br/>
The spirit does but mean the breath:<br/>
I know no more.' And he, shall he,
</p>
<p>
Man, her last work, who seem'd so fair,<br/>
Such splendid purpose in his eyes,<br/>
Who roll'd the psalm to wintry skies,<br/>
Who built him fanes of fruitless prayer,
</p>
<p>
Who trusted God was love indeed<br/>
And love Creation's final law?<br/>
Tho' Nature, red in tooth and claw<br/>
With ravine, shriek'd against his creed?
</p>
<p>
Who loved, who suffer'd countless ills,<br/>
Who battled for the True, the Just,<br/>
Be blown about the desert dust,<br/>
Or seal'd within the iron hills?
</p>
<p>
No more? A monster then, a dream,<br/>
A discord. Dragons of the prime,<br/>
That tare each other in their slime,<br/>
Were mellow music match'd with him.
</p>
<p>
O life as futile, then, as frail!<br/>
O for thy voice to soothe and bless!<br/>
What hope of answer, or redress?<br/>
Behind the veil, behind the veil.

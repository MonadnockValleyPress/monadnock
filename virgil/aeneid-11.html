<h1>Aeneid</h1>
<h2>by Virgil</h2>
<h3>Book XI</h3>
<p>
Scarce had the rosy Morning rais'd her head<br/>
Above the waves, and left her wat'ry bed;<br/>
The pious chief, whom double cares attend<br/>
For his unburied soldiers and his friend,<br/>
Yet first to Heav'n perform'd a victor's vows:<br/>
He bar'd an ancient oak of all her boughs;<br/>
Then on a rising ground the trunk he plac'd,<br/>
Which with the spoils of his dead foe he grac'd.<br/>
The coat of arms by proud Mezentius worn,<br/>
Now on a naked snag in triumph borne,<br/>
Was hung on high, and glitter'd from afar,<br/>
A trophy sacred to the God of War.<br/>
Above his arms, fix'd on the leafless wood,<br/>
Appear'd his plumy crest, besmear'd with blood:<br/>
His brazen buckler on the left was seen;<br/>
Truncheons of shiver'd lances hung between;<br/>
And on the right was placed his corslet, bor'd;<br/>
And to the neck was tied his unavailing sword.
</p>
<p>
A crowd of chiefs inclose the godlike man,<br/>
Who thus, conspicuous in the midst, began:<br/>
"Our toils, my friends, are crown'd with sure success;<br/>
The greater part perform'd, achieve the less.<br/>
Now follow cheerful to the trembling town;<br/>
Press but an entrance, and presume it won.<br/>
Fear is no more, for fierce Mezentius lies,<br/>
As the first fruits of war, a sacrifice.<br/>
Turnus shall fall extended on the plain,<br/>
And, in this omen, is already slain.<br/>
Prepar'd in arms, pursue your happy chance;<br/>
That none unwarn'd may plead his ignorance,<br/>
And I, at Heav'n's appointed hour, may find<br/>
Your warlike ensigns waving in the wind.<br/>
Meantime the rites and fun'ral pomps prepare,<br/>
Due to your dead companions of the war:<br/>
The last respect the living can bestow,<br/>
To shield their shadows from contempt below.<br/>
That conquer'd earth be theirs, for which they fought,<br/>
And which for us with their own blood they bought;<br/>
But first the corpse of our unhappy friend<br/>
To the sad city of Evander send,<br/>
Who, not inglorious, in his age's bloom,<br/>
Was hurried hence by too severe a doom."
</p>
<p>
Thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way,<br/>
Where, new in death, lamented Pallas lay.<br/>
Acoetes watch'd the corpse; whose youth deserv'd<br/>
The father's trust; and now the son he serv'd<br/>
With equal faith, but less auspicious care.<br/>
Th' attendants of the slain his sorrow share.<br/>
A troop of Trojans mix'd with these appear,<br/>
And mourning matrons with dishevel'd hair.<br/>
Soon as the prince appears, they raise a cry;<br/>
All beat their breasts, and echoes rend the sky.<br/>
They rear his drooping forehead from the ground;<br/>
But, when Aeneas view'd the grisly wound<br/>
Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore,<br/>
And the fair flesh distain'd with purple gore;<br/>
First, melting into tears, the pious man<br/>
Deplor'd so sad a sight, then thus began:<br/>
"Unhappy youth! when Fortune gave the rest<br/>
Of my full wishes, she refus'd the best!<br/>
She came; but brought not thee along, to bless<br/>
My longing eyes, and share in my success:<br/>
She grudg'd thy safe return, the triumphs due<br/>
To prosp'rous valour, in the public view.<br/>
Not thus I promis'd, when thy father lent<br/>
Thy needless succour with a sad consent;<br/>
Embrac'd me, parting for th' Etrurian land,<br/>
And sent me to possess a large command.<br/>
He warn'd, and from his own experience told,<br/>
Our foes were warlike, disciplin'd, and bold.<br/>
And now perhaps, in hopes of thy return,<br/>
Rich odors on his loaded altars burn,<br/>
While we, with vain officious pomp, prepare<br/>
To send him back his portion of the war,<br/>
A bloody breathless body, which can owe<br/>
No farther debt, but to the pow'rs below.<br/>
The wretched father, ere his race is run,<br/>
Shall view the fun'ral honours of his son.<br/>
These are my triumphs of the Latian war,<br/>
Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care!<br/>
And yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see<br/>
A son whose death disgrac'd his ancestry;<br/>
Thou shalt not blush, old man, however griev'd:<br/>
Thy Pallas no dishonest wound receiv'd.<br/>
He died no death to make thee wish, too late,<br/>
Thou hadst not liv'd to see his shameful fate:<br/>
But what a champion has th' Ausonian coast,<br/>
And what a friend hast thou, Ascanius, lost!"
</p>
<p>
Thus having mourn'd, he gave the word around,<br/>
To raise the breathless body from the ground;<br/>
And chose a thousand horse, the flow'r of all<br/>
His warlike troops, to wait the funeral,<br/>
To bear him back and share Evander's grief:<br/>
A well-becoming, but a weak relief.<br/>
Of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier,<br/>
Then on their shoulders the sad burden rear.<br/>
The body on this rural hearse is borne:<br/>
Strew'd leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn.<br/>
All pale he lies, and looks a lovely flow'r,<br/>
New cropp'd by virgin hands, to dress the bow'r:<br/>
Unfaded yet, but yet unfed below,<br/>
No more to mother earth or the green stern shall owe.<br/>
Then two fair vests, of wondrous work and cost,<br/>
Of purple woven, and with gold emboss'd,<br/>
For ornament the Trojan hero brought,<br/>
Which with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought.<br/>
One vest array'd the corpse; and one they spread<br/>
O'er his clos'd eyes, and wrapp'd around his head,<br/>
That, when the yellow hair in flame should fall,<br/>
The catching fire might burn the golden caul.<br/>
Besides, the spoils of foes in battle slain,<br/>
When he descended on the Latian plain;<br/>
Arms, trappings, horses, by the hearse are led<br/>
In long array—th' achievements of the dead.<br/>
Then, pinion'd with their hands behind, appear<br/>
Th' unhappy captives, marching in the rear,<br/>
Appointed off'rings in the victor's name,<br/>
To sprinkle with their blood the fun'ral flame.<br/>
Inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne;<br/>
Gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn;<br/>
And fair inscriptions fix'd, and titles read<br/>
Of Latian leaders conquer'd by the dead.
</p>
<p>
Acoetes on his pupil's corpse attends,<br/>
With feeble steps, supported by his friends.<br/>
Pausing at ev'ry pace, in sorrow drown'd,<br/>
Betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground;<br/>
Where grov'ling while he lies in deep despair,<br/>
He beats his breast, and rends his hoary hair.<br/>
The champion's chariot next is seen to roll,<br/>
Besmear'd with hostile blood, and honourably foul.<br/>
To close the pomp, Aethon, the steed of state,<br/>
Is led, the fun'rals of his lord to wait.<br/>
Stripp'd of his trappings, with a sullen pace<br/>
He walks; and the big tears run rolling down his face.<br/>
The lance of Pallas, and the crimson crest,<br/>
Are borne behind: the victor seiz'd the rest.<br/>
The march begins: the trumpets hoarsely sound;<br/>
The pikes and lances trail along the ground.<br/>
Thus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse<br/>
To Pallantean tow'rs direct their course,<br/>
In long procession rank'd, the pious chief<br/>
Stopp'd in the rear, and gave a vent to grief:<br/>
"The public care," he said, "which war attends,<br/>
Diverts our present woes, at least suspends.<br/>
Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell!<br/>
Hail, holy relics! and a last farewell!"<br/>
He said no more, but, inly thro' he mourn'd,<br/>
Restrained his tears, and to the camp return'd.
</p>
<p>
Now suppliants, from Laurentum sent, demand<br/>
A truce, with olive branches in their hand;<br/>
Obtest his clemency, and from the plain<br/>
Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain.<br/>
They plead, that none those common rites deny<br/>
To conquer'd foes that in fair battle die.<br/>
All cause of hate was ended in their death;<br/>
Nor could he war with bodies void of breath.<br/>
A king, they hop'd, would hear a king's request,<br/>
Whose son he once was call'd, and once his guest.
</p>
<p>
Their suit, which was too just to be denied,<br/>
The hero grants, and farther thus replied:<br/>
"O Latian princes, how severe a fate<br/>
In causeless quarrels has involv'd your state,<br/>
And arm'd against an unoffending man,<br/>
Who sought your friendship ere the war began!<br/>
You beg a truce, which I would gladly give,<br/>
Not only for the slain, but those who live.<br/>
I came not hither but by Heav'n's command,<br/>
And sent by fate to share the Latian land.<br/>
Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied<br/>
My proffer'd friendship, and my promis'd bride;<br/>
Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try<br/>
His cause in arms, to conquer or to die.<br/>
My right and his are in dispute: the slain<br/>
Fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain.<br/>
In equal arms let us alone contend;<br/>
And let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend.<br/>
This is the way (so tell him) to possess<br/>
The royal virgin, and restore the peace.<br/>
Bear this message back, with ample leave,<br/>
That your slain friends may fun'ral rites receive."
</p>
<p>
Thus having said—th' embassadors, amaz'd,<br/>
Stood mute a while, and on each other gaz'd.<br/>
Drances, their chief, who harbour'd in his breast<br/>
Long hate to Turnus, as his foe profess'd,<br/>
Broke silence first, and to the godlike man,<br/>
With graceful action bowing, thus began:<br/>
"Auspicious prince, in arms a mighty name,<br/>
But yet whose actions far transcend your fame;<br/>
Would I your justice or your force express,<br/>
Thought can but equal; and all words are less.<br/>
Your answer we shall thankfully relate,<br/>
And favours granted to the Latian state.<br/>
If wish'd success our labour shall attend,<br/>
Think peace concluded, and the king your friend:<br/>
Let Turnus leave the realm to your command,<br/>
And seek alliance in some other land:<br/>
Build you the city which your fates assign;<br/>
We shall be proud in the great work to join."
</p>
<p>
Thus Drances; and his words so well persuade<br/>
The rest impower'd, that soon a truce is made.<br/>
Twelve days the term allow'd: and, during those,<br/>
Latians and Trojans, now no longer foes,<br/>
Mix'd in the woods, for fun'ral piles prepare<br/>
To fell the timber, and forget the war.<br/>
Loud axes thro' the groaning groves resound;<br/>
Oak, mountain ash, and poplar spread the ground;<br/>
First fall from high; and some the trunks receive<br/>
In loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave.
</p>
<p>
And now the fatal news by Fame is blown<br/>
Thro' the short circuit of th' Arcadian town,<br/>
Of Pallas slain—by Fame, which just before<br/>
His triumphs on distended pinions bore.<br/>
Rushing from out the gate, the people stand,<br/>
Each with a fun'ral flambeau in his hand.<br/>
Wildly they stare, distracted with amaze:<br/>
The fields are lighten'd with a fiery blaze,<br/>
That cast a sullen splendour on their friends,<br/>
The marching troop which their dead prince attends.<br/>
Both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry;<br/>
The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply,<br/>
And their mix'd mourning rends the vaulted sky.<br/>
The town is fill'd with tumult and with tears,<br/>
Till the loud clamours reach Evander's ears:<br/>
Forgetful of his state, he runs along,<br/>
With a disorder'd pace, and cleaves the throng;<br/>
Falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies,<br/>
With silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes.<br/>
Short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks<br/>
A passage, and at once he weeps and speaks:
</p>
<p>
"O Pallas! thou hast fail'd thy plighted word,<br/>
To fight with caution, not to tempt the sword!<br/>
I warn'd thee, but in vain; for well I knew<br/>
What perils youthful ardour would pursue,<br/>
That boiling blood would carry thee too far,<br/>
Young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war!<br/>
O curst essay of arms, disastrous doom,<br/>
Prelude of bloody fields, and fights to come!<br/>
Hard elements of unauspicious war,<br/>
Vain vows to Heav'n, and unavailing care!<br/>
Thrice happy thou, dear partner of my bed,<br/>
Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled,<br/>
Prescious of ills, and leaving me behind,<br/>
To drink the dregs of life by fate assign'd!<br/>
Beyond the goal of nature I have gone:<br/>
My Pallas late set out, but reach'd too soon.<br/>
If, for my league against th' Ausonian state,<br/>
Amidst their weapons I had found my fate,<br/>
(Deserv'd from them,) then I had been return'd<br/>
A breathless victor, and my son had mourn'd.<br/>
Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid,<br/>
Nor grudge th' alliance I so gladly made.<br/>
'Twas not his fault, my Pallas fell so young,<br/>
But my own crime, for having liv'd too long.<br/>
Yet, since the gods had destin'd him to die,<br/>
At least he led the way to victory:<br/>
First for his friends he won the fatal shore,<br/>
And sent whole herds of slaughter'd foes before;<br/>
A death too great, too glorious to deplore.<br/>
Nor will I add new honours to thy grave,<br/>
Content with those the Trojan hero gave:<br/>
That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends design'd,<br/>
In which the Tuscan chiefs and army join'd.<br/>
Great spoils and trophies, gain'd by thee, they bear:<br/>
Then let thy own achievements be thy share.<br/>
Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood,<br/>
Whose mighty trunk had better grac'd the wood,<br/>
If Pallas had arriv'd, with equal length<br/>
Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength.<br/>
But why, unhappy man, dost thou detain<br/>
These troops, to view the tears thou shedd'st in vain?<br/>
Go, friends, this message to your lord relate:<br/>
Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate,<br/>
And, after Pallas' death, live ling'ring on,<br/>
'Tis to behold his vengeance for my son.<br/>
I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head<br/>
Is owing to the living and the dead.<br/>
My son and I expect it from his hand;<br/>
'Tis all that he can give, or we demand.<br/>
Joy is no more; but I would gladly go,<br/>
To greet my Pallas with such news below."
</p>
<p>
The morn had now dispell'd the shades of night,<br/>
Restoring toils, when she restor'd the light.<br/>
The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command<br/>
To raise the piles along the winding strand.<br/>
Their friends convey the dead fun'ral fires;<br/>
Black smould'ring smoke from the green wood expires;<br/>
The light of heav'n is chok'd, and the new day retires.<br/>
Then thrice around the kindled piles they go<br/>
(For ancient custom had ordain'd it so)<br/>
Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led;<br/>
And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead.<br/>
Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground,<br/>
And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound.<br/>
Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw<br/>
The spoils, in battle taken from the foe:<br/>
Helms, bits emboss'd, and swords of shining steel;<br/>
One casts a target, one a chariot wheel;<br/>
Some to their fellows their own arms restore:<br/>
The falchions which in luckless fight they bore,<br/>
Their bucklers pierc'd, their darts bestow'd in vain,<br/>
And shiver'd lances gather'd from the plain.<br/>
Whole herds of offer'd bulls, about the fire,<br/>
And bristled boars, and woolly sheep expire.<br/>
Around the piles a careful troop attends,<br/>
To watch the wasting flames, and weep their burning friends;<br/>
Ling'ring along the shore, till dewy night<br/>
New decks the face of heav'n with starry light.
</p>
<p>
The conquer'd Latians, with like pious care,<br/>
Piles without number for their dead prepare.<br/>
Part in the places where they fell are laid;<br/>
And part are to the neighb'ring fields convey'd.<br/>
The corps of kings, and captains of renown,<br/>
Borne off in state, are buried in the town;<br/>
The rest, unhonour'd, and without a name,<br/>
Are cast a common heap to feed the flame.<br/>
Trojans and Latians vie with like desires<br/>
To make the field of battle shine with fires,<br/>
And the promiscuous blaze to heav'n aspires.
</p>
<p>
Now had the morning thrice renew'd the light,<br/>
And thrice dispell'd the shadows of the night,<br/>
When those who round the wasted fires remain,<br/>
Perform the last sad office to the slain.<br/>
They rake the yet warm ashes from below;<br/>
These, and the bones unburn'd, in earth bestow;<br/>
These relics with their country rites they grace,<br/>
And raise a mount of turf to mark the place.
</p>
<p>
But, in the palace of the king, appears<br/>
A scene more solemn, and a pomp of tears.<br/>
Maids, matrons, widows, mix their common moans;<br/>
Orphans their sires, and sires lament their sons.<br/>
All in that universal sorrow share,<br/>
And curse the cause of this unhappy war:<br/>
A broken league, a bride unjustly sought,<br/>
A crown usurp'd, which with their blood is bought!<br/>
These are the crimes with which they load the name<br/>
Of Turnus, and on him alone exclaim:<br/>
"Let him who lords it o'er th' Ausonian land<br/>
Engage the Trojan hero hand to hand:<br/>
His is the gain; our lot is but to serve;<br/>
'Tis just, the sway he seeks, he should deserve."<br/>
This Drances aggravates; and adds, with spite:<br/>
"His foe expects, and dares him to the fight."<br/>
Nor Turnus wants a party, to support<br/>
His cause and credit in the Latian court.<br/>
His former acts secure his present fame,<br/>
And the queen shades him with her mighty name.
</p>
<p>
While thus their factious minds with fury burn,<br/>
The legates from th' Aetolian prince return:<br/>
Sad news they bring, that, after all the cost<br/>
And care employ'd, their embassy is lost;<br/>
That Diomedes refus'd his aid in war,<br/>
Unmov'd with presents, and as deaf to pray'r.<br/>
Some new alliance must elsewhere be sought,<br/>
Or peace with Troy on hard conditions bought.
</p>
<p>
Latinus, sunk in sorrow, finds too late,<br/>
A foreign son is pointed out by fate;<br/>
And, till Aeneas shall Lavinia wed,<br/>
The wrath of Heav'n is hov'ring o'er his head.<br/>
The gods, he saw, espous'd the juster side,<br/>
When late their titles in the field were tried:<br/>
Witness the fresh laments, and fun'ral tears undried.<br/>
Thus, full of anxious thought, he summons all<br/>
The Latian senate to the council hall.<br/>
The princes come, commanded by their head,<br/>
And crowd the paths that to the palace lead.<br/>
Supreme in pow'r, and reverenc'd for his years,<br/>
He takes the throne, and in the midst appears.<br/>
Majestically sad, he sits in state,<br/>
And bids his envoys their success relate.
</p>
<p>
When Venulus began, the murmuring sound<br/>
Was hush'd, and sacred silence reign'd around.<br/>
"We have," said he, "perform'd your high command,<br/>
And pass'd with peril a long tract of land:<br/>
We reach'd the place desir'd; with wonder fill'd,<br/>
The Grecian tents and rising tow'rs beheld.<br/>
Great Diomede has compass'd round with walls<br/>
The city, which Argyripa he calls,<br/>
From his own Argos nam'd. We touch'd, with joy,<br/>
The royal hand that raz'd unhappy Troy.<br/>
When introduc'd, our presents first we bring,<br/>
Then crave an instant audience from the king.<br/>
His leave obtain'd, our native soil we name,<br/>
And tell th' important cause for which we came.<br/>
Attentively he heard us, while we spoke;<br/>
Then, with soft accents, and a pleasing look,<br/>
Made this return: 'Ausonian race, of old<br/>
Renown'd for peace, and for an age of gold,<br/>
What madness has your alter'd minds possess'd,<br/>
To change for war hereditary rest,<br/>
Solicit arms unknown, and tempt the sword,<br/>
A needless ill your ancestors abhorr'd?<br/>
We—for myself I speak, and all the name<br/>
Of Grecians, who to Troy's destruction came,<br/>
(Omitting those who were in battle slain,<br/>
Or borne by rolling Simois to the main)<br/>
Not one but suffer'd, and too dearly bought<br/>
The prize of honour which in arms he sought;<br/>
Some doom'd to death, and some in exile driv'n.<br/>
Outcasts, abandon'd by the care of Heav'n;<br/>
So worn, so wretched, so despis'd a crew,<br/>
As ev'n old Priam might with pity view.<br/>
Witness the vessels by Minerva toss'd<br/>
In storms; the vengeful Capharean coast;<br/>
Th' Euboean rocks! the prince, whose brother led<br/>
Our armies to revenge his injur'd bed,<br/>
In Egypt lost! Ulysses with his men<br/>
Have seen Charybdis and the Cyclops' den.<br/>
Why should I name Idomeneus, in vain<br/>
Restor'd to scepters, and expell'd again?<br/>
Or young Achilles, by his rival slain?<br/>
Ev'n he, the King of Men, the foremost name<br/>
Of all the Greeks, and most renown'd by fame,<br/>
The proud revenger of another's wife,<br/>
Yet by his own adult'ress lost his life;<br/>
Fell at his threshold; and the spoils of Troy<br/>
The foul polluters of his bed enjoy.<br/>
The gods have envied me the sweets of life,<br/>
My much lov'd country, and my more lov'd wife:<br/>
Banish'd from both, I mourn; while in the sky,<br/>
Transform'd to birds, my lost companions fly:<br/>
Hov'ring about the coasts, they make their moan,<br/>
And cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own.<br/>
What squalid spectres, in the dead of night,<br/>
Break my short sleep, and skim before my sight!<br/>
I might have promis'd to myself those harms,<br/>
Mad as I was, when I, with mortal arms,<br/>
Presum'd against immortal pow'rs to move,<br/>
And violate with wounds the Queen of Love.<br/>
Such arms this hand shall never more employ;<br/>
No hate remains with me to ruin'd Troy.<br/>
I war not with its dust; nor am I glad<br/>
To think of past events, or good or bad.<br/>
Your presents I return: whate'er you bring<br/>
To buy my friendship, send the Trojan king.<br/>
We met in fight; I know him, to my cost:<br/>
With what a whirling force his lance he toss'd!<br/>
Heav'ns! what a spring was in his arm, to throw!<br/>
How high he held his shield, and rose at ev'ry blow!<br/>
Had Troy produc'd two more his match in might,<br/>
They would have chang'd the fortune of the fight:<br/>
Th' invasion of the Greeks had been return'd,<br/>
Our empire wasted, and our cities burn'd.<br/>
The long defence the Trojan people made,<br/>
The war protracted, and the siege delay'd,<br/>
Were due to Hector's and this hero's hand:<br/>
Both brave alike, and equal in command;<br/>
Aeneas, not inferior in the field,<br/>
In pious reverence to the gods excell'd.<br/>
Make peace, ye Latians, and avoid with care<br/>
Th' impending dangers of a fatal war.'<br/>
He said no more; but, with this cold excuse,<br/>
Refus'd th' alliance, and advis'd a truce."
</p>
<p>
Thus Venulus concluded his report.<br/>
A jarring murmur fill'd the factious court:<br/>
As, when a torrent rolls with rapid force,<br/>
And dashes o'er the stones that stop the course,<br/>
The flood, constrain'd within a scanty space,<br/>
Roars horrible along th' uneasy race;<br/>
White foam in gath'ring eddies floats around;<br/>
The rocky shores rebellow to the sound.
</p>
<p>
The murmur ceas'd: then from his lofty throne<br/>
The king invok'd the gods, and thus begun:<br/>
"I wish, ye Latins, what we now debate<br/>
Had been resolv'd before it was too late.<br/>
Much better had it been for you and me,<br/>
Unforc'd by this our last necessity,<br/>
To have been earlier wise, than now to call<br/>
A council, when the foe surrounds the wall.<br/>
O citizens, we wage unequal war,<br/>
With men not only Heav'n's peculiar care,<br/>
But Heav'n's own race; unconquer'd in the field,<br/>
Or, conquer'd, yet unknowing how to yield.<br/>
What hopes you had in Diomedes, lay down:<br/>
Our hopes must centre on ourselves alone.<br/>
Yet those how feeble, and, indeed, how vain,<br/>
You see too well; nor need my words explain.<br/>
Vanquish'd without resource; laid flat by fate;<br/>
Factions within, a foe without the gate!<br/>
Not but I grant that all perform'd their parts<br/>
With manly force, and with undaunted hearts:<br/>
With our united strength the war we wag'd;<br/>
With equal numbers, equal arms, engag'd.<br/>
You see th' event.—Now hear what I propose,<br/>
To save our friends, and satisfy our foes.<br/>
A tract of land the Latins have possess'd<br/>
Along the Tiber, stretching to the west,<br/>
Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till,<br/>
And their mix'd cattle graze the fruitful hill.<br/>
Those mountains fill'd with firs, that lower land,<br/>
If you consent, the Trojan shall command,<br/>
Call'd into part of what is ours; and there,<br/>
On terms agreed, the common country share.<br/>
There let them build and settle, if they please;<br/>
Unless they choose once more to cross the seas,<br/>
In search of seats remote from Italy,<br/>
And from unwelcome inmates set us free.<br/>
Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed,<br/>
Or twice as many more, if more they need.<br/>
Materials are at hand; a well-grown wood<br/>
Runs equal with the margin of the flood:<br/>
Let them the number and the form assign;<br/>
The care and cost of all the stores be mine.<br/>
To treat the peace, a hundred senators<br/>
Shall be commission'd hence with ample pow'rs,<br/>
With olive the presents they shall bear,<br/>
A purple robe, a royal iv'ry chair,<br/>
And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear,<br/>
And sums of gold. Among yourselves debate<br/>
This great affair, and save the sinking state."
</p>
<p>
Then Drances took the word, who grudg'd, long since,<br/>
The rising glories of the Daunian prince.<br/>
Factious and rich, bold at the council board,<br/>
But cautious in the field, he shunn'd the sword;<br/>
A close caballer, and tongue-valiant lord.<br/>
Noble his mother was, and near the throne;<br/>
But, what his father's parentage, unknown.<br/>
He rose, and took th' advantage of the times,<br/>
To load young Turnus with invidious crimes.<br/>
"Such truths, O king," said he, "your words contain,<br/>
As strike the sense, and all replies are vain;<br/>
Nor are your loyal subjects now to seek<br/>
What common needs require, but fear to speak.<br/>
Let him give leave of speech, that haughty man,<br/>
Whose pride this unauspicious war began;<br/>
For whose ambition (let me dare to say,<br/>
Fear set apart, tho' death is in my way)<br/>
The plains of Latium run with blood around.<br/>
So many valiant heroes bite the ground;<br/>
Dejected grief in ev'ry face appears;<br/>
A town in mourning, and a land in tears;<br/>
While he, th' undoubted author of our harms,<br/>
The man who menaces the gods with arms,<br/>
Yet, after all his boasts, forsook the fight,<br/>
And sought his safety in ignoble flight.<br/>
Now, best of kings, since you propose to send<br/>
Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend;<br/>
Add yet a greater at our joint request,<br/>
One which he values more than all the rest:<br/>
Give him the fair Lavinia for his bride;<br/>
With that alliance let the league be tied,<br/>
And for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide.<br/>
Let insolence no longer awe the throne;<br/>
But, with a father's right, bestow your own.<br/>
For this maligner of the general good,<br/>
If still we fear his force, he must be woo'd;<br/>
His haughty godhead we with pray'rs implore,<br/>
Your scepter to release, and our just rights restore.<br/>
O cursed cause of all our ills, must we<br/>
Wage wars unjust, and fall in fight, for thee!<br/>
What right hast thou to rule the Latian state,<br/>
And send us out to meet our certain fate?<br/>
'Tis a destructive war: from Turnus' hand<br/>
Our peace and public safety we demand.<br/>
Let the fair bride to the brave chief remain;<br/>
If not, the peace, without the pledge, is vain.<br/>
Turnus, I know you think me not your friend,<br/>
Nor will I much with your belief contend:<br/>
I beg your greatness not to give the law<br/>
In others' realms, but, beaten, to withdraw.<br/>
Pity your own, or pity our estate;<br/>
Nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate.<br/>
Your interest is, the war should never cease;<br/>
But we have felt enough to wish the peace:<br/>
A land exhausted to the last remains,<br/>
Depopulated towns, and driven plains.<br/>
Yet, if desire of fame, and thirst of pow'r,<br/>
A beauteous princess, with a crown in dow'r,<br/>
So fire your mind, in arms assert your right,<br/>
And meet your foe, who dares you to the fight.<br/>
Mankind, it seems, is made for you alone;<br/>
We, but the slaves who mount you to the throne:<br/>
A base ignoble crowd, without a name,<br/>
Unwept, unworthy, of the fun'ral flame,<br/>
By duty bound to forfeit each his life,<br/>
That Turnus may possess a royal wife.<br/>
Permit not, mighty man, so mean a crew<br/>
Should share such triumphs, and detain from you<br/>
The post of honour, your undoubted due.<br/>
Rather alone your matchless force employ,<br/>
To merit what alone you must enjoy."
</p>
<p>
These words, so full of malice mix'd with art,<br/>
Inflam'd with rage the youthful hero's heart.<br/>
Then, groaning from the bottom of his breast,<br/>
He heav'd for wind, and thus his wrath express'd:<br/>
"You, Drances, never want a stream of words,<br/>
Then, when the public need requires our swords.<br/>
First in the council hall to steer the state,<br/>
And ever foremost in a tongue-debate,<br/>
While our strong walls secure us from the foe,<br/>
Ere yet with blood our ditches overflow:<br/>
But let the potent orator declaim,<br/>
And with the brand of coward blot my name;<br/>
Free leave is giv'n him, when his fatal hand<br/>
Has cover'd with more corps the sanguine strand,<br/>
And high as mine his tow'ring trophies stand.<br/>
If any doubt remains, who dares the most,<br/>
Let us decide it at the Trojan's cost,<br/>
And issue both abreast, where honour calls—<br/>
(Foes are not far to seek without the walls)<br/>
Unless his noisy tongue can only fight,<br/>
And feet were giv'n him but to speed his flight.<br/>
I beaten from the field? I forc'd away?<br/>
Who, but so known a dastard, dares to say?<br/>
Had he but ev'n beheld the fight, his eyes<br/>
Had witness'd for me what his tongue denies:<br/>
What heaps of Trojans by this hand were slain,<br/>
And how the bloody Tiber swell'd the main.<br/>
All saw, but he, th' Arcadian troops retire<br/>
In scatter'd squadrons, and their prince expire.<br/>
The giant brothers, in their camp, have found,<br/>
I was not forc'd with ease to quit my ground.<br/>
Not such the Trojans tried me, when, inclos'd,<br/>
I singly their united arms oppos'd:<br/>
First forc'd an entrance thro' their thick array;<br/>
Then, glutted with their slaughter, freed my way.<br/>
'Tis a destructive war? So let it be,<br/>
But to the Phrygian pirate, and to thee!<br/>
Meantime proceed to fill the people's ears<br/>
With false reports, their minds with panic fears:<br/>
Extol the strength of a twice-conquer'd race;<br/>
Our foes encourage, and our friends debase.<br/>
Believe thy fables, and the Trojan town<br/>
Triumphant stands; the Grecians are o'erthrown;<br/>
Suppliant at Hector's feet Achilles lies,<br/>
And Diomede from fierce Aeneas flies.<br/>
Say rapid Aufidus with awful dread<br/>
Runs backward from the sea, and hides his head,<br/>
When the great Trojan on his bank appears;<br/>
For that's as true as thy dissembled fears<br/>
Of my revenge. Dismiss that vanity:<br/>
Thou, Drances, art below a death from me.<br/>
Let that vile soul in that vile body rest;<br/>
The lodging is well worthy of the guest.
</p>
<p>
"Now, royal father, to the present state<br/>
Of our affairs, and of this high debate:<br/>
If in your arms thus early you diffide,<br/>
And think your fortune is already tried;<br/>
If one defeat has brought us down so low,<br/>
As never more in fields to meet the foe;<br/>
Then I conclude for peace: 'tis time to treat,<br/>
And lie like vassals at the victor's feet.<br/>
But, O! if any ancient blood remains,<br/>
One drop of all our fathers', in our veins,<br/>
That man would I prefer before the rest,<br/>
Who dar'd his death with an undaunted breast;<br/>
Who comely fell, by no dishonest wound,<br/>
To shun that sight, and, dying, gnaw'd the ground.<br/>
But, if we still have fresh recruits in store,<br/>
If our confederates can afford us more;<br/>
If the contended field we bravely fought,<br/>
And not a bloodless victory was bought;<br/>
Their losses equal'd ours; and, for their slain,<br/>
With equal fires they fill'd the shining plain;<br/>
Why thus, unforc'd, should we so tamely yield,<br/>
And, ere the trumpet sounds, resign the field?<br/>
Good unexpected, evils unforeseen,<br/>
Appear by turns, as fortune shifts the scene:<br/>
Some, rais'd aloft, come tumbling down amain;<br/>
Then fall so hard, they bound and rise again.<br/>
If Diomede refuse his aid to lend,<br/>
The great Messapus yet remains our friend:<br/>
Tolumnius, who foretells events, is ours;<br/>
Th' Italian chiefs and princes join their pow'rs:<br/>
Nor least in number, nor in name the last,<br/>
Your own brave subjects have your cause embrac'd<br/>
Above the rest, the Volscian Amazon<br/>
Contains an army in herself alone,<br/>
And heads a squadron, terrible to sight,<br/>
With glitt'ring shields, in brazen armour bright.<br/>
Yet, if the foe a single fight demand,<br/>
And I alone the public peace withstand;<br/>
If you consent, he shall not be refus'd,<br/>
Nor find a hand to victory unus'd.<br/>
This new Achilles, let him take the field,<br/>
With fated armour, and Vulcanian shield!<br/>
For you, my royal father, and my fame,<br/>
I, Turnus, not the least of all my name,<br/>
Devote my soul. He calls me hand to hand,<br/>
And I alone will answer his demand.<br/>
Drances shall rest secure, and neither share<br/>
The danger, nor divide the prize of war."
</p>
<p>
While they debate, nor these nor those will yield,<br/>
Aeneas draws his forces to the field,<br/>
And moves his camp. The scouts with flying speed<br/>
Return, and thro' the frighted city spread<br/>
Th' unpleasing news, the Trojans are descried,<br/>
In battle marching by the river side,<br/>
And bending to the town. They take th' alarm:<br/>
Some tremble, some are bold; all in confusion arm.<br/>
Th' impetuous youth press forward to the field;<br/>
They clash the sword, and clatter on the shield:<br/>
The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry;<br/>
Old feeble men with fainter groans reply;<br/>
A jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky,<br/>
Like that of swans remurm'ring to the floods,<br/>
Or birds of diff'ring kinds in hollow woods.
</p>
<p>
Turnus th' occasion takes, and cries aloud:<br/>
"Talk on, ye quaint haranguers of the crowd:<br/>
Declaim in praise of peace, when danger calls,<br/>
And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls."<br/>
He said, and, turning short, with speedy pace,<br/>
Casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place:<br/>
"Thou, Volusus, the Volscian troops command<br/>
To mount; and lead thyself our Ardean band.<br/>
Messapus and Catillus, post your force<br/>
Along the fields, to charge the Trojan horse.<br/>
Some guard the passes, others man the wall;<br/>
Drawn up in arms, the rest attend my call."
</p>
<p>
They swarm from ev'ry quarter of the town,<br/>
And with disorder'd haste the rampires crown.<br/>
Good old Latinus, when he saw, too late,<br/>
The gath'ring storm just breaking on the state,<br/>
Dismiss'd the council till a fitter time,<br/>
And own'd his easy temper as his crime,<br/>
Who, forc'd against his reason, had complied<br/>
To break the treaty for the promis'd bride.
</p>
<p>
Some help to sink new trenches; others aid<br/>
To ram the stones, or raise the palisade.<br/>
Hoarse trumpets sound th' alarm; around the walls<br/>
Runs a distracted crew, whom their last labour calls.<br/>
A sad procession in the streets is seen,<br/>
Of matrons, that attend the mother queen:<br/>
High in her chair she sits, and, at her side,<br/>
With downcast eyes, appears the fatal bride.<br/>
They mount the cliff, where Pallas' temple stands;<br/>
Pray'rs in their mouths, and presents in their hands,<br/>
With censers first they fume the sacred shrine,<br/>
Then in this common supplication join:<br/>
"O patroness of arms, unspotted maid,<br/>
Propitious hear, and lend thy Latins aid!<br/>
Break short the pirate's lance; pronounce his fate,<br/>
And lay the Phrygian low before the gate."
</p>
<p>
Now Turnus arms for fight. His back and breast<br/>
Well-temper'd steel and scaly brass invest:<br/>
The cuishes which his brawny thighs infold<br/>
Are mingled metal damask'd o'er with gold.<br/>
His faithful falchion sits upon his side;<br/>
Nor casque, nor crest, his manly features hide:<br/>
But, bare to view, amid surrounding friends,<br/>
With godlike grace, he from the tow'r descends.<br/>
Exulting in his strength, he seems to dare<br/>
His absent rival, and to promise war.<br/>
Freed from his keepers, thus, with broken reins,<br/>
The wanton courser prances o'er the plains,<br/>
Or in the pride of youth o'erleaps the mounds,<br/>
And snuffs the females in forbidden grounds.<br/>
Or seeks his wat'ring in the well-known flood,<br/>
To quench his thirst, and cool his fiery blood:<br/>
He swims luxuriant in the liquid plain,<br/>
And o'er his shoulder flows his waving mane:<br/>
He neighs, he snorts, he bears his head on high;<br/>
Before his ample chest the frothy waters fly.
</p>
<p>
Soon as the prince appears without the gate,<br/>
The Volscians, with their virgin leader, wait<br/>
His last commands. Then, with a graceful mien,<br/>
Lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen:<br/>
Her squadron imitates, and each descends;<br/>
Whose common suit Camilla thus commends:<br/>
"If sense of honour, if a soul secure<br/>
Of inborn worth, that can all tests endure,<br/>
Can promise aught, or on itself rely<br/>
Greatly to dare, to conquer or to die;<br/>
Then, I alone, sustain'd by these, will meet<br/>
The Tyrrhene troops, and promise their defeat.<br/>
Ours be the danger, ours the sole renown:<br/>
You, gen'ral, stay behind, and guard the town."
</p>
<p>
Turnus a while stood mute, with glad surprise,<br/>
And on the fierce Virago fix'd his eyes;<br/>
Then thus return'd: "O grace of Italy,<br/>
With what becoming thanks can I reply?<br/>
Not only words lie lab'ring in my breast,<br/>
But thought itself is by thy praise oppress'd.<br/>
Yet rob me not of all; but let me join<br/>
My toils, my hazard, and my fame, with thine.<br/>
The Trojan, not in stratagem unskill'd,<br/>
Sends his light horse before to scour the field:<br/>
Himself, thro' steep ascents and thorny brakes,<br/>
A larger compass to the city takes.<br/>
This news my scouts confirm, and I prepare<br/>
To foil his cunning, and his force to dare;<br/>
With chosen foot his passage to forelay,<br/>
And place an ambush in the winding way.<br/>
Thou, with thy Volscians, face the Tuscan horse;<br/>
The brave Messapus shall thy troops enforce<br/>
With those of Tibur, and the Latian band,<br/>
Subjected all to thy supreme command."<br/>
This said, he warns Messapus to the war,<br/>
Then ev'ry chief exhorts with equal care.<br/>
All thus encourag'd, his own troops he joins,<br/>
And hastes to prosecute his deep designs.
</p>
<p>
Inclos'd with hills, a winding valley lies,<br/>
By nature form'd for fraud, and fitted for surprise.<br/>
A narrow track, by human steps untrode,<br/>
Leads, thro' perplexing thorns, to this obscure abode.<br/>
High o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands,<br/>
Whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands.<br/>
The top is level, an offensive seat<br/>
Of war; and from the war a safe retreat:<br/>
For, on the right and left, is room to press<br/>
The foes at hand, or from afar distress;<br/>
To drive 'em headlong downward, and to pour<br/>
On their descending backs a stony show'r.<br/>
Thither young Turnus took the well-known way,<br/>
Possess'd the pass, and in blind ambush lay.
</p>
<p>
Meantime Latonian Phoebe, from the skies,<br/>
Beheld th' approaching war with hateful eyes,<br/>
And call'd the light-foot Opis to her aid,<br/>
Her most belov'd and ever-trusty maid;<br/>
Then with a sigh began: "Camilla goes<br/>
To meet her death amidst her fatal foes:<br/>
The nymphs I lov'd of all my mortal train,<br/>
Invested with Diana's arms, in vain.<br/>
Nor is my kindness for the virgin new:<br/>
'Twas born with her; and with her years it grew.<br/>
Her father Metabus, when forc'd away<br/>
From old Privernum, for tyrannic sway,<br/>
Snatch'd up, and sav'd from his prevailing foes,<br/>
This tender babe, companion of his woes.<br/>
Casmilla was her mother; but he drown'd<br/>
One hissing letter in a softer sound,<br/>
And call'd Camilla. Thro' the woods he flies;<br/>
Wrapp'd in his robe the royal infant lies.<br/>
His foes in sight, he mends his weary pace;<br/>
With shout and clamours they pursue the chase.<br/>
The banks of Amasene at length he gains:
</p>
<p>
The raging flood his farther flight restrains,<br/>
Rais'd o'er the borders with unusual rains.<br/>
Prepar'd to plunge into the stream, he fears,<br/>
Not for himself, but for the charge he bears.<br/>
Anxious, he stops a while, and thinks in haste;<br/>
Then, desp'rate in distress, resolves at last.<br/>
A knotty lance of well-boil'd oak he bore;<br/>
The middle part with cork he cover'd o'er:<br/>
He clos'd the child within the hollow space;<br/>
With twigs of bending osier bound the case;<br/>
Then pois'd the spear, heavy with human weight,<br/>
And thus invok'd my favour for the freight:<br/>
'Accept, great goddess of the woods,' he said,<br/>
'Sent by her sire, this dedicated maid!<br/>
Thro' air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine;<br/>
And the first weapons that she knows, are thine.'<br/>
He said; and with full force the spear he threw:<br/>
Above the sounding waves Camilla flew.<br/>
Then, press'd by foes, he stemm'd the stormy tide,<br/>
And gain'd, by stress of arms, the farther side.<br/>
His fasten'd spear he pull'd from out the ground,<br/>
And, victor of his vows, his infant nymph unbound;<br/>
Nor, after that, in towns which walls inclose,<br/>
Would trust his hunted life amidst his foes;<br/>
But, rough, in open air he chose to lie;<br/>
Earth was his couch, his cov'ring was the sky.<br/>
On hills unshorn, or in a desert den,<br/>
He shunn'd the dire society of men.<br/>
A shepherd's solitary life he led;<br/>
His daughter with the milk of mares he fed.<br/>
The dugs of bears, and ev'ry salvage beast,<br/>
He drew, and thro' her lips the liquor press'd.<br/>
The little Amazon could scarcely go:<br/>
He loads her with a quiver and a bow;<br/>
And, that she might her stagg'ring steps command,<br/>
He with a slender jav'lin fills her hand.<br/>
Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound;<br/>
Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground.<br/>
Instead of these, a tiger's hide o'erspread<br/>
Her back and shoulders, fasten'd to her head.<br/>
The flying dart she first attempts to fling,<br/>
And round her tender temples toss'd the sling;<br/>
Then, as her strength with years increas'd, began<br/>
To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan,<br/>
And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane.<br/>
The Tuscan matrons with each other vied,<br/>
To bless their rival sons with such a bride;<br/>
But she disdains their love, to share with me<br/>
The sylvan shades and vow'd virginity.<br/>
And, O! I wish, contented with my cares<br/>
Of salvage spoils, she had not sought the wars!<br/>
Then had she been of my celestial train,<br/>
And shunn'd the fate that dooms her to be slain.<br/>
But since, opposing Heav'n's decree, she goes<br/>
To find her death among forbidden foes,<br/>
Haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight.<br/>
Where, with the gods, averse, the Latins fight.<br/>
This bow to thee, this quiver I bequeath,<br/>
This chosen arrow, to revenge her death:<br/>
By whate'er hand Camilla shall be slain,<br/>
Or of the Trojan or Italian train,<br/>
Let him not pass unpunish'd from the plain.<br/>
Then, in a hollow cloud, myself will aid<br/>
To bear the breathless body of my maid:<br/>
Unspoil'd shall be her arms, and unprofan'd<br/>
Her holy limbs with any human hand,<br/>
And in a marble tomb laid in her native land."
</p>
<p>
She said. The faithful nymph descends from high<br/>
With rapid flight, and cuts the sounding sky:<br/>
Black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly.
</p>
<p>
By this, the Trojan and the Tuscan horse,<br/>
Drawn up in squadrons, with united force,<br/>
Approach the walls: the sprightly coursers bound,<br/>
Press forward on their bits, and shift their ground.<br/>
Shields, arms, and spears flash horribly from far;<br/>
And the fields glitter with a waving war.<br/>
Oppos'd to these, come on with furious force<br/>
Messapus, Coras, and the Latian horse;<br/>
These in the body plac'd, on either hand<br/>
Sustain'd and clos'd by fair Camilla's band.<br/>
Advancing in a line, they couch their spears;<br/>
And less and less the middle space appears.<br/>
Thick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are seen<br/>
The neighing coursers, and the shouting men.<br/>
In distance of their darts they stop their course;<br/>
Then man to man they rush, and horse to horse.<br/>
The face of heav'n their flying jav'lins hide,<br/>
And deaths unseen are dealt on either side.<br/>
Tyrrhenus, and Aconteus, void of fear,<br/>
By mettled coursers borne in full career,<br/>
Meet first oppos'd; and, with a mighty shock,<br/>
Their horses' heads against each other knock.<br/>
Far from his steed is fierce Aconteus cast,<br/>
As with an engine's force, or lightning's blast:<br/>
He rolls along in blood, and breathes his last.<br/>
The Latin squadrons take a sudden fright,<br/>
And sling their shields behind, to save their backs in flight<br/>
Spurring at speed to their own walls they drew;<br/>
Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue,<br/>
And urge their flight: Asylas leads the chase;<br/>
Till, seiz'd, with shame, they wheel about and face,<br/>
Receive their foes, and raise a threat'ning cry.<br/>
The Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly.<br/>
So swelling surges, with a thund'ring roar,<br/>
Driv'n on each other's backs, insult the shore,<br/>
Bound o'er the rocks, incroach upon the land,<br/>
And far upon the beach eject the sand;<br/>
Then backward, with a swing, they take their way,<br/>
Repuls'd from upper ground, and seek their mother sea;<br/>
With equal hurry quit th' invaded shore,<br/>
And swallow back the sand and stones they spew'd before.
</p>
<p>
Twice were the Tuscans masters of the field,<br/>
Twice by the Latins, in their turn, repell'd.<br/>
Asham'd at length, to the third charge they ran;<br/>
Both hosts resolv'd, and mingled man to man.<br/>
Now dying groans are heard; the fields are strow'd<br/>
With falling bodies, and are drunk with blood.<br/>
Arms, horses, men, on heaps together lie:<br/>
Confus'd the fight, and more confus'd the cry.<br/>
Orsilochus, who durst not press too near<br/>
Strong Remulus, at distance drove his spear,<br/>
And stuck the steel beneath his horse's ear.<br/>
The fiery steed, impatient of the wound,<br/>
Curvets, and, springing upward with a bound,<br/>
His helpless lord cast backward on the ground.<br/>
Catillus pierc'd Iolas first; then drew<br/>
His reeking lance, and at Herminius threw,<br/>
The mighty champion of the Tuscan crew.<br/>
His neck and throat unarm'd, his head was bare,<br/>
But shaded with a length of yellow hair:<br/>
Secure, he fought, expos'd on ev'ry part,<br/>
A spacious mark for swords, and for the flying dart.<br/>
Across the shoulders came the feather'd wound;<br/>
Transfix'd he fell, and doubled to the ground.<br/>
The sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed,<br/>
And death with honour sought on either side.
</p>
<p>
Resistless thro' the war Camilla rode,<br/>
In danger unappall'd, and pleas'd with blood.<br/>
One side was bare for her exerted breast;<br/>
One shoulder with her painted quiver press'd.<br/>
Now from afar her fatal jav'lins play;<br/>
Now with her ax's edge she hews her way:<br/>
Diana's arms upon her shoulder sound;<br/>
And when, too closely press'd, she quits the ground,<br/>
From her bent bow she sends a backward wound.<br/>
Her maids, in martial pomp, on either side,<br/>
Larina, Tulla, fierce Tarpeia, ride:<br/>
Italians all; in peace, their queen's delight;<br/>
In war, the bold companions of the fight.<br/>
So march'd the Thracian Amazons of old,<br/>
When Thermodon with bloody billows roll'd:<br/>
Such troops as these in shining arms were seen,<br/>
When Theseus met in fight their maiden queen:<br/>
Such to the field Penthesilea led,<br/>
From the fierce virgin when the Grecians fled;<br/>
With such, return'd triumphant from the war,<br/>
Her maids with cries attend the lofty car;<br/>
They clash with manly force their moony shields;<br/>
With female shouts resound the Phrygian fields.
</p>
<p>
Who foremost, and who last, heroic maid,<br/>
On the cold earth were by thy courage laid?<br/>
Thy spear, of mountain ash, Eumenius first,<br/>
With fury driv'n, from side to side transpierc'd:<br/>
A purple stream came spouting from the wound;<br/>
Bath'd in his blood he lies, and bites the ground.<br/>
Liris and Pegasus at once she slew:<br/>
The former, as the slacken'd reins he drew<br/>
Of his faint steed; the latter, as he stretch'd<br/>
His arm to prop his friend, the jav'lin reach'd.<br/>
By the same weapon, sent from the same hand,<br/>
Both fall together, and both spurn the sand.<br/>
Amastrus next is added to the slain:<br/>
The rest in rout she follows o'er the plain:<br/>
Tereus, Harpalycus, Demophoon,<br/>
And Chromis, at full speed her fury shun.<br/>
Of all her deadly darts, not one she lost;<br/>
Each was attended with a Trojan ghost.<br/>
Young Ornithus bestrode a hunter steed,<br/>
Swift for the chase, and of Apulian breed.<br/>
Him from afar she spied, in arms unknown:<br/>
O'er his broad back an ox's hide was thrown;<br/>
His helm a wolf, whose gaping jaws were spread<br/>
A cov'ring for his cheeks, and grinn'd around his head,<br/>
He clench'd within his hand an iron prong,<br/>
And tower'd above the rest, conspicuous in the throng.<br/>
Him soon she singled from the flying train,<br/>
And slew with ease; then thus insults the slain:<br/>
"Vain hunter, didst thou think thro' woods to chase<br/>
The savage herd, a vile and trembling race?<br/>
Here cease thy vaunts, and own my victory:<br/>
A woman warrior was too strong for thee.<br/>
Yet, if the ghosts demand the conqu'ror's name,<br/>
Confessing great Camilla, save thy shame."<br/>
Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew,<br/>
The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew;<br/>
But Butes breast to breast: the spear descends<br/>
Above the gorget, where his helmet ends,<br/>
And o'er the shield which his left side defends.<br/>
Orsilochus and she their courses ply:<br/>
He seems to follow, and she seems to fly;<br/>
But in a narrower ring she makes the race;<br/>
And then he flies, and she pursues the chase.<br/>
Gath'ring at length on her deluded foe,<br/>
She swings her ax, and rises to the blow<br/>
Full on the helm behind, with such a sway<br/>
The weapon falls, the riven steel gives way:<br/>
He groans, he roars, he sues in vain for grace;<br/>
Brains, mingled with his blood, besmear his face.
</p>
<p>
Astonish'd Aunus just arrives by chance,<br/>
To see his fall; nor farther dares advance;<br/>
But, fixing on the horrid maid his eye,<br/>
He stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly;<br/>
Yet, like a true Ligurian, born to cheat,<br/>
(At least while fortune favour'd his deceit,)<br/>
Cries out aloud: "What courage have you shown,<br/>
Who trust your courser's strength, and not your own?<br/>
Forego the vantage of your horse, alight,<br/>
And then on equal terms begin the fight:<br/>
It shall be seen, weak woman, what you can,<br/>
When, foot to foot, you combat with a man,"<br/>
He said. She glows with anger and disdain,<br/>
Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain,<br/>
And leaves her horse at large among her train;<br/>
With her drawn sword defies him to the field,<br/>
And, marching, lifts aloft her maiden shield.<br/>
The youth, who thought his cunning did succeed,<br/>
Reins round his horse, and urges all his speed;<br/>
Adds the remembrance of the spur, and hides<br/>
The goring rowels in his bleeding sides.<br/>
"Vain fool, and coward!" cries the lofty maid,<br/>
"Caught in the train which thou thyself hast laid!<br/>
On others practice thy Ligurian arts;<br/>
Thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts<br/>
Are lost on me: nor shalt thou safe retire,<br/>
With vaunting lies, to thy fallacious sire."<br/>
At this, so fast her flying feet she sped,<br/>
That soon she strain'd beyond his horse's head:<br/>
Then turning short, at once she seiz'd the rein,<br/>
And laid the boaster grov'ling on the plain.<br/>
Not with more ease the falcon, from above,<br/>
Trusses in middle air the trembling dove,<br/>
Then plumes the prey, in her strong pounces bound:<br/>
The feathers, foul with blood, come tumbling to the ground.
</p>
<p>
Now mighty Jove, from his superior height,<br/>
With his broad eye surveys th' unequal fight.<br/>
He fires the breast of Tarchon with disdain,<br/>
And sends him to redeem th' abandon'd plain.<br/>
Betwixt the broken ranks the Tuscan rides,<br/>
And these encourages, and those he chides;<br/>
Recalls each leader, by his name, from flight;<br/>
Renews their ardour, and restores the fight.<br/>
"What panic fear has seiz'd your souls? O shame,<br/>
O brand perpetual of th' Etrurian name!<br/>
Cowards incurable, a woman's hand<br/>
Drives, breaks, and scatters your ignoble band!<br/>
Now cast away the sword, and quit the shield!<br/>
What use of weapons which you dare not wield?<br/>
Not thus you fly your female foes by night,<br/>
Nor shun the feast, when the full bowls invite;<br/>
When to fat off'rings the glad augur calls,<br/>
And the shrill hornpipe sounds to bacchanals.<br/>
These are your studied cares, your lewd delight:<br/>
Swift to debauch, but slow to manly fight."<br/>
Thus having said, he spurs amid the foes,<br/>
Not managing the life he meant to lose.<br/>
The first he found he seiz'd with headlong haste,<br/>
In his strong gripe, and clasp'd around the waist;<br/>
'Twas Venulus, whom from his horse he tore,<br/>
And, laid athwart his own, in triumph bore.<br/>
Loud shouts ensue; the Latins turn their eyes,<br/>
And view th' unusual sight with vast surprise.<br/>
The fiery Tarchon, flying o'er the plains,<br/>
Press'd in his arms the pond'rous prey sustains;<br/>
Then, with his shorten'd spear, explores around<br/>
His jointed arms, to fix a deadly wound.<br/>
Nor less the captive struggles for his life:<br/>
He writhes his body to prolong the strife,<br/>
And, fencing for his naked throat, exerts<br/>
His utmost vigour, and the point averts.<br/>
So stoops the yellow eagle from on high,<br/>
And bears a speckled serpent thro' the sky,<br/>
Fast'ning his crooked talons on the prey:<br/>
The pris'ner hisses thro' the liquid way;<br/>
Resists the royal hawk; and, tho' oppress'd,<br/>
She fights in volumes, and erects her crest:<br/>
Turn'd to her foe, she stiffens ev'ry scale,<br/>
And shoots her forky tongue, and whisks her threat'ning tail.<br/>
Against the victor, all defence is weak:<br/>
Th' imperial bird still plies her with his beak;<br/>
He tears her bowels, and her breast he gores;<br/>
Then claps his pinions, and securely soars.<br/>
Thus, thro' the midst of circling enemies,<br/>
Strong Tarchon snatch'd and bore away his prize.<br/>
The Tyrrhene troops, that shrunk before, now press<br/>
The Latins, and presume the like success.
</p>
<p>
Then Aruns, doom'd to death, his arts assay'd,<br/>
To murder, unespied, the Volscian maid:<br/>
This way and that his winding course he bends,<br/>
And, whereso'er she turns, her steps attends.<br/>
When she retires victorious from the chase,<br/>
He wheels about with care, and shifts his place;<br/>
When, rushing on, she seeks her foes in fight,<br/>
He keeps aloof, but keeps her still in sight:<br/>
He threats, and trembles, trying ev'ry way,<br/>
Unseen to kill, and safely to betray.<br/>
Chloreus, the priest of Cybele, from far,<br/>
Glitt'ring in Phrygian arms amidst the war,<br/>
Was by the virgin view'd. The steed he press'd<br/>
Was proud with trappings, and his brawny chest<br/>
With scales of gilded brass was cover'd o'er;<br/>
A robe of Tyrian dye the rider wore.<br/>
With deadly wounds he gall'd the distant foe;<br/>
Gnossian his shafts, and Lycian was his bow:<br/>
A golden helm his front and head surrounds<br/>
A gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds.<br/>
Gold, weav'd with linen, on his thighs he wore,<br/>
With flowers of needlework distinguish'd o'er,<br/>
With golden buckles bound, and gather'd up before.<br/>
Him the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes,<br/>
Fond and ambitious of so rich a prize,<br/>
Or that the temple might his trophies hold,<br/>
Or else to shine herself in Trojan gold.<br/>
Blind in her haste, she chases him alone.<br/>
And seeks his life, regardless of her own.
</p>
<p>
This lucky moment the sly traitor chose:<br/>
Then, starting from his ambush, up he rose,<br/>
And threw, but first to Heav'n address'd his vows:<br/>
"O patron of Socrates' high abodes,<br/>
Phoebus, the ruling pow'r among the gods,<br/>
Whom first we serve, whole woods of unctuous pine<br/>
Are fell'd for thee, and to thy glory shine;<br/>
By thee protected with our naked soles,<br/>
Thro' flames unsing'd we march, and tread the kindled coals<br/>
Give me, propitious pow'r, to wash away<br/>
The stains of this dishonourable day:<br/>
Nor spoils, nor triumph, from the fact I claim,<br/>
But with my future actions trust my fame.<br/>
Let me, by stealth, this female plague o'ercome,<br/>
And from the field return inglorious home."<br/>
Apollo heard, and, granting half his pray'r,<br/>
Shuffled in winds the rest, and toss'd in empty air.<br/>
He gives the death desir'd; his safe return<br/>
By southern tempests to the seas is borne.
</p>
<p>
Now, when the jav'lin whizz'd along the skies,<br/>
Both armies on Camilla turn'd their eyes,<br/>
Directed by the sound. Of either host,<br/>
Th' unhappy virgin, tho' concern'd the most,<br/>
Was only deaf; so greedy was she bent<br/>
On golden spoils, and on her prey intent;<br/>
Till in her pap the winged weapon stood<br/>
Infix'd, and deeply drunk the purple blood.<br/>
Her sad attendants hasten to sustain<br/>
Their dying lady, drooping on the plain.<br/>
Far from their sight the trembling Aruns flies,<br/>
With beating heart, and fear confus'd with joys;<br/>
Nor dares he farther to pursue his blow,<br/>
Or ev'n to bear the sight of his expiring foe.<br/>
As, when the wolf has torn a bullock's hide<br/>
At unawares, or ranch'd a shepherd's side,<br/>
Conscious of his audacious deed, he flies,<br/>
And claps his quiv'ring tail between his thighs:<br/>
So, speeding once, the wretch no more attends,<br/>
But, spurring forward, herds among his friends.
</p>
<p>
She wrench'd the jav'lin with her dying hands,<br/>
But wedg'd within her breast the weapon stands;<br/>
The wood she draws, the steely point remains;<br/>
She staggers in her seat with agonizing pains:<br/>
(A gath'ring mist o'erclouds her cheerful eyes,<br/>
And from her cheeks the rosy colour flies:)<br/>
Then turns to her, whom of her female train<br/>
She trusted most, and thus she speaks with pain:<br/>
"Acca, 'tis past! he swims before my sight,<br/>
Inexorable Death; and claims his right.<br/>
Bear my last words to Turnus; fly with speed,<br/>
And bid him timely to my charge succeed,<br/>
Repel the Trojans, and the town relieve:<br/>
Farewell! and in this kiss my parting breath receive."<br/>
She said, and, sliding, sunk upon the plain:<br/>
Dying, her open'd hand forsakes the rein;<br/>
Short, and more short, she pants; by slow degrees<br/>
Her mind the passage from her body frees.<br/>
She drops her sword; she nods her plumy crest,<br/>
Her drooping head declining on her breast:<br/>
In the last sigh her struggling soul expires,<br/>
And, murm'ring with disdain, to Stygian sounds retires.
</p>
<p>
A shout, that struck the golden stars, ensued;<br/>
Despair and rage the languish'd fight renew'd.<br/>
The Trojan troops and Tuscans, in a line,<br/>
Advance to charge; the mix'd Arcadians join.
</p>
<p>
But Cynthia's maid, high seated, from afar<br/>
Surveys the field, and fortune of the war,<br/>
Unmov'd a while, till, prostrate on the plain,<br/>
Welt'ring in blood, she sees Camilla slain,<br/>
And, round her corpse, of friends and foes a fighting train.<br/>
Then, from the bottom of her breast, she drew<br/>
A mournful sigh, and these sad words ensue:<br/>
"Too dear a fine, ah, much lamented maid,<br/>
For warring with the Trojans, thou hast paid!<br/>
Nor aught avail'd, in this unhappy strife,<br/>
Diana's sacred arms, to save thy life.<br/>
Yet unreveng'd thy goddess will not leave<br/>
Her vot'ry's death, nor; with vain sorrow grieve.<br/>
Branded the wretch, and be his name abhorr'd;<br/>
But after ages shall thy praise record.<br/>
Th' inglorious coward soon shall press the plain:<br/>
Thus vows thy queen, and thus the Fates ordain."
</p>
<p>
High o'er the field there stood a hilly mound,<br/>
Sacred the place, and spread with oaks around,<br/>
Where, in a marble tomb, Dercennus lay,<br/>
A king that once in Latium bore the sway.<br/>
The beauteous Opis thither bent her flight,<br/>
To mark the traitor Aruns from the height.<br/>
Him in refulgent arms she soon espied,<br/>
Swoln with success; and loudly thus she cried:<br/>
"Thy backward steps, vain boaster, are too late;<br/>
Turn like a man, at length, and meet thy fate.<br/>
Charg'd with my message, to Camilla go,<br/>
And say I sent thee to the shades below,<br/>
An honour undeserv'd from Cynthia's bow."
</p>
<p>
She said, and from her quiver chose with speed<br/>
The winged shaft, predestin'd for the deed;<br/>
Then to the stubborn yew her strength applied,<br/>
Till the far distant horns approach'd on either side.<br/>
The bowstring touch'd her breast, so strong she drew;<br/>
Whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew.<br/>
At once the twanging bow and sounding dart<br/>
The traitor heard, and felt the point within his heart.<br/>
Him, beating with his heels in pangs of death,<br/>
His flying friends to foreign fields bequeath.<br/>
The conqu'ring damsel, with expanded wings,<br/>
The welcome message to her mistress brings.
</p>
<p>
Their leader lost, the Volscians quit the field,<br/>
And, unsustain'd, the chiefs of Turnus yield.<br/>
The frighted soldiers, when their captains fly,<br/>
More on their speed than on their strength rely.<br/>
Confus'd in flight, they bear each other down,<br/>
And spur their horses headlong to the town.<br/>
Driv'n by their foes, and to their fears resign'd,<br/>
Not once they turn, but take their wounds behind.<br/>
These drop the shield, and those the lance forego,<br/>
Or on their shoulders bear the slacken'd bow.<br/>
The hoofs of horses, with a rattling sound,<br/>
Beat short and thick, and shake the rotten ground.<br/>
Black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky,<br/>
And o'er the darken'd walls and rampires fly.<br/>
The trembling matrons, from their lofty stands,<br/>
Rend heav'n with female shrieks, and wring their hands.<br/>
All pressing on, pursuers and pursued,<br/>
Are crush'd in crowds, a mingled multitude.<br/>
Some happy few escape: the throng too late<br/>
Rush on for entrance, till they choke the gate.<br/>
Ev'n in the sight of home, the wretched sire<br/>
Looks on, and sees his helpless son expire.<br/>
Then, in a fright, the folding gates they close,<br/>
But leave their friends excluded with their foes.<br/>
The vanquish'd cry; the victors loudly shout;<br/>
'Tis terror all within, and slaughter all without.<br/>
Blind in their fear, they bounce against the wall,<br/>
Or, to the moats pursued, precipitate their fall.
</p>
<p>
The Latian virgins, valiant with despair,<br/>
Arm'd on the tow'rs, the common danger share:<br/>
So much of zeal their country's cause inspir'd;<br/>
So much Camilla's great example fir'd.<br/>
Poles, sharpen'd in the flames, from high they throw,<br/>
With imitated darts, to gall the foe.<br/>
Their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath,<br/>
And crowd each other to be first in death.<br/>
Meantime to Turnus, ambush'd in the shade,<br/>
With heavy tidings came th' unhappy maid:<br/>
"The Volscians overthrown, Camilla kill'd;<br/>
The foes, entirely masters of the field,<br/>
Like a resistless flood, come rolling on:<br/>
The cry goes off the plain, and thickens to the town."
</p>
<p>
Inflam'd with rage, (for so the Furies fire<br/>
The Daunian's breast, and so the Fates require,)<br/>
He leaves the hilly pass, the woods in vain<br/>
Possess'd, and downward issues on the plain.<br/>
Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed<br/>
From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed.<br/>
Thro' the black forest and the ferny brake,<br/>
Unknowingly secure, their way they take;<br/>
From the rough mountains to the plain descend,<br/>
And there, in order drawn, their line extend.<br/>
Both armies now in open fields are seen;<br/>
Nor far the distance of the space between.<br/>
Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees,<br/>
Thro' smoking fields, his hast'ning enemies;<br/>
And Turnus views the Trojans in array,<br/>
And hears th' approaching horses proudly neigh.<br/>
Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join'd;<br/>
But westward to the sea the sun declin'd.<br/>
Intrench'd before the town both armies lie,<br/>
While night with sable wings involves the sky.

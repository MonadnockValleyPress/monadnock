<h1>Aeneid</h1>
<h2>by Virgil</h2>
<h3>Book IX</h3>
<p>
While these affairs in distant places pass'd,<br/>
The various Iris Juno sends with haste,<br/>
To find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought,<br/>
The secret shade of his great grandsire sought.<br/>
Retir'd alone she found the daring man,<br/>
And op'd her rosy lips, and thus began:<br/>
"What none of all the gods could grant thy vows,<br/>
That, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows.<br/>
Aeneas, gone to seek th' Arcadian prince,<br/>
Has left the Trojan camp without defence;<br/>
And, short of succours there, employs his pains<br/>
In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains.<br/>
Now snatch an hour that favours thy designs;<br/>
Unite thy forces, and attack their lines."<br/>
This said, on equal wings she pois'd her weight,<br/>
And form'd a radiant rainbow in her flight.
</p>
<p>
The Daunian hero lifts his hands and eyes,<br/>
And thus invokes the goddess as she flies:<br/>
"Iris, the grace of heav'n, what pow'r divine<br/>
Has sent thee down, thro' dusky clouds to shine?<br/>
See, they divide; immortal day appears,<br/>
And glitt'ring planets dancing in their spheres!<br/>
With joy, these happy omens I obey,<br/>
And follow to the war the god that leads the way."<br/>
Thus having said, as by the brook he stood,<br/>
He scoop'd the water from the crystal flood;<br/>
Then with his hands the drops to heav'n he throws,<br/>
And loads the pow'rs above with offer'd vows.
</p>
<p>
Now march the bold confed'rates thro' the plain,<br/>
Well hors'd, well clad; a rich and shining train.<br/>
Messapus leads the van; and, in the rear,<br/>
The sons of Tyrrheus in bright arms appear.<br/>
In the main battle, with his flaming crest,<br/>
The mighty Turnus tow'rs above the rest.<br/>
Silent they move, majestically slow,<br/>
Like ebbing Nile, or Ganges in his flow.<br/>
The Trojans view the dusty cloud from far,<br/>
And the dark menace of the distant war.<br/>
Caicus from the rampire saw it rise,<br/>
Black'ning the fields, and thick'ning thro' the skies.<br/>
Then to his fellows thus aloud he calls:<br/>
"What rolling clouds, my friends, approach the walls?<br/>
Arm! arm! and man the works! prepare your spears<br/>
And pointed darts! the Latian host appears."
</p>
<p>
Thus warn'd, they shut their gates; with shouts ascend<br/>
The bulwarks, and, secure, their foes attend:<br/>
For their wise gen'ral, with foreseeing care,<br/>
Had charg'd them not to tempt the doubtful war,<br/>
Nor, tho' provok'd, in open fields advance,<br/>
But close within their lines attend their chance.<br/>
Unwilling, yet they keep the strict command,<br/>
And sourly wait in arms the hostile band.<br/>
The fiery Turnus flew before the rest:<br/>
A piebald steed of Thracian strain he press'd;<br/>
His helm of massy gold, and crimson was his crest.<br/>
With twenty horse to second his designs,<br/>
An unexpected foe, he fac'd the lines.<br/>
"Is there," he said, "in arms, who bravely dare<br/>
His leader's honour and his danger share?"<br/>
Then spurring on, his brandish'd dart he threw,<br/>
In sign of war: applauding shouts ensue.
</p>
<p>
Amaz'd to find a dastard race, that run<br/>
Behind the rampires and the battle shun,<br/>
He rides around the camp, with rolling eyes,<br/>
And stops at ev'ry post, and ev'ry passage tries.<br/>
So roams the nightly wolf about the fold:<br/>
Wet with descending show'rs, and stiff with cold,<br/>
He howls for hunger, and he grins for pain,<br/>
(His gnashing teeth are exercis'd in vain,)<br/>
And, impotent of anger, finds no way<br/>
In his distended paws to grasp the prey.<br/>
The mothers listen; but the bleating lambs<br/>
Securely swig the dug, beneath the dams.<br/>
Thus ranges eager Turnus o'er the plain.<br/>
Sharp with desire, and furious with disdain;<br/>
Surveys each passage with a piercing sight,<br/>
To force his foes in equal field to fight.<br/>
Thus while he gazes round, at length he spies,<br/>
Where, fenc'd with strong redoubts, their navy lies,<br/>
Close underneath the walls; the washing tide<br/>
Secures from all approach this weaker side.<br/>
He takes the wish'd occasion, fills his hand<br/>
With ready fires, and shakes a flaming brand.<br/>
Urg'd by his presence, ev'ry soul is warm'd,<br/>
And ev'ry hand with kindled fires is arm'd.<br/>
From the fir'd pines the scatt'ring sparkles fly;<br/>
Fat vapours, mix'd with flames, involve the sky.<br/>
What pow'r, O Muses, could avert the flame<br/>
Which threaten'd, in the fleet, the Trojan name?<br/>
Tell: for the fact, thro' length of time obscure,<br/>
Is hard to faith; yet shall the fame endure.
</p>
<p>
'Tis said that, when the chief prepar'd his flight,<br/>
And fell'd his timber from Mount Ida's height,<br/>
The grandam goddess then approach'd her son,<br/>
And with a mother's majesty begun:<br/>
"Grant me," she said, "the sole request I bring,<br/>
Since conquer'd heav'n has own'd you for its king.<br/>
On Ida's brows, for ages past, there stood,<br/>
With firs and maples fill'd, a shady wood;<br/>
And on the summit rose a sacred grove,<br/>
Where I was worship'd with religious love.<br/>
Those woods, that holy grove, my long delight,<br/>
I gave the Trojan prince, to speed his flight.<br/>
Now, fill'd with fear, on their behalf I come;<br/>
Let neither winds o'erset, nor waves intomb<br/>
The floating forests of the sacred pine;<br/>
But let it be their safety to be mine."<br/>
Then thus replied her awful son, who rolls<br/>
The radiant stars, and heav'n and earth controls:<br/>
"How dare you, mother, endless date demand<br/>
For vessels moulded by a mortal hand?<br/>
What then is fate? Shall bold Aeneas ride,<br/>
Of safety certain, on th' uncertain tide?<br/>
Yet, what I can, I grant; when, wafted o'er,<br/>
The chief is landed on the Latian shore,<br/>
Whatever ships escape the raging storms,<br/>
At my command shall change their fading forms<br/>
To nymphs divine, and plow the wat'ry way,<br/>
Like Dotis and the daughters of the sea."<br/>
To seal his sacred vow, by Styx he swore,<br/>
The lake of liquid pitch, the dreary shore,<br/>
And Phlegethon's innavigable flood,<br/>
And the black regions of his brother god.<br/>
He said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod.
</p>
<p>
And now at length the number'd hours were come,<br/>
Prefix'd by fate's irrevocable doom,<br/>
When the great Mother of the Gods was free<br/>
To save her ships, and finish Jove's decree.<br/>
First, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung<br/>
A light that sign'd the heav'ns, and shot along;<br/>
Then from a cloud, fring'd round with golden fires,<br/>
Were timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs;<br/>
And, last, a voice, with more than mortal sounds,<br/>
Both hosts, in arms oppos'd, with equal horror wounds:<br/>
"O Trojan race, your needless aid forbear,<br/>
And know, my ships are my peculiar care.<br/>
With greater ease the bold Rutulian may,<br/>
With hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea,<br/>
Than singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge,<br/>
Loos'd from your crooked anchors, launch at large,<br/>
Exalted each a nymph: forsake the sand,<br/>
And swim the seas, at Cybele's command."<br/>
No sooner had the goddess ceas'd to speak,<br/>
When, lo! th' obedient ships their haulsers break;<br/>
And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main<br/>
They plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again:<br/>
As many beauteous maids the billows sweep,<br/>
As rode before tall vessels on the deep.
</p>
<p>
The foes, surpris'd with wonder, stood aghast;<br/>
Messapus curb'd his fiery courser's haste;<br/>
Old Tiber roar'd, and, raising up his head,<br/>
Call'd back his waters to their oozy bed.<br/>
Turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock,<br/>
And with these words his trembling troops bespoke:<br/>
"These monsters for the Trojans' fate are meant,<br/>
And are by Jove for black presages sent.<br/>
He takes the cowards' last relief away;<br/>
For fly they cannot, and, constrain'd to stay,<br/>
Must yield unfought, a base inglorious prey.<br/>
The liquid half of all the globe is lost;<br/>
Heav'n shuts the seas, and we secure the coast.<br/>
Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground<br/>
Which myriads of our martial men surround.<br/>
Their fates I fear not, or vain oracles.<br/>
'Twas giv'n to Venus they should cross the seas,<br/>
And land secure upon the Latian plains:<br/>
Their promis'd hour is pass'd, and mine remains.<br/>
'Tis in the fate of Turnus to destroy,<br/>
With sword and fire, the faithless race of Troy.<br/>
Shall such affronts as these alone inflame<br/>
The Grecian brothers, and the Grecian name?<br/>
My cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife,<br/>
And final ruin, for a ravish'd wife.<br/>
Was 't not enough, that, punish'd for the crime,<br/>
They fell; but will they fall a second time?<br/>
One would have thought they paid enough before,<br/>
To curse the costly sex, and durst offend no more.<br/>
Can they securely trust their feeble wall,<br/>
A slight partition, a thin interval,<br/>
Betwixt their fate and them; when Troy, tho' built<br/>
By hands divine, yet perish'd by their guilt?<br/>
Lend me, for once, my friends, your valiant hands,<br/>
To force from out their lines these dastard bands.<br/>
Less than a thousand ships will end this war,<br/>
Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare.<br/>
Let all the Tuscans, all th' Arcadians, join!<br/>
Nor these, nor those, shall frustrate my design.<br/>
Let them not fear the treasons of the night,<br/>
The robb'd Palladium, the pretended flight:<br/>
Our onset shall be made in open light.<br/>
No wooden engine shall their town betray;<br/>
Fires they shall have around, but fires by day.<br/>
No Grecian babes before their camp appear,<br/>
Whom Hector's arms detain'd to the tenth tardy year.<br/>
Now, since the sun is rolling to the west,<br/>
Give we the silent night to needful rest:<br/>
Refresh your bodies, and your arms prepare;<br/>
The morn shall end the small remains of war."
</p>
<p>
The post of honour to Messapus falls,<br/>
To keep the nightly guard, to watch the walls,<br/>
To pitch the fires at distances around,<br/>
And close the Trojans in their scanty ground.<br/>
Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand,<br/>
And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command;<br/>
All clad in shining arms the works invest,<br/>
Each with a radiant helm and waving crest.<br/>
Stretch'd at their length, they press the grassy ground;<br/>
They laugh, they sing, (the jolly bowls go round,)<br/>
With lights and cheerful fires renew the day,<br/>
And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play.
</p>
<p>
The Trojans, from above, their foes beheld,<br/>
And with arm'd legions all the rampires fill'd.<br/>
Seiz'd with affright, their gates they first explore;<br/>
Join works to works with bridges, tow'r to tow'r:<br/>
Thus all things needful for defence abound.<br/>
Mnestheus and brave Seresthus walk the round,<br/>
Commission'd by their absent prince to share<br/>
The common danger, and divide the care.<br/>
The soldiers draw their lots, and, as they fall,<br/>
By turns relieve each other on the wall.
</p>
<p>
Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance,<br/>
To watch the gate was warlike Nisus' chance.<br/>
His father Hyrtacus of noble blood;<br/>
His mother was a huntress of the wood,<br/>
And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear<br/>
His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear,<br/>
But better skill'd unerring shafts to send.<br/>
Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend:<br/>
Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host<br/>
No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast.<br/>
Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun.<br/>
One was their care, and their delight was one:<br/>
One common hazard in the war they shar'd,<br/>
And now were both by choice upon the guard.
</p>
<p>
Then Nisus thus: "Or do the gods inspire<br/>
This warmth, or make we gods of our desire?<br/>
A gen'rous ardour boils within my breast,<br/>
Eager of action, enemy to rest:<br/>
This urges me to fight, and fires my mind<br/>
To leave a memorable name behind.<br/>
Thou see'st the foe secure; how faintly shine<br/>
Their scatter'd fires! the most, in sleep supine<br/>
Along the ground, an easy conquest lie:<br/>
The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply;<br/>
All hush'd around. Now hear what I revolve—<br/>
A thought unripe—and scarcely yet resolve.<br/>
Our absent prince both camp and council mourn;<br/>
By message both would hasten his return:<br/>
If they confer what I demand on thee,<br/>
(For fame is recompense enough for me,)<br/>
Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied<br/>
A way that safely will my passage guide."
</p>
<p>
Euryalus stood list'ning while he spoke,<br/>
With love of praise and noble envy struck;<br/>
Then to his ardent friend expos'd his mind:<br/>
"All this, alone, and leaving me behind!<br/>
Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be join'd?<br/>
Think'st thou I can my share of glory yield,<br/>
Or send thee unassisted to the field?<br/>
Not so my father taught my childhood arms;<br/>
Born in a siege, and bred among alarms!<br/>
Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend,<br/>
Nor of the heav'n-born hero I attend.<br/>
The thing call'd life, with ease I can disclaim,<br/>
And think it over-sold to purchase fame."
</p>
<p>
Then Nisus thus: "Alas! thy tender years<br/>
Would minister new matter to my fears.<br/>
So may the gods, who view this friendly strife,<br/>
Restore me to thy lov'd embrace with life,<br/>
Condemn'd to pay my vows, (as sure I trust,)<br/>
This thy request is cruel and unjust.<br/>
But if some chance—as many chances are,<br/>
And doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war—<br/>
If one should reach my head, there let it fall,<br/>
And spare thy life; I would not perish all.<br/>
Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date:<br/>
Live thou to mourn thy love's unhappy fate;<br/>
To bear my mangled body from the foe,<br/>
Or buy it back, and fun'ral rites bestow.<br/>
Or, if hard fortune shall those dues deny,<br/>
Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply.<br/>
O let not me the widow's tears renew!<br/>
Nor let a mother's curse my name pursue:<br/>
Thy pious parent, who, for love of thee,<br/>
Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily,<br/>
Her age committing to the seas and wind,<br/>
When ev'ry weary matron stay'd behind."<br/>
To this, Euryalus: "You plead in vain,<br/>
And but protract the cause you cannot gain.<br/>
No more delays, but haste!" With that, he wakes<br/>
The nodding watch; each to his office takes.<br/>
The guard reliev'd, the gen'rous couple went<br/>
To find the council at the royal tent.
</p>
<p>
All creatures else forgot their daily care,<br/>
And sleep, the common gift of nature, share;<br/>
Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate<br/>
In nightly council for th' indanger'd state.<br/>
They vote a message to their absent chief,<br/>
Shew their distress, and beg a swift relief.<br/>
Amid the camp a silent seat they chose,<br/>
Remote from clamour, and secure from foes.<br/>
On their left arms their ample shields they bear,<br/>
The right reclin'd upon the bending spear.<br/>
Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard,<br/>
And beg admission, eager to be heard:<br/>
Th' affair important, not to be deferr'd.<br/>
Ascanius bids 'em be conducted in,<br/>
Ord'ring the more experienc'd to begin.<br/>
Then Nisus thus: "Ye fathers, lend your ears;<br/>
Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years.<br/>
The foe, securely drench'd in sleep and wine,<br/>
Neglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine;<br/>
And where the smoke in cloudy vapours flies,<br/>
Cov'ring the plain, and curling to the skies,<br/>
Betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide,<br/>
Close by the sea, a passage we have spied,<br/>
Which will our way to great Aeneas guide.<br/>
Expect each hour to see him safe again,<br/>
Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain.<br/>
Snatch we the lucky minute while we may;<br/>
Nor can we be mistaken in the way;<br/>
For, hunting in the vale, we both have seen<br/>
The rising turrets, and the stream between,<br/>
And know the winding course, with ev'ry ford."
</p>
<p>
He ceas'd; and old Alethes took the word:<br/>
"Our country gods, in whom our trust we place,<br/>
Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race,<br/>
While we behold such dauntless worth appear<br/>
In dawning youth, and souls so void of fear."<br/>
Then into tears of joy the father broke;<br/>
Each in his longing arms by turns he took;<br/>
Panted and paus'd; and thus again he spoke:<br/>
"Ye brave young men, what equal gifts can we,<br/>
In recompense of such desert, decree?<br/>
The greatest, sure, and best you can receive,<br/>
The gods and your own conscious worth will give.<br/>
The rest our grateful gen'ral will bestow,<br/>
And young Ascanius till his manhood owe."
</p>
<p>
"And I, whose welfare in my father lies,"<br/>
Ascanius adds, "by the great deities,<br/>
By my dear country, by my household gods,<br/>
By hoary Vesta's rites and dark abodes,<br/>
Adjure you both, (on you my fortune stands;<br/>
That and my faith I plight into your hands,)<br/>
Make me but happy in his safe return,<br/>
Whose wanted presence I can only mourn;<br/>
Your common gift shall two large goblets be<br/>
Of silver, wrought with curious imagery,<br/>
And high emboss'd, which, when old Priam reign'd,<br/>
My conqu'ring sire at sack'd Arisba gain'd;<br/>
And more, two tripods cast in antique mould,<br/>
With two great talents of the finest gold;<br/>
Beside a costly bowl, ingrav'd with art,<br/>
Which Dido gave, when first she gave her heart.<br/>
But, if in conquer'd Italy we reign,<br/>
When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain—<br/>
Thou saw'st the courser by proud Turnus press'd:<br/>
That, Nisus, and his arms, and nodding crest,<br/>
And shield, from chance exempt, shall be thy share:<br/>
Twelve lab'ring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair<br/>
All clad in rich attire, and train'd with care;<br/>
And, last, a Latian field with fruitful plains,<br/>
And a large portion of the king's domains.<br/>
But thou, whose years are more to mine allied,<br/>
No fate my vow'd affection shall divide<br/>
From thee, heroic youth! Be wholly mine;<br/>
Take full possession; all my soul is thine.<br/>
One faith, one fame, one fate, shall both attend;<br/>
My life's companion, and my bosom friend:<br/>
My peace shall be committed to thy care,<br/>
And to thy conduct my concerns in war."
</p>
<p>
Then thus the young Euryalus replied:<br/>
"Whatever fortune, good or bad, betide,<br/>
The same shall be my age, as now my youth;<br/>
No time shall find me wanting to my truth.<br/>
This only from your goodness let me gain<br/>
(And, this ungranted, all rewards are vain)<br/>
Of Priam's royal race my mother came—<br/>
And sure the best that ever bore the name—<br/>
Whom neither Troy nor Sicily could hold<br/>
From me departing, but, o'erspent and old,<br/>
My fate she follow'd. Ignorant of this<br/>
(Whatever) danger, neither parting kiss,<br/>
Nor pious blessing taken, her I leave,<br/>
And in this only act of all my life deceive.<br/>
By this right hand and conscious night I swear,<br/>
My soul so sad a farewell could not bear.<br/>
Be you her comfort; fill my vacant place<br/>
(Permit me to presume so great a grace)<br/>
Support her age, forsaken and distress'd.<br/>
That hope alone will fortify my breast<br/>
Against the worst of fortunes, and of fears."<br/>
He said. The mov'd assistants melt in tears.
</p>
<p>
Then thus Ascanius, wonderstruck to see<br/>
That image of his filial piety:<br/>
"So great beginnings, in so green an age,<br/>
Exact the faith which I again engage.<br/>
Thy mother all the dues shall justly claim,<br/>
Creusa had, and only want the name.<br/>
Whate'er event thy bold attempt shall have,<br/>
'Tis merit to have borne a son so brave.<br/>
Now by my head, a sacred oath, I swear,<br/>
(My father us'd it,) what, returning here<br/>
Crown'd with success, I for thyself prepare,<br/>
That, if thou fail, shall thy lov'd mother share."
</p>
<p>
He said, and weeping, while he spoke the word,<br/>
From his broad belt he drew a shining sword,<br/>
Magnificent with gold. Lycaon made,<br/>
And in an ivory scabbard sheath'd the blade.<br/>
This was his gift. Great Mnestheus gave his friend<br/>
A lion's hide, his body to defend;<br/>
And good Alethes furnish'd him, beside,<br/>
With his own trusty helm, of temper tried.
</p>
<p>
Thus arm'd they went. The noble Trojans wait<br/>
Their issuing forth, and follow to the gate<br/>
With prayers and vows. Above the rest appears<br/>
Ascanius, manly far beyond his years,<br/>
And messages committed to their care,<br/>
Which all in winds were lost, and flitting air.
</p>
<p>
The trenches first they pass'd; then took their way<br/>
Where their proud foes in pitch'd pavilions lay;<br/>
To many fatal, ere themselves were slain.<br/>
They found the careless host dispers'd upon the plain,<br/>
Who, gorg'd, and drunk with wine, supinely snore.<br/>
Unharness'd chariots stand along the shore:<br/>
Amidst the wheels and reins, the goblet by,<br/>
A medley of debauch and war, they lie.<br/>
Observing Nisus shew'd his friend the sight:<br/>
"Behold a conquest gain'd without a fight.<br/>
Occasion offers, and I stand prepar'd;<br/>
There lies our way; be thou upon the guard,<br/>
And look around, while I securely go,<br/>
And hew a passage thro' the sleeping foe."<br/>
Softly he spoke; then striding took his way,<br/>
With his drawn sword, where haughty Rhamnes lay;<br/>
His head rais'd high on tapestry beneath,<br/>
And heaving from his breast, he drew his breath;<br/>
A king and prophet, by King Turnus lov'd:<br/>
But fate by prescience cannot be remov'd.<br/>
Him and his sleeping slaves he slew; then spies<br/>
Where Remus, with his rich retinue, lies.<br/>
His armour-bearer first, and next he kills<br/>
His charioteer, intrench'd betwixt the wheels<br/>
And his lov'd horses; last invades their lord;<br/>
Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword:<br/>
The gasping head flies off; a purple flood<br/>
Flows from the trunk, that welters in the blood,<br/>
Which, by the spurning heels dispers'd around,<br/>
The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground.<br/>
Lamus the bold, and Lamyrus the strong,<br/>
He slew, and then Serranus fair and young.<br/>
From dice and wine the youth retir'd to rest,<br/>
And puff'd the fumy god from out his breast:<br/>
Ev'n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play—<br/>
More lucky, had it lasted till the day.<br/>
The famish'd lion thus, with hunger bold,<br/>
O'erleaps the fences of the nightly fold,<br/>
And tears the peaceful flocks: with silent awe<br/>
Trembling they lie, and pant beneath his paw.
</p>
<p>
Nor with less rage Euryalus employs<br/>
The wrathful sword, or fewer foes destroys;<br/>
But on th' ignoble crowd his fury flew;<br/>
He Fadus, Hebesus, and Rhoetus slew.<br/>
Oppress'd with heavy sleep the former fell,<br/>
But Rhoetus wakeful, and observing all:<br/>
Behind a spacious jar he slink'd for fear;<br/>
The fatal iron found and reach'd him there;<br/>
For, as he rose, it pierc'd his naked side,<br/>
And, reeking, thence return'd in crimson dyed.<br/>
The wound pours out a stream of wine and blood;<br/>
The purple soul comes floating in the flood.
</p>
<p>
Now, where Messapus quarter'd, they arrive.<br/>
The fires were fainting there, and just alive;<br/>
The warrior-horses, tied in order, fed.<br/>
Nisus observ'd the discipline, and said:<br/>
"Our eager thirst of blood may both betray;<br/>
And see the scatter'd streaks of dawning day,<br/>
Foe to nocturnal thefts. No more, my friend;<br/>
Here let our glutted execution end.<br/>
A lane thro' slaughter'd bodies we have made."<br/>
The bold Euryalus, tho' loth, obey'd.<br/>
Of arms, and arras, and of plate, they find<br/>
A precious load; but these they leave behind.<br/>
Yet, fond of gaudy spoils, the boy would stay<br/>
To make the rich caparison his prey,<br/>
Which on the steed of conquer'd Rhamnes lay.<br/>
Nor did his eyes less longingly behold<br/>
The girdle-belt, with nails of burnish'd gold.<br/>
This present Caedicus the rich bestow'd<br/>
On Remulus, when friendship first they vow'd,<br/>
And, absent, join'd in hospitable ties:<br/>
He, dying, to his heir bequeath'd the prize;<br/>
Till, by the conqu'ring Ardean troops oppress'd,<br/>
He fell; and they the glorious gift possess'd.<br/>
These glitt'ring spoils (now made the victor's gain)<br/>
He to his body suits, but suits in vain:<br/>
Messapus' helm he finds among the rest,<br/>
And laces on, and wears the waving crest.<br/>
Proud of their conquest, prouder of their prey,<br/>
They leave the camp, and take the ready way.
</p>
<p>
But far they had not pass'd, before they spied<br/>
Three hundred horse, with Volscens for their guide.<br/>
The queen a legion to King Turnus sent;<br/>
But the swift horse the slower foot prevent,<br/>
And now, advancing, sought the leader's tent.<br/>
They saw the pair; for, thro' the doubtful shade,<br/>
His shining helm Euryalus betray'd,<br/>
On which the moon with full reflection play'd.<br/>
"'Tis not for naught," cried Volscens from the crowd,<br/>
"These men go there;" then rais'd his voice aloud:<br/>
"Stand! stand! why thus in arms? And whither bent?<br/>
From whence, to whom, and on what errand sent?"<br/>
Silent they scud away, and haste their flight<br/>
To neighb'ring woods, and trust themselves to night.<br/>
The speedy horse all passages belay,<br/>
And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way,<br/>
And watch each entrance of the winding wood.<br/>
Black was the forest: thick with beech it stood,<br/>
Horrid with fern, and intricate with thorn;<br/>
Few paths of human feet, or tracks of beasts, were worn.<br/>
The darkness of the shades, his heavy prey,<br/>
And fear, misled the younger from his way.<br/>
But Nisus hit the turns with happier haste,<br/>
And, thoughtless of his friend, the forest pass'd,<br/>
And Alban plains, from Alba's name so call'd,<br/>
Where King Latinus then his oxen stall'd;<br/>
Till, turning at the length, he stood his ground,<br/>
And miss'd his friend, and cast his eyes around:<br/>
"Ah wretch!" he cried, "where have I left behind<br/>
Th' unhappy youth? where shall I hope to find?<br/>
Or what way take?" Again he ventures back,<br/>
And treads the mazes of his former track.<br/>
He winds the wood, and, list'ning, hears the noise<br/>
Of tramping coursers, and the riders' voice.<br/>
The sound approach'd; and suddenly he view'd<br/>
The foes inclosing, and his friend pursued,<br/>
Forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain<br/>
The shelter of the friendly shades to gain.<br/>
What should he next attempt? what arms employ,<br/>
What fruitless force, to free the captive boy?<br/>
Or desperate should he rush and lose his life,<br/>
With odds oppress'd, in such unequal strife?
</p>
<p>
Resolv'd at length, his pointed spear he shook;<br/>
And, casting on the moon a mournful look:<br/>
"Guardian of groves, and goddess of the night,<br/>
Fair queen," he said, "direct my dart aright.<br/>
If e'er my pious father, for my sake,<br/>
Did grateful off'rings on thy altars make,<br/>
Or I increas'd them with my sylvan toils,<br/>
And hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils,<br/>
Give me to scatter these." Then from his ear<br/>
He pois'd, and aim'd, and launch'd the trembling spear.<br/>
The deadly weapon, hissing from the grove,<br/>
Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove;<br/>
Pierc'd his thin armour, drank his vital blood,<br/>
And in his body left the broken wood.<br/>
He staggers round; his eyeballs roll in death,<br/>
And with short sobs he gasps away his breath.<br/>
All stand amaz'd—a second jav'lin flies<br/>
With equal strength, and quivers thro' the skies.<br/>
This thro' thy temples, Tagus, forc'd the way,<br/>
And in the brainpan warmly buried lay.<br/>
Fierce Volscens foams with rage, and, gazing round,<br/>
Descried not him who gave the fatal wound,<br/>
Nor knew to fix revenge: "But thou," he cries,<br/>
"Shalt pay for both," and at the pris'ner flies<br/>
With his drawn sword. Then, struck with deep despair,<br/>
That cruel sight the lover could not bear;<br/>
But from his covert rush'd in open view,<br/>
And sent his voice before him as he flew:<br/>
"Me! me!" he cried—"turn all your swords alone<br/>
On me—the fact confess'd, the fault my own.<br/>
He neither could nor durst, the guiltless youth:<br/>
Ye moon and stars, bear witness to the truth!<br/>
His only crime (if friendship can offend)<br/>
Is too much love to his unhappy friend."<br/>
Too late he speaks: the sword, which fury guides,<br/>
Driv'n with full force, had pierc'd his tender sides.<br/>
Down fell the beauteous youth: the yawning wound<br/>
Gush'd out a purple stream, and stain'd the ground.<br/>
His snowy neck reclines upon his breast,<br/>
Like a fair flow'r by the keen share oppress'd;<br/>
Like a white poppy sinking on the plain,<br/>
Whose heavy head is overcharg'd with rain.<br/>
Despair, and rage, and vengeance justly vow'd,<br/>
Drove Nisus headlong on the hostile crowd.<br/>
Volscens he seeks; on him alone he bends:<br/>
Borne back and bor'd by his surrounding friends,<br/>
Onward he press'd, and kept him still in sight;<br/>
Then whirl'd aloft his sword with all his might:<br/>
Th' unerring steel descended while he spoke,<br/>
Pierc'd his wide mouth, and thro' his weazon broke.<br/>
Dying, he slew; and, stagg'ring on the plain,<br/>
With swimming eyes he sought his lover slain;<br/>
Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell,<br/>
Content, in death, to be reveng'd so well.
</p>
<p>
O happy friends! for, if my verse can give<br/>
Immortal life, your fame shall ever live,<br/>
Fix'd as the Capitol's foundation lies,<br/>
And spread, where'er the Roman eagle flies!
</p>
<p>
The conqu'ring party first divide the prey,<br/>
Then their slain leader to the camp convey.<br/>
With wonder, as they went, the troops were fill'd,<br/>
To see such numbers whom so few had kill'd.<br/>
Serranus, Rhamnes, and the rest, they found:<br/>
Vast crowds the dying and the dead surround;<br/>
And the yet reeking blood o'erflows the ground.<br/>
All knew the helmet which Messapus lost,<br/>
But mourn'd a purchase that so dear had cost.<br/>
Now rose the ruddy morn from Tithon's bed,<br/>
And with the dawn of day the skies o'erspread;<br/>
Nor long the sun his daily course withheld,<br/>
But added colours to the world reveal'd:<br/>
When early Turnus, wak'ning with the light,<br/>
All clad in armour, calls his troops to fight.<br/>
His martial men with fierce harangue he fir'd,<br/>
And his own ardour in their souls inspir'd.<br/>
This done—to give new terror to his foes,<br/>
The heads of Nisus and his friend he shows,<br/>
Rais'd high on pointed spears—a ghastly sight:<br/>
Loud peals of shouts ensue, and barbarous delight.
</p>
<p>
Meantime the Trojans run, where danger calls;<br/>
They line their trenches, and they man their walls.<br/>
In front extended to the left they stood;<br/>
Safe was the right, surrounded by the flood.<br/>
But, casting from their tow'rs a frightful view,<br/>
They saw the faces, which too well they knew,<br/>
Tho' then disguis'd in death, and smear'd all o'er<br/>
With filth obscene, and dropping putrid gore.<br/>
Soon hasty fame thro' the sad city bears<br/>
The mournful message to the mother's ears.<br/>
An icy cold benumbs her limbs; she shakes;<br/>
Her cheeks the blood, her hand the web forsakes.<br/>
She runs the rampires round amidst the war,<br/>
Nor fears the flying darts; she rends her hair,<br/>
And fills with loud laments the liquid air.<br/>
"Thus, then, my lov'd Euryalus appears!<br/>
Thus looks the prop of my declining years!<br/>
Was't on this face my famish'd eyes I fed?<br/>
Ah! how unlike the living is the dead!<br/>
And could'st thou leave me, cruel, thus alone?<br/>
Not one kind kiss from a departing son!<br/>
No look, no last adieu before he went,<br/>
In an ill-boding hour to slaughter sent!<br/>
Cold on the ground, and pressing foreign clay,<br/>
To Latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey!<br/>
Nor was I near to close his dying eyes,<br/>
To wash his wounds, to weep his obsequies,<br/>
To call about his corpse his crying friends,<br/>
Or spread the mantle (made for other ends)<br/>
On his dear body, which I wove with care,<br/>
Nor did my daily pains or nightly labour spare.<br/>
Where shall I find his corpse? what earth sustains<br/>
His trunk dismember'd, and his cold remains?<br/>
For this, alas! I left my needful ease,<br/>
Expos'd my life to winds and winter seas!<br/>
If any pity touch Rutulian hearts,<br/>
Here empty all your quivers, all your darts;<br/>
Or, if they fail, thou, Jove, conclude my woe,<br/>
And send me thunderstruck to shades below!"<br/>
Her shrieks and clamours pierce the Trojans' ears,<br/>
Unman their courage, and augment their fears;<br/>
Nor young Ascanius could the sight sustain,<br/>
Nor old Ilioneus his tears restrain,<br/>
But Actor and Idaeus jointly sent,<br/>
To bear the madding mother to her tent.
</p>
<p>
And now the trumpets terribly, from far,<br/>
With rattling clangour, rouse the sleepy war.<br/>
The soldiers' shouts succeed the brazen sounds;<br/>
And heav'n, from pole to pole, the noise rebounds.<br/>
The Volscians bear their shields upon their head,<br/>
And, rushing forward, form a moving shed.<br/>
These fill the ditch; those pull the bulwarks down:<br/>
Some raise the ladders; others scale the town.<br/>
But, where void spaces on the walls appear,<br/>
Or thin defence, they pour their forces there.<br/>
With poles and missive weapons, from afar,<br/>
The Trojans keep aloof the rising war.<br/>
Taught, by their ten years' siege, defensive fight,<br/>
They roll down ribs of rocks, an unresisted weight,<br/>
To break the penthouse with the pond'rous blow,<br/>
Which yet the patient Volscians undergo:<br/>
But could not bear th' unequal combat long;<br/>
For, where the Trojans find the thickest throng,<br/>
The ruin falls: their shatter'd shields give way,<br/>
And their crush'd heads become an easy prey.<br/>
They shrink for fear, abated of their rage,<br/>
Nor longer dare in a blind fight engage;<br/>
Contented now to gall them from below<br/>
With darts and slings, and with the distant bow.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere Mezentius, terrible to view,<br/>
A blazing pine within the trenches threw.<br/>
But brave Messapus, Neptune's warlike son,<br/>
Broke down the palisades, the trenches won,<br/>
And loud for ladders calls, to scale the town.
</p>
<p>
Calliope, begin! Ye sacred Nine,<br/>
Inspire your poet in his high design,<br/>
To sing what slaughter manly Turnus made,<br/>
What souls he sent below the Stygian shade,<br/>
What fame the soldiers with their captain share,<br/>
And the vast circuit of the fatal war;<br/>
For you in singing martial facts excel;<br/>
You best remember, and alone can tell.
</p>
<p>
There stood a tow'r, amazing to the sight,<br/>
Built up of beams, and of stupendous height:<br/>
Art, and the nature of the place, conspir'd<br/>
To furnish all the strength that war requir'd.<br/>
To level this, the bold Italians join;<br/>
The wary Trojans obviate their design;<br/>
With weighty stones o'erwhelm their troops below,<br/>
Shoot thro' the loopholes, and sharp jav'lins throw.<br/>
Turnus, the chief, toss'd from his thund'ring hand<br/>
Against the wooden walls, a flaming brand:<br/>
It stuck, the fiery plague; the winds were high;<br/>
The planks were season'd, and the timber dry.<br/>
Contagion caught the posts; it spread along,<br/>
Scorch'd, and to distance drove the scatter'd throng.<br/>
The Trojans fled; the fire pursued amain,<br/>
Still gath'ring fast upon the trembling train;<br/>
Till, crowding to the corners of the wall,<br/>
Down the defence and the defenders fall.<br/>
The mighty flaw makes heav'n itself resound:<br/>
The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground.<br/>
The tow'r, that follow'd on the fallen crew,<br/>
Whelm'd o'er their heads, and buried whom it slew:<br/>
Some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent;<br/>
All the same equal ruin underwent.
</p>
<p>
Young Lycus and Helenor only scape;<br/>
Sav'd—how, they know not—from the steepy leap.<br/>
Helenor, elder of the two: by birth,<br/>
On one side royal, one a son of earth,<br/>
Whom to the Lydian king Licymnia bare,<br/>
And sent her boasted bastard to the war<br/>
(A privilege which none but freemen share).<br/>
Slight were his arms, a sword and silver shield:<br/>
No marks of honour charg'd its empty field.<br/>
Light as he fell, so light the youth arose,<br/>
And rising, found himself amidst his foes;<br/>
Nor flight was left, nor hopes to force his way.<br/>
Embolden'd by despair, he stood at bay;<br/>
And, like a stag, whom all the troop surrounds<br/>
Of eager huntsmen and invading hounds<br/>
Resolv'd on death, he dissipates his fears,<br/>
And bounds aloft against the pointed spears:<br/>
So dares the youth, secure of death; and throws<br/>
His dying body on his thickest foes.<br/>
But Lycus, swifter of his feet by far,<br/>
Runs, doubles, winds and turns, amidst the war;<br/>
Springs to the walls, and leaves his foes behind,<br/>
And snatches at the beam he first can find;<br/>
Looks up, and leaps aloft at all the stretch,<br/>
In hopes the helping hand of some kind friend to reach.<br/>
But Turnus follow'd hard his hunted prey<br/>
(His spear had almost reach'd him in the way,<br/>
Short of his reins, and scarce a span behind)<br/>
"Fool!" said the chief, "tho' fleeter than the wind,<br/>
Couldst thou presume to scape, when I pursue?"<br/>
He said, and downward by the feet he drew<br/>
The trembling dastard; at the tug he falls;<br/>
Vast ruins come along, rent from the smoking walls.<br/>
Thus on some silver swan, or tim'rous hare,<br/>
Jove's bird comes sousing down from upper air;<br/>
Her crooked talons truss the fearful prey:<br/>
Then out of sight she soars, and wings her way.<br/>
So seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb,<br/>
In vain lamented by the bleating dam.
</p>
<p>
Then rushing onward with a barb'rous cry,<br/>
The troops of Turnus to the combat fly.<br/>
The ditch with fagots fill'd, the daring foe<br/>
Toss'd firebrands to the steepy turrets throw.
</p>
<p>
Ilioneus, as bold Lucetius came<br/>
To force the gate, and feed the kindling flame,<br/>
Roll'd down the fragment of a rock so right,<br/>
It crush'd him double underneath the weight.<br/>
Two more young Liger and Asylas slew:<br/>
To bend the bow young Liger better knew;<br/>
Asylas best the pointed jav'lin threw.<br/>
Brave Caeneus laid Ortygius on the plain;<br/>
The victor Caeneus was by Turnus slain.<br/>
By the same hand, Clonius and Itys fall,<br/>
Sagar, and Ida, standing on the wall.<br/>
From Capys' arms his fate Privernus found:<br/>
Hurt by Themilla first—but slight the wound—<br/>
His shield thrown by, to mitigate the smart,<br/>
He clapp'd his hand upon the wounded part:<br/>
The second shaft came swift and unespied,<br/>
And pierc'd his hand, and nail'd it to his side,<br/>
Transfix'd his breathing lungs and beating heart:<br/>
The soul came issuing out, and hiss'd against the dart.
</p>
<p>
The son of Arcens shone amid the rest,<br/>
In glitt'ring armour and a purple vest,<br/>
(Fair was his face, his eyes inspiring love,)<br/>
Bred by his father in the Martian grove,<br/>
Where the fat altars of Palicus flame,<br/>
And send in arms to purchase early fame.<br/>
Him when he spied from far, the Tuscan king<br/>
Laid by the lance, and took him to the sling,<br/>
Thrice whirl'd the thong around his head, and threw:<br/>
The heated lead half melted as it flew;<br/>
It pierc'd his hollow temples and his brain;<br/>
The youth came tumbling down, and spurn'd the plain.
</p>
<p>
Then young Ascanius, who, before this day,<br/>
Was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey,<br/>
First bent in martial strife the twanging bow,<br/>
And exercis'd against a human foe—<br/>
With this bereft Numanus of his life,<br/>
Who Turnus' younger sister took to wife.<br/>
Proud of his realm, and of his royal bride,<br/>
Vaunting before his troops, and lengthen'd with a stride,<br/>
In these insulting terms the Trojans he defied:
</p>
<p>
"Twice-conquer'd cowards, now your shame is shown—<br/>
Coop'd up a second time within your town!<br/>
Who dare not issue forth in open field,<br/>
But hold your walls before you for a shield.<br/>
Thus treat you war? thus our alliance force?<br/>
What gods, what madness, hither steer'd your course?<br/>
You shall not find the sons of Atreus here,<br/>
Nor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear.<br/>
Strong from the cradle, of a sturdy brood,<br/>
We bear our newborn infants to the flood;<br/>
There bath'd amid the stream, our boys we hold,<br/>
With winter harden'd, and inur'd to cold.<br/>
They wake before the day to range the wood,<br/>
Kill ere they eat, nor taste unconquer'd food.<br/>
No sports, but what belong to war, they know:<br/>
To break the stubborn colt, to bend the bow.<br/>
Our youth, of labour patient, earn their bread;<br/>
Hardly they work, with frugal diet fed.<br/>
From plows and harrows sent to seek renown,<br/>
They fight in fields, and storm the shaken town.<br/>
No part of life from toils of war is free,<br/>
No change in age, or diff'rence in degree.<br/>
We plow and till in arms; our oxen feel,<br/>
Instead of goads, the spur and pointed steel;<br/>
Th' inverted lance makes furrows in the plain.<br/>
Ev'n time, that changes all, yet changes us in vain:<br/>
The body, not the mind; nor can control<br/>
Th' immortal vigour, or abate the soul.<br/>
Our helms defend the young, disguise the gray:<br/>
We live by plunder, and delight in prey.<br/>
Your vests embroider'd with rich purple shine;<br/>
In sloth you glory, and in dances join.<br/>
Your vests have sweeping sleeves; with female pride<br/>
Your turbans underneath your chins are tied.<br/>
Go, Phrygians, to your Dindymus again!<br/>
Go, less than women, in the shapes of men!<br/>
Go, mix'd with eunuchs, in the Mother's rites,<br/>
Where with unequal sound the flute invites;<br/>
Sing, dance, and howl, by turns, in Ida's shade:<br/>
Resign the war to men, who know the martial trade!"
</p>
<p>
This foul reproach Ascanius could not hear<br/>
With patience, or a vow'd revenge forbear.<br/>
At the full stretch of both his hands he drew,<br/>
And almost join'd the horns of the tough yew.<br/>
But, first, before the throne of Jove he stood,<br/>
And thus with lifted hands invok'd the god:<br/>
"My first attempt, great Jupiter, succeed!<br/>
An annual off'ring in thy grove shall bleed;<br/>
A snow-white steer, before thy altar led,<br/>
Who, like his mother, bears aloft his head,<br/>
Butts with his threat'ning brows, and bellowing stands,<br/>
And dares the fight, and spurns the yellow sands."
</p>
<p>
Jove bow'd the heav'ns, and lent a gracious ear,<br/>
And thunder'd on the left, amidst the clear.<br/>
Sounded at once the bow; and swiftly flies<br/>
The feather'd death, and hisses thro' the skies.<br/>
The steel thro' both his temples forc'd the way:<br/>
Extended on the ground, Numanus lay.<br/>
"Go now, vain boaster, and true valour scorn!<br/>
The Phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return."<br/>
Ascanius said no more. The Trojans shake<br/>
The heav'ns with shouting, and new vigour take.
</p>
<p>
Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud,<br/>
To view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd;<br/>
And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud:<br/>
"Advance, illustrious youth, increase in fame,<br/>
And wide from east to west extend thy name;<br/>
Offspring of gods thyself; and Rome shall owe<br/>
To thee a race of demigods below.<br/>
This is the way to heav'n: the pow'rs divine<br/>
From this beginning date the Julian line.<br/>
To thee, to them, and their victorious heirs,<br/>
The conquer'd war is due, and the vast world is theirs.<br/>
Troy is too narrow for thy name." He said,<br/>
And plunging downward shot his radiant head;<br/>
Dispell'd the breathing air, that broke his flight:<br/>
Shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight.<br/>
Old Butes' form he took, Anchises' squire,<br/>
Now left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire:<br/>
His wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs,<br/>
His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears,<br/>
And thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years:<br/>
"Suffice it thee, thy father's worthy son,<br/>
The warlike prize thou hast already won.<br/>
The god of archers gives thy youth a part<br/>
Of his own praise, nor envies equal art.<br/>
Now tempt the war no more." He said, and flew<br/>
Obscure in air, and vanish'd from their view.<br/>
The Trojans, by his arms, their patron know,<br/>
And hear the twanging of his heav'nly bow.<br/>
Then duteous force they use, and Phoebus' name,<br/>
To keep from fight the youth too fond of fame.<br/>
Undaunted, they themselves no danger shun;<br/>
From wall to wall the shouts and clamours run.<br/>
They bend their bows; they whirl their slings around;<br/>
Heaps of spent arrows fall, and strew the ground;<br/>
And helms, and shields, and rattling arms resound.<br/>
The combat thickens, like the storm that flies<br/>
From westward, when the show'ry Kids arise;<br/>
Or patt'ring hail comes pouring on the main,<br/>
When Jupiter descends in harden'd rain,<br/>
Or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound,<br/>
And with an armed winter strew the ground.
</p>
<p>
Pand'rus and Bitias, thunderbolts of war,<br/>
Whom Hiera to bold Alcanor bare<br/>
On Ida's top, two youths of height and size<br/>
Like firs that on their mother mountain rise,<br/>
Presuming on their force, the gates unbar,<br/>
And of their own accord invite the war.<br/>
With fates averse, against their king's command,<br/>
Arm'd, on the right and on the left they stand,<br/>
And flank the passage: shining steel they wear,<br/>
And waving crests above their heads appear.<br/>
Thus two tall oaks, that Padus' banks adorn,<br/>
Lift up to heav'n their leafy heads unshorn,<br/>
And, overpress'd with nature's heavy load,<br/>
Dance to the whistling winds, and at each other nod.<br/>
In flows a tide of Latians, when they see<br/>
The gate set open, and the passage free;<br/>
Bold Quercens, with rash Tmarus, rushing on,<br/>
Equicolus, that in bright armour shone,<br/>
And Haemon first; but soon repuls'd they fly,<br/>
Or in the well-defended pass they die.<br/>
These with success are fir'd, and those with rage,<br/>
And each on equal terms at length engage.<br/>
Drawn from their lines, and issuing on the plain,<br/>
The Trojans hand to hand the fight maintain.
</p>
<p>
Fierce Turnus in another quarter fought,<br/>
When suddenly th' unhop'd-for news was brought,<br/>
The foes had left the fastness of their place,<br/>
Prevail'd in fight, and had his men in chase.<br/>
He quits th' attack, and, to prevent their fate,<br/>
Runs where the giant brothers guard the gate.<br/>
The first he met, Antiphates the brave,<br/>
But base-begotten on a Theban slave,<br/>
Sarpedon's son, he slew: the deadly dart<br/>
Found passage thro' his breast, and pierc'd his heart.<br/>
Fix'd in the wound th' Italian cornel stood,<br/>
Warm'd in his lungs, and in his vital blood.<br/>
Aphidnus next, and Erymanthus dies,<br/>
And Meropes, and the gigantic size<br/>
Of Bitias, threat'ning with his ardent eyes.<br/>
Not by the feeble dart he fell oppress'd<br/>
(A dart were lost within that roomy breast),<br/>
But from a knotted lance, large, heavy, strong,<br/>
Which roar'd like thunder as it whirl'd along:<br/>
Not two bull hides th' impetuous force withhold,<br/>
Nor coat of double mail, with scales of gold.<br/>
Down sunk the monster bulk and press'd the ground;<br/>
His arms and clatt'ring shield on the vast body sound,<br/>
Not with less ruin than the Bajan mole,<br/>
Rais'd on the seas, the surges to control—<br/>
At once comes tumbling down the rocky wall;<br/>
Prone to the deep, the stones disjointed fall<br/>
Of the vast pile; the scatter'd ocean flies;<br/>
Black sands, discolour'd froth, and mingled mud arise:<br/>
The frighted billows roll, and seek the shores;<br/>
Then trembles Prochyta, then Ischia roars:<br/>
Typhoeus, thrown beneath, by Jove's command,<br/>
Astonish'd at the flaw that shakes the land,<br/>
Soon shifts his weary side, and, scarce awake,<br/>
With wonder feels the weight press lighter on his back.
</p>
<p>
The warrior god the Latian troops inspir'd,<br/>
New strung their sinews, and their courage fir'd,<br/>
But chills the Trojan hearts with cold affright:<br/>
Then black despair precipitates their flight.
</p>
<p>
When Pandarus beheld his brother kill'd,<br/>
The town with fear and wild confusion fill'd,<br/>
He turns the hinges of the heavy gate<br/>
With both his hands, and adds his shoulders to the weight<br/>
Some happier friends within the walls inclos'd;<br/>
The rest shut out, to certain death expos'd:<br/>
Fool as he was, and frantic in his care,<br/>
T' admit young Turnus, and include the war!<br/>
He thrust amid the crowd, securely bold,<br/>
Like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold.<br/>
Too late his blazing buckler they descry,<br/>
And sparkling fires that shot from either eye,<br/>
His mighty members, and his ample breast,<br/>
His rattling armour, and his crimson crest.
</p>
<p>
Far from that hated face the Trojans fly,<br/>
All but the fool who sought his destiny.<br/>
Mad Pandarus steps forth, with vengeance vow'd<br/>
For Bitias' death, and threatens thus aloud:<br/>
"These are not Ardea's walls, nor this the town<br/>
Amata proffers with Lavinia's crown:<br/>
'Tis hostile earth you tread. Of hope bereft,<br/>
No means of safe return by flight are left."<br/>
To whom, with count'nance calm, and soul sedate,<br/>
Thus Turnus: "Then begin, and try thy fate:<br/>
My message to the ghost of Priam bear;<br/>
Tell him a new Achilles sent thee there."
</p>
<p>
A lance of tough ground ash the Trojan threw,<br/>
Rough in the rind, and knotted as it grew:<br/>
With his full force he whirl'd it first around;<br/>
But the soft yielding air receiv'd the wound:<br/>
Imperial Juno turn'd the course before,<br/>
And fix'd the wand'ring weapon in the door.
</p>
<p>
"But hope not thou," said Turnus, "when I strike,<br/>
To shun thy fate: our force is not alike,<br/>
Nor thy steel temper'd by the Lemnian god."<br/>
Then rising, on his utmost stretch he stood,<br/>
And aim'd from high: the full descending blow<br/>
Cleaves the broad front and beardless cheeks in two.<br/>
Down sinks the giant with a thund'ring sound:<br/>
His pond'rous limbs oppress the trembling ground;<br/>
Blood, brains, and foam gush from the gaping wound:<br/>
Scalp, face, and shoulders the keen steel divides,<br/>
And the shar'd visage hangs on equal sides.<br/>
The Trojans fly from their approaching fate;<br/>
And, had the victor then secur'd the gate,<br/>
And to his troops without unclos'd the bars,<br/>
One lucky day had ended all his wars.<br/>
But boiling youth, and blind desire of blood,<br/>
Push'd on his fury, to pursue the crowd.<br/>
Hamstring'd behind, unhappy Gyges died;<br/>
Then Phalaris is added to his side.<br/>
The pointed jav'lins from the dead he drew,<br/>
And their friends' arms against their fellows threw.<br/>
Strong Halys stands in vain; weak Phlegys flies;<br/>
Saturnia, still at hand, new force and fire supplies.<br/>
Then Halius, Prytanis, Alcander fall—<br/>
Engag'd against the foes who scal'd the wall:<br/>
But, whom they fear'd without, they found within.<br/>
At last, tho' late, by Lynceus he was seen.<br/>
He calls new succours, and assaults the prince:<br/>
But weak his force, and vain is their defence.<br/>
Turn'd to the right, his sword the hero drew,<br/>
And at one blow the bold aggressor slew.<br/>
He joints the neck; and, with a stroke so strong,<br/>
The helm flies off, and bears the head along.<br/>
Next him, the huntsman Amycus he kill'd,<br/>
In darts envenom'd and in poison skill'd.<br/>
Then Clytius fell beneath his fatal spear,<br/>
And Creteus, whom the Muses held so dear:<br/>
He fought with courage, and he sung the fight;<br/>
Arms were his bus'ness, verses his delight.
</p>
<p>
The Trojan chiefs behold, with rage and grief,<br/>
Their slaughter'd friends, and hasten their relief.<br/>
Bold Mnestheus rallies first the broken train,<br/>
Whom brave Seresthus and his troop sustain.<br/>
To save the living, and revenge the dead,<br/>
Against one warrior's arms all Troy they led.<br/>
"O, void of sense and courage!" Mnestheus cried,<br/>
"Where can you hope your coward heads to hide?<br/>
Ah! where beyond these rampires can you run?<br/>
One man, and in your camp inclos'd, you shun!<br/>
Shall then a single sword such slaughter boast,<br/>
And pass unpunish'd from a num'rous host?<br/>
Forsaking honour, and renouncing fame,<br/>
Your gods, your country, and your king you shame!"<br/>
This just reproach their virtue does excite:<br/>
They stand, they join, they thicken to the fight.
</p>
<p>
Now Turnus doubts, and yet disdains to yield,<br/>
But with slow paces measures back the field,<br/>
And inches to the walls, where Tiber's tide,<br/>
Washing the camp, defends the weaker side.<br/>
The more he loses, they advance the more,<br/>
And tread in ev'ry step he trod before.<br/>
They shout: they bear him back; and, whom by might<br/>
They cannot conquer, they oppress with weight.
</p>
<p>
As, compass'd with a wood of spears around,<br/>
The lordly lion still maintains his ground;<br/>
Grins horrible, retires, and turns again;<br/>
Threats his distended paws, and shakes his mane;<br/>
He loses while in vain he presses on,<br/>
Nor will his courage let him dare to run:<br/>
So Turnus fares, and, unresolved of flight,<br/>
Moves tardy back, and just recedes from fight.<br/>
Yet twice, enrag'd, the combat he renews,<br/>
Twice breaks, and twice his broken foes pursues.<br/>
But now they swarm, and, with fresh troops supplied,<br/>
Come rolling on, and rush from ev'ry side:<br/>
Nor Juno, who sustain'd his arms before,<br/>
Dares with new strength suffice th' exhausted store;<br/>
For Jove, with sour commands, sent Iris down,<br/>
To force th' invader from the frighted town.
</p>
<p>
With labour spent, no longer can he wield<br/>
The heavy falchion, or sustain the shield,<br/>
O'erwhelm'd with darts, which from afar they fling:<br/>
The weapons round his hollow temples ring;<br/>
His golden helm gives way, with stony blows<br/>
Batter'd, and flat, and beaten to his brows.<br/>
His crest is rash'd away; his ample shield<br/>
Is falsified, and round with jav'lins fill'd.
</p>
<p>
The foe, now faint, the Trojans overwhelm;<br/>
And Mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm.<br/>
Sick sweat succeeds; he drops at ev'ry pore;<br/>
With driving dust his cheeks are pasted o'er;<br/>
Shorter and shorter ev'ry gasp he takes;<br/>
And vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes.<br/>
Plung'd in the flood, and made the waters fly.<br/>
The yellow god the welcome burthen bore,<br/>
And wip'd the sweat, and wash'd away the gore;<br/>
Then gently wafts him to the farther coast,<br/>
And sends him safe to cheer his anxious host.

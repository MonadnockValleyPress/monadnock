<h1>Aeneid</h1>
<h2>by Virgil</h2>
<h3>Book VI</h3>
<p>
He said, and wept; then spread his sails before<br/>
The winds, and reach'd at length the Cumaean shore:<br/>
Their anchors dropp'd, his crew the vessels moor.<br/>
They turn their heads to sea, their sterns to land,<br/>
And greet with greedy joy th' Italian strand.<br/>
Some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed;<br/>
Some gather sticks, the kindled flames to feed,<br/>
Or search for hollow trees, and fell the woods,<br/>
Or trace thro' valleys the discover'd floods.<br/>
Thus, while their sev'ral charges they fulfil,<br/>
The pious prince ascends the sacred hill<br/>
Where Phoebus is ador'd; and seeks the shade<br/>
Which hides from sight his venerable maid.<br/>
Deep in a cave the Sibyl makes abode;<br/>
Thence full of fate returns, and of the god.<br/>
Thro' Trivia's grove they walk; and now behold,<br/>
And enter now, the temple roof'd with gold.<br/>
When Daedalus, to fly the Cretan shore,<br/>
His heavy limbs on jointed pinions bore,<br/>
(The first who sail'd in air,) 'tis sung by Fame,<br/>
To the Cumaean coast at length he came,<br/>
And here alighting, built this costly frame.<br/>
Inscrib'd to Phoebus, here he hung on high<br/>
The steerage of his wings, that cut the sky:<br/>
Then o'er the lofty gate his art emboss'd<br/>
Androgeos' death, and off'rings to his ghost;<br/>
Sev'n youths from Athens yearly sent, to meet<br/>
The fate appointed by revengeful Crete.<br/>
And next to those the dreadful urn was plac'd,<br/>
In which the destin'd names by lots were cast:<br/>
The mournful parents stand around in tears,<br/>
And rising Crete against their shore appears.<br/>
There too, in living sculpture, might be seen<br/>
The mad affection of the Cretan queen;<br/>
Then how she cheats her bellowing lover's eye;<br/>
The rushing leap, the doubtful progeny,<br/>
The lower part a beast, a man above,<br/>
The monument of their polluted love.<br/>
Not far from thence he grav'd the wondrous maze,<br/>
A thousand doors, a thousand winding ways:<br/>
Here dwells the monster, hid from human view,<br/>
Not to be found, but by the faithful clue;<br/>
Till the kind artist, mov'd with pious grief,<br/>
Lent to the loving maid this last relief,<br/>
And all those erring paths describ'd so well<br/>
That Theseus conquer'd and the monster fell.<br/>
Here hapless Icarus had found his part,<br/>
Had not the father's grief restrain'd his art.<br/>
He twice assay'd to cast his son in gold;<br/>
Twice from his hands he dropp'd the forming mould.
</p>
<p>
All this with wond'ring eyes Aeneas view'd;<br/>
Each varying object his delight renew'd:<br/>
Eager to read the rest, Achates came,<br/>
And by his side the mad divining dame,<br/>
The priestess of the god, Deiphobe her name.<br/>
"Time suffers not," she said, "to feed your eyes<br/>
With empty pleasures; haste the sacrifice.<br/>
Sev'n bullocks, yet unyok'd, for Phoebus choose,<br/>
And for Diana sev'n unspotted ewes."<br/>
This said, the servants urge the sacred rites,<br/>
While to the temple she the prince invites.<br/>
A spacious cave, within its farmost part,<br/>
Was hew'd and fashion'd by laborious art<br/>
Thro' the hill's hollow sides: before the place,<br/>
A hundred doors a hundred entries grace;<br/>
As many voices issue, and the sound<br/>
Of Sybil's words as many times rebound.<br/>
Now to the mouth they come. Aloud she cries:<br/>
"This is the time; enquire your destinies.<br/>
He comes; behold the god!" Thus while she said,<br/>
(And shiv'ring at the sacred entry stay'd,)<br/>
Her colour chang'd; her face was not the same,<br/>
And hollow groans from her deep spirit came.<br/>
Her hair stood up; convulsive rage possess'd<br/>
Her trembling limbs, and heav'd her lab'ring breast.<br/>
Greater than humankind she seem'd to look,<br/>
And with an accent more than mortal spoke.<br/>
Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll;<br/>
When all the god came rushing on her soul.<br/>
Swiftly she turn'd, and, foaming as she spoke:<br/>
"Why this delay?" she cried; "the pow'rs invoke!<br/>
Thy pray'rs alone can open this abode;<br/>
Else vain are my demands, and dumb the god."
</p>
<p>
She said no more. The trembling Trojans hear,<br/>
O'erspread with a damp sweat and holy fear.<br/>
The prince himself, with awful dread possess'd,<br/>
His vows to great Apollo thus address'd:<br/>
"Indulgent god, propitious pow'r to Troy,<br/>
Swift to relieve, unwilling to destroy,<br/>
Directed by whose hand the Dardan dart<br/>
Pierc'd the proud Grecian's only mortal part:<br/>
Thus far, by fate's decrees and thy commands,<br/>
Thro' ambient seas and thro' devouring sands,<br/>
Our exil'd crew has sought th' Ausonian ground;<br/>
And now, at length, the flying coast is found.<br/>
Thus far the fate of Troy, from place to place,<br/>
With fury has pursued her wand'ring race.<br/>
Here cease, ye pow'rs, and let your vengeance end:<br/>
Troy is no more, and can no more offend.<br/>
And thou, O sacred maid, inspir'd to see<br/>
Th' event of things in dark futurity;<br/>
Give me what Heav'n has promis'd to my fate,<br/>
To conquer and command the Latian state;<br/>
To fix my wand'ring gods, and find a place<br/>
For the long exiles of the Trojan race.<br/>
Then shall my grateful hands a temple rear<br/>
To the twin gods, with vows and solemn pray'r;<br/>
And annual rites, and festivals, and games,<br/>
Shall be perform'd to their auspicious names.<br/>
Nor shalt thou want thy honours in my land;<br/>
For there thy faithful oracles shall stand,<br/>
Preserv'd in shrines; and ev'ry sacred lay,<br/>
Which, by thy mouth, Apollo shall convey:<br/>
All shall be treasur'd by a chosen train<br/>
Of holy priests, and ever shall remain.<br/>
But O! commit not thy prophetic mind<br/>
To flitting leaves, the sport of ev'ry wind,<br/>
Lest they disperse in air our empty fate;<br/>
Write not, but, what the pow'rs ordain, relate."
</p>
<p>
Struggling in vain, impatient of her load,<br/>
And lab'ring underneath the pond'rous god,<br/>
The more she strove to shake him from her breast,<br/>
With more and far superior force he press'd;<br/>
Commands his entrance, and, without control,<br/>
Usurps her organs and inspires her soul.<br/>
Now, with a furious blast, the hundred doors<br/>
Ope of themselves; a rushing whirlwind roars<br/>
Within the cave, and Sibyl's voice restores:<br/>
"Escap'd the dangers of the wat'ry reign,<br/>
Yet more and greater ills by land remain.<br/>
The coast, so long desir'd (nor doubt th' event),<br/>
Thy troops shall reach, but, having reach'd, repent.<br/>
Wars, horrid wars, I view; a field of blood,<br/>
And Tiber rolling with a purple flood.<br/>
Simois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there:<br/>
A new Achilles shall in arms appear,<br/>
And he, too, goddess-born. Fierce Juno's hate,<br/>
Added to hostile force, shall urge thy fate.<br/>
To what strange nations shalt not thou resort,<br/>
Driv'n to solicit aid at ev'ry court!<br/>
The cause the same which Ilium once oppress'd;<br/>
A foreign mistress, and a foreign guest.<br/>
But thou, secure of soul, unbent with woes,<br/>
The more thy fortune frowns, the more oppose.<br/>
The dawnings of thy safety shall be shown<br/>
From whence thou least shalt hope, a Grecian town."
</p>
<p>
Thus, from the dark recess, the Sibyl spoke,<br/>
And the resisting air the thunder broke;<br/>
The cave rebellow'd, and the temple shook.<br/>
Th' ambiguous god, who rul'd her lab'ring breast,<br/>
In these mysterious words his mind express'd;<br/>
Some truths reveal'd, in terms involv'd the rest.<br/>
At length her fury fell, her foaming ceas'd,<br/>
And, ebbing in her soul, the god decreas'd.<br/>
Then thus the chief: "No terror to my view,<br/>
No frightful face of danger can be new.<br/>
Inur'd to suffer, and resolv'd to dare,<br/>
The Fates, without my pow'r, shall be without my care.<br/>
This let me crave, since near your grove the road<br/>
To hell lies open, and the dark abode<br/>
Which Acheron surrounds, th' innavigable flood;<br/>
Conduct me thro' the regions void of light,<br/>
And lead me longing to my father's sight.<br/>
For him, a thousand dangers I have sought,<br/>
And, rushing where the thickest Grecians fought,<br/>
Safe on my back the sacred burthen brought.<br/>
He, for my sake, the raging ocean tried,<br/>
And wrath of Heav'n, my still auspicious guide,<br/>
And bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied.<br/>
Oft, since he breath'd his last, in dead of night<br/>
His reverend image stood before my sight;<br/>
Enjoin'd to seek, below, his holy shade;<br/>
Conducted there by your unerring aid.<br/>
But you, if pious minds by pray'rs are won,<br/>
Oblige the father, and protect the son.<br/>
Yours is the pow'r; nor Proserpine in vain<br/>
Has made you priestess of her nightly reign.<br/>
If Orpheus, arm'd with his enchanting lyre,<br/>
The ruthless king with pity could inspire,<br/>
And from the shades below redeem his wife;<br/>
If Pollux, off'ring his alternate life,<br/>
Could free his brother, and can daily go<br/>
By turns aloft, by turns descend below:<br/>
Why name I Theseus, or his greater friend,<br/>
Who trod the downward path, and upward could ascend?<br/>
Not less than theirs from Jove my lineage came;<br/>
My mother greater, my descent the same."<br/>
So pray'd the Trojan prince, and, while he pray'd,<br/>
His hand upon the holy altar laid.
</p>
<p>
Then thus replied the prophetess divine:<br/>
"O goddess-born of great Anchises' line,<br/>
The gates of hell are open night and day;<br/>
Smooth the descent, and easy is the way:<br/>
But to return, and view the cheerful skies,<br/>
In this the task and mighty labour lies.<br/>
To few great Jupiter imparts this grace,<br/>
And those of shining worth and heav'nly race.<br/>
Betwixt those regions and our upper light,<br/>
Deep forests and impenetrable night<br/>
Possess the middle space: th' infernal bounds<br/>
Cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds.<br/>
But if so dire a love your soul invades,<br/>
As twice below to view the trembling shades;<br/>
If you so hard a toil will undertake,<br/>
As twice to pass th' innavigable lake;<br/>
Receive my counsel. In the neighb'ring grove<br/>
There stands a tree; the queen of Stygian Jove<br/>
Claims it her own; thick woods and gloomy night<br/>
Conceal the happy plant from human sight.<br/>
One bough it bears; but wondrous to behold!<br/>
The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold:<br/>
This from the vulgar branches must be torn,<br/>
And to fair Proserpine the present borne,<br/>
Ere leave be giv'n to tempt the nether skies.<br/>
The first thus rent a second will arise,<br/>
And the same metal the same room supplies.<br/>
Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see<br/>
The lurking gold upon the fatal tree:<br/>
Then rend it off, as holy rites command;<br/>
The willing metal will obey thy hand,<br/>
Following with ease, if favour'd by thy fate,<br/>
Thou art foredoom'd to view the Stygian state:<br/>
If not, no labour can the tree constrain;<br/>
And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain.<br/>
Besides, you know not, while you here attend,<br/>
Th' unworthy fate of your unhappy friend:<br/>
Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost,<br/>
Depriv'd of fun'ral rites, pollutes your host.<br/>
Pay first his pious dues; and, for the dead,<br/>
Two sable sheep around his hearse be led;<br/>
Then, living turfs upon his body lay:<br/>
This done, securely take the destin'd way,<br/>
To find the regions destitute of day."
</p>
<p>
She said, and held her peace. Aeneas went<br/>
Sad from the cave, and full of discontent,<br/>
Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant.<br/>
Achates, the companion of his breast,<br/>
Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppress'd.<br/>
Walking, they talk'd, and fruitlessly divin'd<br/>
What friend the priestess by those words design'd.<br/>
But soon they found an object to deplore:<br/>
Misenus lay extended on the shore;<br/>
Son of the God of Winds: none so renown'd<br/>
The warrior trumpet in the field to sound;<br/>
With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms,<br/>
And rouse to dare their fate in honourable arms.<br/>
He serv'd great Hector, and was ever near,<br/>
Not with his trumpet only, but his spear.<br/>
But by Pelides' arms when Hector fell,<br/>
He chose Aeneas; and he chose as well.<br/>
Swoln with applause, and aiming still at more,<br/>
He now provokes the sea gods from the shore;<br/>
With envy Triton heard the martial sound,<br/>
And the bold champion, for his challenge, drown'd;<br/>
Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand:<br/>
The gazing crowd around the body stand.<br/>
All weep; but most Aeneas mourns his fate,<br/>
And hastens to perform the funeral state.<br/>
In altar-wise, a stately pile they rear;<br/>
The basis broad below, and top advanc'd in air.<br/>
An ancient wood, fit for the work design'd,<br/>
(The shady covert of the salvage kind,)<br/>
The Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied;<br/>
Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow'ring pride<br/>
Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke,<br/>
And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.<br/>
Huge trunks of trees, fell'd from the steepy crown<br/>
Of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down.<br/>
Arm'd like the rest the Trojan prince appears,<br/>
And by his pious labour urges theirs.
</p>
<p>
Thus while he wrought, revolving in his mind<br/>
The ways to compass what his wish design'd,<br/>
He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove,<br/>
And then with vows implor'd the Queen of Love:<br/>
"O may thy pow'r, propitious still to me,<br/>
Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree,<br/>
In this deep forest; since the Sibyl's breath<br/>
Foretold, alas! too true, Misenus' death."<br/>
Scarce had he said, when, full before his sight,<br/>
Two doves, descending from their airy flight,<br/>
Secure upon the grassy plain alight.<br/>
He knew his mother's birds; and thus he pray'd:<br/>
"Be you my guides, with your auspicious aid,<br/>
And lead my footsteps, till the branch be found,<br/>
Whose glitt'ring shadow gilds the sacred ground.<br/>
And thou, great parent, with celestial care,<br/>
In this distress be present to my pray'r!"<br/>
Thus having said, he stopp'd with watchful sight,<br/>
Observing still the motions of their flight,<br/>
What course they took, what happy signs they shew.<br/>
They fed, and, flutt'ring, by degrees withdrew<br/>
Still farther from the place, but still in view:<br/>
Hopping and flying, thus they led him on<br/>
To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun<br/>
They wing'd their flight aloft; then, stooping low,<br/>
Perch'd on the double tree that bears the golden bough.<br/>
Thro' the green leafs the glitt'ring shadows glow;<br/>
As, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe,<br/>
Where the proud mother views her precious brood,<br/>
And happier branches, which she never sow'd.<br/>
Such was the glitt'ring; such the ruddy rind,<br/>
And dancing leaves, that wanton'd in the wind.<br/>
He seiz'd the shining bough with griping hold,<br/>
And rent away, with ease, the ling'ring gold;<br/>
Then to the Sibyl's palace bore the prize.<br/>
Meantime the Trojan troops, with weeping eyes,<br/>
To dead Misenus pay his obsequies.<br/>
First, from the ground a lofty pile they rear,<br/>
Of pitch trees, oaks, and pines, and unctuous fir:<br/>
The fabric's front with cypress twigs they strew,<br/>
And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew.<br/>
The topmost part his glitt'ring arms adorn;<br/>
Warm waters, then, in brazen caldrons borne,<br/>
Are pour'd to wash his body, joint by joint,<br/>
And fragrant oils the stiffen'd limbs anoint.<br/>
With groans and cries Misenus they deplore:<br/>
Then on a bier, with purple cover'd o'er,<br/>
The breathless body, thus bewail'd, they lay,<br/>
And fire the pile, their faces turn'd away:<br/>
Such reverend rites their fathers us'd to pay.<br/>
Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw,<br/>
And fat of victims, which his friends bestow.<br/>
These gifts the greedy flames to dust devour;<br/>
Then on the living coals red wine they pour;<br/>
And, last, the relics by themselves dispose,<br/>
Which in a brazen urn the priests inclose.<br/>
Old Corynaeus compass'd thrice the crew,<br/>
And dipp'd an olive branch in holy dew;<br/>
Which thrice he sprinkled round, and thrice aloud<br/>
Invok'd the dead, and then dismissed the crowd.<br/>
But good Aeneas order'd on the shore<br/>
A stately tomb, whose top a trumpet bore,<br/>
A soldier's falchion, and a seaman's oar.<br/>
Thus was his friend interr'd; and deathless fame<br/>
Still to the lofty cape consigns his name.<br/>
These rites perform'd, the prince, without delay,<br/>
Hastes to the nether world his destin'd way.<br/>
Deep was the cave; and, downward as it went<br/>
From the wide mouth, a rocky rough descent;<br/>
And here th' access a gloomy grove defends,<br/>
And there th' unnavigable lake extends,<br/>
O'er whose unhappy waters, void of light,<br/>
No bird presumes to steer his airy flight;<br/>
Such deadly stenches from the depths arise,<br/>
And steaming sulphur, that infects the skies.<br/>
From hence the Grecian bards their legends make,<br/>
And give the name Avernus to the lake.<br/>
Four sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught,<br/>
For sacrifice the pious hero brought.<br/>
The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns;<br/>
Then cuts the curling hair; that first oblation burns,<br/>
Invoking Hecate hither to repair:<br/>
A pow'rful name in hell and upper air.<br/>
The sacred priests with ready knives bereave<br/>
The beasts of life, and in full bowls receive<br/>
The streaming blood: a lamb to Hell and Night<br/>
(The sable wool without a streak of white)<br/>
Aeneas offers; and, by fate's decree,<br/>
A barren heifer, Proserpine, to thee,<br/>
With holocausts he Pluto's altar fills;<br/>
Sev'n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills;<br/>
Then on the broiling entrails oil he pours;<br/>
Which, ointed thus, the raging flame devours.<br/>
Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun,<br/>
Nor ended till the next returning sun.<br/>
Then earth began to bellow, trees to dance,<br/>
And howling dogs in glimm'ring light advance,<br/>
Ere Hecate came. "Far hence be souls profane!"<br/>
The Sibyl cried, "and from the grove abstain!<br/>
Now, Trojan, take the way thy fates afford;<br/>
Assume thy courage, and unsheathe thy sword."<br/>
She said, and pass'd along the gloomy space;<br/>
The prince pursued her steps with equal pace.
</p>
<p>
Ye realms, yet unreveal'd to human sight,<br/>
Ye gods who rule the regions of the night,<br/>
Ye gliding ghosts, permit me to relate<br/>
The mystic wonders of your silent state!
</p>
<p>
Obscure they went thro' dreary shades, that led<br/>
Along the waste dominions of the dead.<br/>
Thus wander travelers in woods by night,<br/>
By the moon's doubtful and malignant light,<br/>
When Jove in dusky clouds involves the skies,<br/>
And the faint crescent shoots by fits before their eyes.
</p>
<p>
Just in the gate and in the jaws of hell,<br/>
Revengeful Cares and sullen Sorrows dwell,<br/>
And pale Diseases, and repining Age,<br/>
Want, Fear, and Famine's unresisted rage;<br/>
Here Toils, and Death, and Death's half-brother, Sleep,<br/>
Forms terrible to view, their sentry keep;<br/>
With anxious Pleasures of a guilty mind,<br/>
Deep Frauds before, and open Force behind;<br/>
The Furies' iron beds; and Strife, that shakes<br/>
Her hissing tresses and unfolds her snakes.<br/>
Full in the midst of this infernal road,<br/>
An elm displays her dusky arms abroad:<br/>
The God of Sleep there hides his heavy head,<br/>
And empty dreams on ev'ry leaf are spread.<br/>
Of various forms unnumber'd spectres more,<br/>
Centaurs, and double shapes, besiege the door.<br/>
Before the passage, horrid Hydra stands,<br/>
And Briareus with all his hundred hands;<br/>
Gorgons, Geryon with his triple frame;<br/>
And vain Chimaera vomits empty flame.<br/>
The chief unsheath'd his shining steel, prepar'd,<br/>
Tho' seiz'd with sudden fear, to force the guard,<br/>
Off'ring his brandish'd weapon at their face;<br/>
Had not the Sibyl stopp'd his eager pace,<br/>
And told him what those empty phantoms were:<br/>
Forms without bodies, and impassive air.<br/>
Hence to deep Acheron they take their way,<br/>
Whose troubled eddies, thick with ooze and clay,<br/>
Are whirl'd aloft, and in Cocytus lost.<br/>
There Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast:<br/>
A sordid god: down from his hoary chin<br/>
A length of beard descends, uncomb'd, unclean;<br/>
His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire;<br/>
A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire.<br/>
He spreads his canvas; with his pole he steers;<br/>
The freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom bears.<br/>
He look'd in years; yet in his years were seen<br/>
A youthful vigour and autumnal green.<br/>
An airy crowd came rushing where he stood,<br/>
Which fill'd the margin of the fatal flood:<br/>
Husbands and wives, boys and unmarried maids,<br/>
And mighty heroes' more majestic shades,<br/>
And youths, intomb'd before their fathers' eyes,<br/>
With hollow groans, and shrieks, and feeble cries.<br/>
Thick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods,<br/>
Or fowls, by winter forc'd, forsake the floods,<br/>
And wing their hasty flight to happier lands;<br/>
Such, and so thick, the shiv'ring army stands,<br/>
And press for passage with extended hands.<br/>
Now these, now those, the surly boatman bore:<br/>
The rest he drove to distance from the shore.<br/>
The hero, who beheld with wond'ring eyes<br/>
The tumult mix'd with shrieks, laments, and cries,<br/>
Ask'd of his guide, what the rude concourse meant;<br/>
Why to the shore the thronging people bent;<br/>
What forms of law among the ghosts were us'd;<br/>
Why some were ferried o'er, and some refus'd.
</p>
<p>
"Son of Anchises, offspring of the gods,"<br/>
The Sibyl said, "you see the Stygian floods,<br/>
The sacred stream which heav'n's imperial state<br/>
Attests in oaths, and fears to violate.<br/>
The ghosts rejected are th' unhappy crew<br/>
Depriv'd of sepulchers and fun'ral due:<br/>
The boatman, Charon; those, the buried host,<br/>
He ferries over to the farther coast;<br/>
Nor dares his transport vessel cross the waves<br/>
With such whose bones are not compos'd in graves.<br/>
A hundred years they wander on the shore;<br/>
At length, their penance done, are wafted o'er."<br/>
The Trojan chief his forward pace repress'd,<br/>
Revolving anxious thoughts within his breast,<br/>
He saw his friends, who, whelm'd beneath the waves,<br/>
Their fun'ral honours claim'd, and ask'd their quiet graves.<br/>
The lost Leucaspis in the crowd he knew,<br/>
And the brave leader of the Lycian crew,<br/>
Whom, on the Tyrrhene seas, the tempests met;<br/>
The sailors master'd, and the ship o'erset.
</p>
<p>
Amidst the spirits, Palinurus press'd,<br/>
Yet fresh from life, a new-admitted guest,<br/>
Who, while he steering view'd the stars, and bore<br/>
His course from Afric to the Latian shore,<br/>
Fell headlong down. The Trojan fix'd his view,<br/>
And scarcely thro' the gloom the sullen shadow knew.<br/>
Then thus the prince: "What envious pow'r, O friend,<br/>
Brought your lov'd life to this disastrous end?<br/>
For Phoebus, ever true in all he said,<br/>
Has in your fate alone my faith betray'd.<br/>
The god foretold you should not die, before<br/>
You reach'd, secure from seas, th' Italian shore.<br/>
Is this th' unerring pow'r?" The ghost replied;<br/>
"Nor Phoebus flatter'd, nor his answers lied;<br/>
Nor envious gods have sent me to the deep:<br/>
But, while the stars and course of heav'n I keep,<br/>
My wearied eyes were seiz'd with fatal sleep.<br/>
I fell; and, with my weight, the helm constrain'd<br/>
Was drawn along, which yet my gripe retain'd.<br/>
Now by the winds and raging waves I swear,<br/>
Your safety, more than mine, was then my care;<br/>
Lest, of the guide bereft, the rudder lost,<br/>
Your ship should run against the rocky coast.<br/>
Three blust'ring nights, borne by the southern blast,<br/>
I floated, and discover'd land at last:<br/>
High on a mounting wave my head I bore,<br/>
Forcing my strength, and gath'ring to the shore.<br/>
Panting, but past the danger, now I seiz'd<br/>
The craggy cliffs, and my tir'd members eas'd.<br/>
While, cumber'd with my dropping clothes, I lay,<br/>
The cruel nation, covetous of prey,<br/>
Stain'd with my blood th' unhospitable coast;<br/>
And now, by winds and waves, my lifeless limbs are toss'd:<br/>
Which O avert, by yon ethereal light,<br/>
Which I have lost for this eternal night!<br/>
Or, if by dearer ties you may be won,<br/>
By your dead sire, and by your living son,<br/>
Redeem from this reproach my wand'ring ghost;<br/>
Or with your navy seek the Velin coast,<br/>
And in a peaceful grave my corpse compose;<br/>
Or, if a nearer way your mother shows,<br/>
Without whose aid you durst not undertake<br/>
This frightful passage o'er the Stygian lake,<br/>
Lend to this wretch your hand, and waft him o'er<br/>
To the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore."<br/>
Scarce had he said, the prophetess began:<br/>
"What hopes delude thee, miserable man?<br/>
Think'st thou, thus unintomb'd, to cross the floods,<br/>
To view the Furies and infernal gods,<br/>
And visit, without leave, the dark abodes?<br/>
Attend the term of long revolving years;<br/>
Fate, and the dooming gods, are deaf to tears.<br/>
This comfort of thy dire misfortune take:<br/>
The wrath of Heav'n, inflicted for thy sake,<br/>
With vengeance shall pursue th' inhuman coast,<br/>
Till they propitiate thy offended ghost,<br/>
And raise a tomb, with vows and solemn pray'r;<br/>
And Palinurus' name the place shall bear."<br/>
This calm'd his cares; sooth'd with his future fame,<br/>
And pleas'd to hear his propagated name.
</p>
<p>
Now nearer to the Stygian lake they draw:<br/>
Whom, from the shore, the surly boatman saw;<br/>
Observ'd their passage thro' the shady wood,<br/>
And mark'd their near approaches to the flood.<br/>
Then thus he call'd aloud, inflam'd with wrath:<br/>
"Mortal, whate'er, who this forbidden path<br/>
In arms presum'st to tread, I charge thee, stand,<br/>
And tell thy name, and bus'ness in the land.<br/>
Know this, the realm of night; the Stygian shore:<br/>
My boat conveys no living bodies o'er;<br/>
Nor was I pleas'd great Theseus once to bear,<br/>
Who forc'd a passage with his pointed spear,<br/>
Nor strong Alcides, men of mighty fame,<br/>
And from th' immortal gods their lineage came.<br/>
In fetters one the barking porter tied,<br/>
And took him trembling from his sov'reign's side:<br/>
Two sought by force to seize his beauteous bride."<br/>
To whom the Sibyl thus: "Compose thy mind;<br/>
Nor frauds are here contriv'd, nor force design'd.<br/>
Still may the dog the wand'ring troops constrain<br/>
Of airy ghosts, and vex the guilty train,<br/>
And with her grisly lord his lovely queen remain.<br/>
The Trojan chief, whose lineage is from Jove,<br/>
Much fam'd for arms, and more for filial love,<br/>
Is sent to seek his sire in your Elysian grove.<br/>
If neither piety, nor Heav'n's command,<br/>
Can gain his passage to the Stygian strand,<br/>
This fatal present shall prevail at least."<br/>
Then shew'd the shining bough, conceal'd within her vest.<br/>
No more was needful: for the gloomy god<br/>
Stood mute with awe, to see the golden rod;<br/>
Admir'd the destin'd off'ring to his queen;<br/>
A venerable gift, so rarely seen.<br/>
His fury thus appeas'd, he puts to land;<br/>
The ghosts forsake their seats at his command:<br/>
He clears the deck, receives the mighty freight;<br/>
The leaky vessel groans beneath the weight.<br/>
Slowly she sails, and scarcely stems the tides;<br/>
The pressing water pours within her sides.<br/>
His passengers at length are wafted o'er,<br/>
Expos'd, in muddy weeds, upon the miry shore.
</p>
<p>
No sooner landed, in his den they found<br/>
The triple porter of the Stygian sound,<br/>
Grim Cerberus, who soon began to rear<br/>
His crested snakes, and arm'd his bristling hair.<br/>
The prudent Sibyl had before prepar'd<br/>
A sop, in honey steep'd, to charm the guard;<br/>
Which, mix'd with pow'rful drugs, she cast before<br/>
His greedy grinning jaws, just op'd to roar.<br/>
With three enormous mouths he gapes; and straight,<br/>
With hunger press'd, devours the pleasing bait.<br/>
Long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave;<br/>
He reels, and, falling, fills the spacious cave.<br/>
The keeper charm'd, the chief without delay<br/>
Pass'd on, and took th' irremeable way.<br/>
Before the gates, the cries of babes new born,<br/>
Whom fate had from their tender mothers torn,<br/>
Assault his ears: then those, whom form of laws<br/>
Condemn'd to die, when traitors judg'd their cause.<br/>
Nor want they lots, nor judges to review<br/>
The wrongful sentence, and award a new.<br/>
Minos, the strict inquisitor, appears;<br/>
And lives and crimes, with his assessors, hears.<br/>
Round in his urn the blended balls he rolls,<br/>
Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls.<br/>
The next, in place and punishment, are they<br/>
Who prodigally throw their souls away;<br/>
Fools, who, repining at their wretched state,<br/>
And loathing anxious life, suborn'd their fate.<br/>
With late repentance now they would retrieve<br/>
The bodies they forsook, and wish to live;<br/>
Their pains and poverty desire to bear,<br/>
To view the light of heav'n, and breathe the vital air:<br/>
But fate forbids; the Stygian floods oppose,<br/>
And with circling streams the captive souls inclose.
</p>
<p>
Not far from thence, the Mournful Fields appear<br/>
So call'd from lovers that inhabit there.<br/>
The souls whom that unhappy flame invades,<br/>
In secret solitude and myrtle shades<br/>
Make endless moans, and, pining with desire,<br/>
Lament too late their unextinguish'd fire.<br/>
Here Procris, Eriphyle here he found,<br/>
Baring her breast, yet bleeding with the wound<br/>
Made by her son. He saw Pasiphae there,<br/>
With Phaedra's ghost, a foul incestuous pair.<br/>
There Laodamia, with Evadne, moves,<br/>
Unhappy both, but loyal in their loves:<br/>
Caeneus, a woman once, and once a man,<br/>
But ending in the sex she first began.<br/>
Not far from these Phoenician Dido stood,<br/>
Fresh from her wound, her bosom bath'd in blood;<br/>
Whom when the Trojan hero hardly knew,<br/>
Obscure in shades, and with a doubtful view,<br/>
(Doubtful as he who sees, thro' dusky night,<br/>
Or thinks he sees, the moon's uncertain light,)<br/>
With tears he first approach'd the sullen shade;<br/>
And, as his love inspir'd him, thus he said:<br/>
"Unhappy queen! then is the common breath<br/>
Of rumour true, in your reported death,<br/>
And I, alas! the cause? By Heav'n, I vow,<br/>
And all the pow'rs that rule the realms below,<br/>
Unwilling I forsook your friendly state,<br/>
Commanded by the gods, and forc'd by fate.<br/>
Those gods, that fate, whose unresisted might<br/>
Have sent me to these regions void of light,<br/>
Thro' the vast empire of eternal night.<br/>
Nor dar'd I to presume, that, press'd with grief,<br/>
My flight should urge you to this dire relief.<br/>
Stay, stay your steps, and listen to my vows:<br/>
'Tis the last interview that fate allows!"<br/>
In vain he thus attempts her mind to move<br/>
With tears, and pray'rs, and late-repenting love.<br/>
Disdainfully she look'd; then turning round,<br/>
But fix'd her eyes unmov'd upon the ground,<br/>
And what he says and swears, regards no more<br/>
Than the deaf rocks, when the loud billows roar;<br/>
But whirl'd away, to shun his hateful sight,<br/>
Hid in the forest and the shades of night;<br/>
Then sought Sichaeus thro' the shady grove,<br/>
Who answer'd all her cares, and equal'd all her love.
</p>
<p>
Some pious tears the pitying hero paid,<br/>
And follow'd with his eyes the flitting shade,<br/>
Then took the forward way, by fate ordain'd,<br/>
And, with his guide, the farther fields attain'd,<br/>
Where, sever'd from the rest, the warrior souls remain'd.<br/>
Tydeus he met, with Meleager's race,<br/>
The pride of armies, and the soldiers' grace;<br/>
And pale Adrastus with his ghastly face.<br/>
Of Trojan chiefs he view'd a num'rous train,<br/>
All much lamented, all in battle slain;<br/>
Glaucus and Medon, high above the rest,<br/>
Antenor's sons, and Ceres' sacred priest.<br/>
And proud Idaeus, Priam's charioteer,<br/>
Who shakes his empty reins, and aims his airy spear.<br/>
The gladsome ghosts, in circling troops, attend<br/>
And with unwearied eyes behold their friend;<br/>
Delight to hover near, and long to know<br/>
What bus'ness brought him to the realms below.<br/>
But Argive chiefs, and Agamemnon's train,<br/>
When his refulgent arms flash'd thro' the shady plain,<br/>
Fled from his well-known face, with wonted fear,<br/>
As when his thund'ring sword and pointed spear<br/>
Drove headlong to their ships, and glean'd the routed rear.<br/>
They rais'd a feeble cry, with trembling notes;<br/>
But the weak voice deceiv'd their gasping throats.
</p>
<p>
Here Priam's son, Deiphobus, he found,<br/>
Whose face and limbs were one continued wound:<br/>
Dishonest, with lopp'd arms, the youth appears,<br/>
Spoil'd of his nose, and shorten'd of his ears.<br/>
He scarcely knew him, striving to disown<br/>
His blotted form, and blushing to be known;<br/>
And therefore first began: "O Teucer's race,<br/>
Who durst thy faultless figure thus deface?<br/>
What heart could wish, what hand inflict, this dire disgrace?<br/>
'Twas fam'd, that in our last and fatal night<br/>
Your single prowess long sustain'd the fight,<br/>
Till tir'd, not forc'd, a glorious fate you chose,<br/>
And fell upon a heap of slaughter'd foes.<br/>
But, in remembrance of so brave a deed,<br/>
A tomb and fun'ral honours I decreed;<br/>
Thrice call'd your manes on the Trojan plains:<br/>
The place your armour and your name retains.<br/>
Your body too I sought, and, had I found,<br/>
Design'd for burial in your native ground."
</p>
<p>
The ghost replied: "Your piety has paid<br/>
All needful rites, to rest my wand'ring shade;<br/>
But cruel fate, and my more cruel wife,<br/>
To Grecian swords betray'd my sleeping life.<br/>
These are the monuments of Helen's love:<br/>
The shame I bear below, the marks I bore above.<br/>
You know in what deluding joys we pass'd<br/>
The night that was by Heav'n decreed our last:<br/>
For, when the fatal horse, descending down,<br/>
Pregnant with arms, o'erwhelm'd th' unhappy town<br/>
She feign'd nocturnal orgies; left my bed,<br/>
And, mix'd with Trojan dames, the dances led<br/>
Then, waving high her torch, the signal made,<br/>
Which rous'd the Grecians from their ambuscade.<br/>
With watching overworn, with cares oppress'd,<br/>
Unhappy I had laid me down to rest,<br/>
And heavy sleep my weary limbs possess'd.<br/>
Meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid,<br/>
And from beneath my head my sword convey'd;<br/>
The door unlatch'd, and, with repeated calls,<br/>
Invites her former lord within my walls.<br/>
Thus in her crime her confidence she plac'd,<br/>
And with new treasons would redeem the past.<br/>
What need I more? Into the room they ran,<br/>
And meanly murder'd a defenceless man.<br/>
Ulysses, basely born, first led the way.<br/>
Avenging pow'rs! with justice if I pray,<br/>
That fortune be their own another day!<br/>
But answer you; and in your turn relate,<br/>
What brought you, living, to the Stygian state:<br/>
Driv'n by the winds and errors of the sea,<br/>
Or did you Heav'n's superior doom obey?<br/>
Or tell what other chance conducts your way,<br/>
To view with mortal eyes our dark retreats,<br/>
Tumults and torments of th' infernal seats."
</p>
<p>
While thus in talk the flying hours they pass,<br/>
The sun had finish'd more than half his race:<br/>
And they, perhaps, in words and tears had spent<br/>
The little time of stay which Heav'n had lent;<br/>
But thus the Sibyl chides their long delay:<br/>
"Night rushes down, and headlong drives the day:<br/>
'Tis here, in different paths, the way divides;<br/>
The right to Pluto's golden palace guides;<br/>
The left to that unhappy region tends,<br/>
Which to the depth of Tartarus descends;<br/>
The seat of night profound, and punish'd fiends."<br/>
Then thus Deiphobus: "O sacred maid,<br/>
Forbear to chide, and be your will obey'd!<br/>
Lo! to the secret shadows I retire,<br/>
To pay my penance till my years expire.<br/>
Proceed, auspicious prince, with glory crown'd,<br/>
And born to better fates than I have found."<br/>
He said; and, while he said, his steps he turn'd<br/>
To secret shadows, and in silence mourn'd.
</p>
<p>
The hero, looking on the left, espied<br/>
A lofty tow'r, and strong on ev'ry side<br/>
With treble walls, which Phlegethon surrounds,<br/>
Whose fiery flood the burning empire bounds;<br/>
And, press'd betwixt the rocks, the bellowing noise resounds<br/>
Wide is the fronting gate, and, rais'd on high<br/>
With adamantine columns, threats the sky.<br/>
Vain is the force of man, and Heav'n's as vain,<br/>
To crush the pillars which the pile sustain.<br/>
Sublime on these a tow'r of steel is rear'd;<br/>
And dire Tisiphone there keeps the ward,<br/>
Girt in her sanguine gown, by night and day,<br/>
Observant of the souls that pass the downward way.<br/>
From hence are heard the groans of ghosts, the pains<br/>
Of sounding lashes and of dragging chains.<br/>
The Trojan stood astonish'd at their cries,<br/>
And ask'd his guide from whence those yells arise;<br/>
And what the crimes, and what the tortures were,<br/>
And loud laments that rent the liquid air.
</p>
<p>
She thus replied: "The chaste and holy race<br/>
Are all forbidden this polluted place.<br/>
But Hecate, when she gave to rule the woods,<br/>
Then led me trembling thro' these dire abodes,<br/>
And taught the tortures of th' avenging gods.<br/>
These are the realms of unrelenting fate;<br/>
And awful Rhadamanthus rules the state.<br/>
He hears and judges each committed crime;<br/>
Enquires into the manner, place, and time.<br/>
The conscious wretch must all his acts reveal,<br/>
Loth to confess, unable to conceal,<br/>
From the first moment of his vital breath,<br/>
To his last hour of unrepenting death.<br/>
Straight, o'er the guilty ghost, the Fury shakes<br/>
The sounding whip and brandishes her snakes,<br/>
And the pale sinner, with her sisters, takes.<br/>
Then, of itself, unfolds th' eternal door;<br/>
With dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar.<br/>
You see, before the gate, what stalking ghost<br/>
Commands the guard, what sentries keep the post.<br/>
More formidable Hydra stands within,<br/>
Whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin.<br/>
The gaping gulf low to the centre lies,<br/>
And twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies.<br/>
The rivals of the gods, the Titan race,<br/>
Here, sing'd with lightning, roll within th' unfathom'd space.<br/>
Here lie th' Alaean twins, (I saw them both,)<br/>
Enormous bodies, of gigantic growth,<br/>
Who dar'd in fight the Thund'rer to defy,<br/>
Affect his heav'n, and force him from the sky.<br/>
Salmoneus, suff'ring cruel pains, I found,<br/>
For emulating Jove; the rattling sound<br/>
Of mimic thunder, and the glitt'ring blaze<br/>
Of pointed lightnings, and their forky rays.<br/>
Thro' Elis and the Grecian towns he flew;<br/>
Th' audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew:<br/>
He wav'd a torch aloft, and, madly vain,<br/>
Sought godlike worship from a servile train.<br/>
Ambitious fool! with horny hoofs to pass<br/>
O'er hollow arches of resounding brass,<br/>
To rival thunder in its rapid course,<br/>
And imitate inimitable force!<br/>
But he, the King of Heav'n, obscure on high,<br/>
Bar'd his red arm, and, launching from the sky<br/>
His writhen bolt, not shaking empty smoke,<br/>
Down to the deep abyss the flaming felon strook.<br/>
There Tityus was to see, who took his birth<br/>
From heav'n, his nursing from the foodful earth.<br/>
Here his gigantic limbs, with large embrace,<br/>
Infold nine acres of infernal space.<br/>
A rav'nous vulture, in his open'd side,<br/>
Her crooked beak and cruel talons tried;<br/>
Still for the growing liver digg'd his breast;<br/>
The growing liver still supplied the feast;<br/>
Still are his entrails fruitful to their pains:<br/>
Th' immortal hunger lasts, th' immortal food remains.<br/>
Ixion and Perithous I could name,<br/>
And more Thessalian chiefs of mighty fame.<br/>
High o'er their heads a mould'ring rock is plac'd,<br/>
That promises a fall, and shakes at ev'ry blast.<br/>
They lie below, on golden beds display'd;<br/>
And genial feasts with regal pomp are made.<br/>
The Queen of Furies by their sides is set,<br/>
And snatches from their mouths th' untasted meat,<br/>
Which if they touch, her hissing snakes she rears,<br/>
Tossing her torch, and thund'ring in their ears.<br/>
Then they, who brothers' better claim disown,<br/>
Expel their parents, and usurp the throne;<br/>
Defraud their clients, and, to lucre sold,<br/>
Sit brooding on unprofitable gold;<br/>
Who dare not give, and ev'n refuse to lend<br/>
To their poor kindred, or a wanting friend.<br/>
Vast is the throng of these; nor less the train<br/>
Of lustful youths, for foul adult'ry slain:<br/>
Hosts of deserters, who their honour sold,<br/>
And basely broke their faith for bribes of gold.<br/>
All these within the dungeon's depth remain,<br/>
Despairing pardon, and expecting pain.<br/>
Ask not what pains; nor farther seek to know<br/>
Their process, or the forms of law below.<br/>
Some roll a weighty stone; some, laid along,<br/>
And bound with burning wires, on spokes of wheels are hung<br/>
Unhappy Theseus, doom'd for ever there,<br/>
Is fix'd by fate on his eternal chair;<br/>
And wretched Phlegyas warns the world with cries<br/>
(Could warning make the world more just or wise):<br/>
'Learn righteousness, and dread th' avenging deities.'<br/>
To tyrants others have their country sold,<br/>
Imposing foreign lords, for foreign gold;<br/>
Some have old laws repeal'd, new statutes made,<br/>
Not as the people pleas'd, but as they paid;<br/>
With incest some their daughters' bed profan'd:<br/>
All dar'd the worst of ills, and, what they dar'd, attain'd.<br/>
Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues,<br/>
And throats of brass, inspir'd with iron lungs,<br/>
I could not half those horrid crimes repeat,<br/>
Nor half the punishments those crimes have met.<br/>
But let us haste our voyage to pursue:<br/>
The walls of Pluto's palace are in view;<br/>
The gate, and iron arch above it, stands<br/>
On anvils labour'd by the Cyclops' hands.<br/>
Before our farther way the Fates allow,<br/>
Here must we fix on high the golden bough."
</p>
<p>
She said, and thro' the gloomy shades they pass'd,<br/>
And chose the middle path. Arriv'd at last,<br/>
The prince with living water sprinkled o'er<br/>
His limbs and body; then approach'd the door,<br/>
Possess'd the porch, and on the front above<br/>
He fix'd the fatal bough requir'd by Pluto's love.<br/>
These holy rites perform'd, they took their way<br/>
Where long extended plains of pleasure lay:<br/>
The verdant fields with those of heav'n may vie,<br/>
With ether vested, and a purple sky;<br/>
The blissful seats of happy souls below.<br/>
Stars of their own, and their own suns, they know;<br/>
Their airy limbs in sports they exercise,<br/>
And on the green contend the wrestler's prize.<br/>
Some in heroic verse divinely sing;<br/>
Others in artful measures led the ring.<br/>
The Thracian bard, surrounded by the rest,<br/>
There stands conspicuous in his flowing vest;<br/>
His flying fingers, and harmonious quill,<br/>
Strikes sev'n distinguish'd notes, and sev'n at once they fill.<br/>
Here found they Teucer's old heroic race,<br/>
Born better times and happier years to grace.<br/>
Assaracus and Ilus here enjoy<br/>
Perpetual fame, with him who founded Troy.<br/>
The chief beheld their chariots from afar,<br/>
Their shining arms, and coursers train'd to war:<br/>
Their lances fix'd in earth, their steeds around,<br/>
Free from their harness, graze the flow'ry ground.<br/>
The love of horses which they had, alive,<br/>
And care of chariots, after death survive.<br/>
Some cheerful souls were feasting on the plain;<br/>
Some did the song, and some the choir maintain,<br/>
Beneath a laurel shade, where mighty Po<br/>
Mounts up to woods above, and hides his head below.<br/>
Here patriots live, who, for their country's good,<br/>
In fighting fields, were prodigal of blood:<br/>
Priests of unblemish'd lives here make abode,<br/>
And poets worthy their inspiring god;<br/>
And searching wits, of more mechanic parts,<br/>
Who grac'd their age with new-invented arts:<br/>
Those who to worth their bounty did extend,<br/>
And those who knew that bounty to commend.<br/>
The heads of these with holy fillets bound,<br/>
And all their temples were with garlands crown'd.
</p>
<p>
To these the Sibyl thus her speech address'd,<br/>
And first to him surrounded by the rest<br/>
Tow'ring his height, and ample was his breast;<br/>
"Say, happy souls, divine Musaeus, say,<br/>
Where lives Anchises, and where lies our way<br/>
To find the hero, for whose only sake<br/>
We sought the dark abodes, and cross'd the bitter lake?"<br/>
To this the sacred poet thus replied:<br/>
"In no fix'd place the happy souls reside.<br/>
In groves we live, and lie on mossy beds,<br/>
By crystal streams, that murmur thro' the meads:<br/>
But pass yon easy hill, and thence descend;<br/>
The path conducts you to your journey's end."<br/>
This said, he led them up the mountain's brow,<br/>
And shews them all the shining fields below.<br/>
They wind the hill, and thro' the blissful meadows go.
</p>
<p>
But old Anchises, in a flow'ry vale,<br/>
Review'd his muster'd race, and took the tale:<br/>
Those happy spirits, which, ordain'd by fate,<br/>
For future beings and new bodies wait.<br/>
With studious thought observ'd th' illustrious throng,<br/>
In nature's order as they pass'd along:<br/>
Their names, their fates, their conduct, and their care,<br/>
In peaceful senates and successful war.<br/>
He, when Aeneas on the plain appears,<br/>
Meets him with open arms, and falling tears.<br/>
"Welcome," he said, "the gods' undoubted race!<br/>
O long expected to my dear embrace!<br/>
Once more 'tis giv'n me to behold your face!<br/>
The love and pious duty which you pay<br/>
Have pass'd the perils of so hard a way.<br/>
'Tis true, computing times, I now believ'd<br/>
The happy day approach'd; nor are my hopes deceiv'd.<br/>
What length of lands, what oceans have you pass'd;<br/>
What storms sustain'd, and on what shores been cast?<br/>
How have I fear'd your fate! but fear'd it most,<br/>
When love assail'd you, on the Libyan coast."<br/>
To this, the filial duty thus replies:<br/>
"Your sacred ghost before my sleeping eyes<br/>
Appear'd, and often urg'd this painful enterprise.<br/>
After long tossing on the Tyrrhene sea,<br/>
My navy rides at anchor in the bay.<br/>
But reach your hand, O parent shade, nor shun<br/>
The dear embraces of your longing son!"<br/>
He said; and falling tears his face bedew:<br/>
Then thrice around his neck his arms he threw;<br/>
And thrice the flitting shadow slipp'd away,<br/>
Like winds, or empty dreams that fly the day.
</p>
<p>
Now, in a secret vale, the Trojan sees<br/>
A sep'rate grove, thro' which a gentle breeze<br/>
Plays with a passing breath, and whispers thro' the trees;<br/>
And, just before the confines of the wood,<br/>
The gliding Lethe leads her silent flood.<br/>
About the boughs an airy nation flew,<br/>
Thick as the humming bees, that hunt the golden dew;<br/>
In summer's heat on tops of lilies feed,<br/>
And creep within their bells, to suck the balmy seed:<br/>
The winged army roams the fields around;<br/>
The rivers and the rocks remurmur to the sound.<br/>
Aeneas wond'ring stood, then ask'd the cause<br/>
Which to the stream the crowding people draws.<br/>
Then thus the sire: "The souls that throng the flood<br/>
Are those to whom, by fate, are other bodies ow'd:<br/>
In Lethe's lake they long oblivion taste,<br/>
Of future life secure, forgetful of the past.<br/>
Long has my soul desir'd this time and place,<br/>
To set before your sight your glorious race,<br/>
That this presaging joy may fire your mind<br/>
To seek the shores by destiny design'd."<br/>
"O father, can it be, that souls sublime<br/>
Return to visit our terrestrial clime,<br/>
And that the gen'rous mind, releas'd by death,<br/>
Can covet lazy limbs and mortal breath?"
</p>
<p>
Anchises then, in order, thus begun<br/>
To clear those wonders to his godlike son:<br/>
"Know, first, that heav'n, and earth's compacted frame,<br/>
And flowing waters, and the starry flame,<br/>
And both the radiant lights, one common soul<br/>
Inspires and feeds, and animates the whole.<br/>
This active mind, infus'd thro' all the space,<br/>
Unites and mingles with the mighty mass.<br/>
Hence men and beasts the breath of life obtain,<br/>
And birds of air, and monsters of the main.<br/>
Th' ethereal vigour is in all the same,<br/>
And every soul is fill'd with equal flame;<br/>
As much as earthy limbs, and gross allay<br/>
Of mortal members, subject to decay,<br/>
Blunt not the beams of heav'n and edge of day.<br/>
From this coarse mixture of terrestrial parts,<br/>
Desire and fear by turns possess their hearts,<br/>
And grief, and joy; nor can the groveling mind,<br/>
In the dark dungeon of the limbs confin'd,<br/>
Assert the native skies, or own its heav'nly kind:<br/>
Nor death itself can wholly wash their stains;<br/>
But long-contracted filth ev'n in the soul remains.<br/>
The relics of inveterate vice they wear,<br/>
And spots of sin obscene in ev'ry face appear.<br/>
For this are various penances enjoin'd;<br/>
And some are hung to bleach upon the wind,<br/>
Some plung'd in waters, others purg'd in fires,<br/>
Till all the dregs are drain'd, and all the rust expires.<br/>
All have their manes, and those manes bear:<br/>
The few, so cleans'd, to these abodes repair,<br/>
And breathe, in ample fields, the soft Elysian air.<br/>
Then are they happy, when by length of time<br/>
The scurf is worn away of each committed crime;<br/>
No speck is left of their habitual stains,<br/>
But the pure ether of the soul remains.<br/>
But, when a thousand rolling years are past,<br/>
(So long their punishments and penance last,)<br/>
Whole droves of minds are, by the driving god,<br/>
Compell'd to drink the deep Lethaean flood,<br/>
In large forgetful draughts to steep the cares<br/>
Of their past labours, and their irksome years,<br/>
That, unrememb'ring of its former pain,<br/>
The soul may suffer mortal flesh again."
</p>
<p>
Thus having said, the father spirit leads<br/>
The priestess and his son thro' swarms of shades,<br/>
And takes a rising ground, from thence to see<br/>
The long procession of his progeny.<br/>
"Survey," pursued the sire, "this airy throng,<br/>
As, offer'd to thy view, they pass along.<br/>
These are th' Italian names, which fate will join<br/>
With ours, and graff upon the Trojan line.<br/>
Observe the youth who first appears in sight,<br/>
And holds the nearest station to the light,<br/>
Already seems to snuff the vital air,<br/>
And leans just forward, on a shining spear:<br/>
Silvius is he, thy last-begotten race,<br/>
But first in order sent, to fill thy place;<br/>
An Alban name, but mix'd with Dardan blood,<br/>
Born in the covert of a shady wood:<br/>
Him fair Lavinia, thy surviving wife,<br/>
Shall breed in groves, to lead a solitary life.<br/>
In Alba he shall fix his royal seat,<br/>
And, born a king, a race of kings beget.<br/>
Then Procas, honour of the Trojan name,<br/>
Capys, and Numitor, of endless fame.<br/>
A second Silvius after these appears;<br/>
Silvius Aeneas, for thy name he bears;<br/>
For arms and justice equally renown'd,<br/>
Who, late restor'd, in Alba shall be crown'd.<br/>
How great they look! how vig'rously they wield<br/>
Their weighty lances, and sustain the shield!<br/>
But they, who crown'd with oaken wreaths appear,<br/>
Shall Gabian walls and strong Fidena rear;<br/>
Nomentum, Bola, with Pometia, found;<br/>
And raise Collatian tow'rs on rocky ground.<br/>
All these shall then be towns of mighty fame,<br/>
Tho' now they lie obscure, and lands without a name.<br/>
See Romulus the great, born to restore<br/>
The crown that once his injur'd grandsire wore.<br/>
This prince a priestess of your blood shall bear,<br/>
And like his sire in arms he shall appear.<br/>
Two rising crests, his royal head adorn;<br/>
Born from a god, himself to godhead born:<br/>
His sire already signs him for the skies,<br/>
And marks the seat amidst the deities.<br/>
Auspicious chief! thy race, in times to come,<br/>
Shall spread the conquests of imperial Rome.<br/>
Rome, whose ascending tow'rs shall heav'n invade,<br/>
Involving earth and ocean in her shade;<br/>
High as the Mother of the Gods in place,<br/>
And proud, like her, of an immortal race.<br/>
Then, when in pomp she makes the Phrygian round,<br/>
With golden turrets on her temples crown'd;<br/>
A hundred gods her sweeping train supply;<br/>
Her offspring all, and all command the sky.

<p>
"Now fix your sight, and stand intent, to see<br/>
Your Roman race, and Julian progeny.<br/>
The mighty Caesar waits his vital hour,<br/>
Impatient for the world, and grasps his promis'd pow'r.<br/>
But next behold the youth of form divine,<br/>
Caesar himself, exalted in his line;<br/>
Augustus, promis'd oft, and long foretold,<br/>
Sent to the realm that Saturn rul'd of old;<br/>
Born to restore a better age of gold.<br/>
Afric and India shall his pow'r obey;<br/>
He shall extend his propagated sway<br/>
Beyond the solar year, without the starry way,<br/>
Where Atlas turns the rolling heav'ns around,<br/>
And his broad shoulders with their lights are crown'd.<br/>
At his foreseen approach, already quake<br/>
The Caspian kingdoms and Maeotian lake:<br/>
Their seers behold the tempest from afar,<br/>
And threat'ning oracles denounce the war.<br/>
Nile hears him knocking at his sev'nfold gates,<br/>
And seeks his hidden spring, and fears his nephew's fates.<br/>
Nor Hercules more lands or labours knew,<br/>
Not tho' the brazen-footed hind he slew,<br/>
Freed Erymanthus from the foaming boar,<br/>
And dipp'd his arrows in Lernaean gore;<br/>
Nor Bacchus, turning from his Indian war,<br/>
By tigers drawn triumphant in his car,<br/>
From Nisus' top descending on the plains,<br/>
With curling vines around his purple reins.<br/>
And doubt we yet thro' dangers to pursue<br/>
The paths of honour, and a crown in view?<br/>
But what's the man, who from afar appears?<br/>
His head with olive crown'd, his hand a censer bears,<br/>
His hoary beard and holy vestments bring<br/>
His lost idea back: I know the Roman king.<br/>
He shall to peaceful Rome new laws ordain,<br/>
Call'd from his mean abode a scepter to sustain.<br/>
Him Tullus next in dignity succeeds,<br/>
An active prince, and prone to martial deeds.<br/>
He shall his troops for fighting fields prepare,<br/>
Disus'd to toils, and triumphs of the war.<br/>
By dint of sword his crown he shall increase,<br/>
And scour his armour from the rust of peace.<br/>
Whom Ancus follows, with a fawning air,<br/>
But vain within, and proudly popular.<br/>
Next view the Tarquin kings, th' avenging sword<br/>
Of Brutus, justly drawn, and Rome restor'd.<br/>
He first renews the rods and ax severe,<br/>
And gives the consuls royal robes to wear.<br/>
His sons, who seek the tyrant to sustain,<br/>
And long for arbitrary lords again,<br/>
With ignominy scourg'd, in open sight,<br/>
He dooms to death deserv'd, asserting public right.<br/>
Unhappy man, to break the pious laws<br/>
Of nature, pleading in his children's cause!<br/>
Howe'er the doubtful fact is understood,<br/>
'Tis love of honour, and his country's good:<br/>
The consul, not the father, sheds the blood.<br/>
Behold Torquatus the same track pursue;<br/>
And, next, the two devoted Decii view:<br/>
The Drusian line, Camillus loaded home<br/>
With standards well redeem'd, and foreign foes o'ercome<br/>
The pair you see in equal armour shine,<br/>
Now, friends below, in close embraces join;<br/>
But, when they leave the shady realms of night,<br/>
And, cloth'd in bodies, breathe your upper light,<br/>
With mortal hate each other shall pursue:<br/>
What wars, what wounds, what slaughter shall ensue!<br/>
From Alpine heights the father first descends;<br/>
His daughter's husband in the plain attends:<br/>
His daughter's husband arms his eastern friends.<br/>
Embrace again, my sons, be foes no more;<br/>
Nor stain your country with her children's gore!<br/>
And thou, the first, lay down thy lawless claim,<br/>
Thou, of my blood, who bear'st the Julian name!<br/>
Another comes, who shall in triumph ride,<br/>
And to the Capitol his chariot guide,<br/>
From conquer'd Corinth, rich with Grecian spoils.<br/>
And yet another, fam'd for warlike toils,<br/>
On Argos shall impose the Roman laws,<br/>
And on the Greeks revenge the Trojan cause;<br/>
Shall drag in chains their Achillean race;<br/>
Shall vindicate his ancestors' disgrace,<br/>
And Pallas, for her violated place.<br/>
Great Cato there, for gravity renown'd,<br/>
And conqu'ring Cossus goes with laurels crown'd.<br/>
Who can omit the Gracchi? who declare<br/>
The Scipios' worth, those thunderbolts of war,<br/>
The double bane of Carthage? Who can see<br/>
Without esteem for virtuous poverty,<br/>
Severe Fabricius, or can cease t' admire<br/>
The plowman consul in his coarse attire?<br/>
Tir'd as I am, my praise the Fabii claim;<br/>
And thou, great hero, greatest of thy name,<br/>
Ordain'd in war to save the sinking state,<br/>
And, by delays, to put a stop to fate!<br/>
Let others better mould the running mass<br/>
Of metals, and inform the breathing brass,<br/>
And soften into flesh a marble face;<br/>
Plead better at the bar; describe the skies,<br/>
And when the stars descend, and when they rise.<br/>
But, Rome, 'tis thine alone, with awful sway,<br/>
To rule mankind, and make the world obey,<br/>
Disposing peace and war by thy own majestic way;<br/>
To tame the proud, the fetter'd slave to free:<br/>
These are imperial arts, and worthy thee."
</p>
<p>
He paus'd; and, while with wond'ring eyes they view'd<br/>
The passing spirits, thus his speech renew'd:<br/>
"See great Marcellus! how, untir'd in toils,<br/>
He moves with manly grace, how rich with regal spoils!<br/>
He, when his country, threaten'd with alarms,<br/>
Requires his courage and his conqu'ring arms,<br/>
Shall more than once the Punic bands affright;<br/>
Shall kill the Gaulish king in single fight;<br/>
Then to the Capitol in triumph move,<br/>
And the third spoils shall grace Feretrian Jove."<br/>
Aeneas here beheld, of form divine,<br/>
A godlike youth in glitt'ring armour shine,<br/>
With great Marcellus keeping equal pace;<br/>
But gloomy were his eyes, dejected was his face.<br/>
He saw, and, wond'ring, ask'd his airy guide,<br/>
What and of whence was he, who press'd the hero's side:<br/>
"His son, or one of his illustrious name?<br/>
How like the former, and almost the same!<br/>
Observe the crowds that compass him around;<br/>
All gaze, and all admire, and raise a shouting sound:<br/>
But hov'ring mists around his brows are spread,<br/>
And night, with sable shades, involves his head."<br/>
"Seek not to know," the ghost replied with tears,<br/>
"The sorrows of thy sons in future years.<br/>
This youth (the blissful vision of a day)<br/>
Shall just be shown on earth, and snatch'd away.<br/>
The gods too high had rais'd the Roman state,<br/>
Were but their gifts as permanent as great.<br/>
What groans of men shall fill the Martian field!<br/>
How fierce a blaze his flaming pile shall yield!<br/>
What fun'ral pomp shall floating Tiber see,<br/>
When, rising from his bed, he views the sad solemnity!<br/>
No youth shall equal hopes of glory give,<br/>
No youth afford so great a cause to grieve;<br/>
The Trojan honour, and the Roman boast,<br/>
Admir'd when living, and ador'd when lost!<br/>
Mirror of ancient faith in early youth!<br/>
Undaunted worth, inviolable truth!<br/>
No foe, unpunish'd, in the fighting field<br/>
Shall dare thee, foot to foot, with sword and shield;<br/>
Much less in arms oppose thy matchless force,<br/>
When thy sharp spurs shall urge thy foaming horse.<br/>
Ah! couldst thou break thro' fate's severe decree,<br/>
A new Marcellus shall arise in thee!<br/>
Full canisters of fragrant lilies bring,<br/>
Mix'd with the purple roses of the spring;<br/>
Let me with fun'ral flow'rs his body strow;<br/>
This gift which parents to their children owe,<br/>
This unavailing gift, at least, I may bestow!"<br/>
Thus having said, he led the hero round<br/>
The confines of the blest Elysian ground;<br/>
Which when Anchises to his son had shown,<br/>
And fir'd his mind to mount the promis'd throne,<br/>
He tells the future wars, ordain'd by fate;<br/>
The strength and customs of the Latian state;<br/>
The prince, and people; and forearms his care<br/>
With rules, to push his fortune, or to bear.
</p>
<p>
Two gates the silent house of Sleep adorn;<br/>
Of polish'd ivory this, that of transparent horn:<br/>
True visions thro' transparent horn arise;<br/>
Thro' polish'd ivory pass deluding lies.<br/>
Of various things discoursing as he pass'd,<br/>
Anchises hither bends his steps at last.<br/>
Then, thro' the gate of iv'ry, he dismiss'd<br/>
His valiant offspring and divining guest.<br/>
Straight to the ships Aeneas took his way,<br/>
Embark'd his men, and skimm'd along the sea,<br/>
Still coasting, till he gain'd Cajeta's bay.<br/>
At length on oozy ground his galleys moor;<br/>
Their heads are turn'd to sea, their sterns to shore.

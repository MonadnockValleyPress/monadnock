<h1>Aeneid</h1>
<h2>by Virgil</h2>
<h3>Book XII</h3>
<p>
When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field,<br/>
Their armies broken, and their courage quell'd,<br/>
Himself become the mark of public spite,<br/>
His honour question'd for the promis'd fight;<br/>
The more he was with vulgar hate oppress'd,<br/>
The more his fury boil'd within his breast:<br/>
He rous'd his vigour for the last debate,<br/>
And rais'd his haughty soul to meet his fate.
</p>
<p>
As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase,<br/>
He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace;<br/>
But, if the pointed jav'lin pierce his side,<br/>
The lordly beast returns with double pride:<br/>
He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain;<br/>
His sides he lashes, and erects his mane:<br/>
So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire,<br/>
Thro' his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire.
</p>
<p>
Trembling with rage, around the court he ran,<br/>
At length approach'd the king, and thus began:<br/>
"No more excuses or delays: I stand<br/>
In arms prepar'd to combat, hand to hand,<br/>
This base deserter of his native land.<br/>
The Trojan, by his word, is bound to take<br/>
The same conditions which himself did make.<br/>
Renew the truce; the solemn rites prepare,<br/>
And to my single virtue trust the war.<br/>
The Latians unconcern'd shall see the fight;<br/>
This arm unaided shall assert your right:<br/>
Then, if my prostrate body press the plain,<br/>
To him the crown and beauteous bride remain."
</p>
<p>
To whom the king sedately thus replied:<br/>
"Brave youth, the more your valour has been tried,<br/>
The more becomes it us, with due respect,<br/>
To weigh the chance of war, which you neglect.<br/>
You want not wealth, or a successive throne,<br/>
Or cities which your arms have made your own:<br/>
My towns and treasures are at your command,<br/>
And stor'd with blooming beauties is my land;<br/>
Laurentum more than one Lavinia sees,<br/>
Unmarried, fair, of noble families.<br/>
Now let me speak, and you with patience hear,<br/>
Things which perhaps may grate a lover's ear,<br/>
But sound advice, proceeding from a heart<br/>
Sincerely yours, and free from fraudful art.<br/>
The gods, by signs, have manifestly shown,<br/>
No prince Italian born should heir my throne:<br/>
Oft have our augurs, in prediction skill'd,<br/>
And oft our priests, a foreign son reveal'd.<br/>
Yet, won by worth that cannot be withstood,<br/>
Brib'd by my kindness to my kindred blood,<br/>
Urg'd by my wife, who would not be denied,<br/>
I promis'd my Lavinia for your bride:<br/>
Her from her plighted lord by force I took;<br/>
All ties of treaties, and of honour, broke:<br/>
On your account I wag'd an impious warâ€”<br/>
With what success, 'tis needless to declare;<br/>
I and my subjects feel, and you have had your share.<br/>
Twice vanquish'd while in bloody fields we strive,<br/>
Scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive:<br/>
The rolling flood runs warm with human gore;<br/>
The bones of Latians blanch the neighb'ring shore.<br/>
Why put I not an end to this debate,<br/>
Still unresolv'd, and still a slave to fate?<br/>
If Turnus' death a lasting peace can give,<br/>
Why should I not procure it whilst you live?<br/>
Should I to doubtful arms your youth betray,<br/>
What would my kinsmen, the Rutulians, say?<br/>
And, should you fall in fight, (which Heav'n defend!)<br/>
How curse the cause which hasten'd to his end<br/>
The daughter's lover and the father's friend?<br/>
Weigh in your mind the various chance of war;<br/>
Pity your parent's age, and ease his care."
</p>
<p>
Such balmy words he pour'd, but all in vain:<br/>
The proffer'd med'cine but provok'd the pain.<br/>
The wrathful youth, disdaining the relief,<br/>
With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief:<br/>
"The care, O best of fathers, which you take<br/>
For my concerns, at my desire forsake.<br/>
Permit me not to languish out my days,<br/>
But make the best exchange of life for praise.<br/>
This arm, this lance, can well dispute the prize;<br/>
And the blood follows, where the weapon flies.<br/>
His goddess mother is not near, to shroud<br/>
The flying coward with an empty cloud."
</p>
<p>
But now the queen, who fear'd for Turnus' life,<br/>
And loath'd the hard conditions of the strife,<br/>
Held him by force; and, dying in his death,<br/>
In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath:<br/>
"O Turnus, I adjure thee by these tears,<br/>
And whate'er price Amata's honour bears<br/>
Within thy breast, since thou art all my hope,<br/>
My sickly mind's repose, my sinking age's prop;<br/>
Since on the safety of thy life alone<br/>
Depends Latinus, and the Latian throne:<br/>
Refuse me not this one, this only pray'r,<br/>
To waive the combat, and pursue the war.<br/>
Whatever chance attends this fatal strife,<br/>
Think it includes, in thine, Amata's life.<br/>
I cannot live a slave, or see my throne<br/>
Usurp'd by strangers or a Trojan son."
</p>
<p>
At this, a flood of tears Lavinia shed;<br/>
A crimson blush her beauteous face o'erspread,<br/>
Varying her cheeks by turns with white and red.<br/>
The driving colours, never at a stay,<br/>
Run here and there, and flush, and fade away.<br/>
Delightful change! Thus Indian iv'ry shows,<br/>
Which with the bord'ring paint of purple glows;<br/>
Or lilies damask'd by the neighb'ring rose.
</p>
<p>
The lover gaz'd, and, burning with desire,<br/>
The more he look'd, the more he fed the fire:<br/>
Revenge, and jealous rage, and secret spite,<br/>
Roll in his breast, and rouse him to the fight.<br/>
Then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes,<br/>
Firm to his first intent, he thus replies:<br/>
"O mother, do not by your tears prepare<br/>
Such boding omens, and prejudge the war.<br/>
Resolv'd on fight, I am no longer free<br/>
To shun my death, if Heav'n my death decree."<br/>
Then turning to the herald, thus pursues:<br/>
"Go, greet the Trojan with ungrateful news;<br/>
Denounce from me, that, when tomorrow's light<br/>
Shall gild the heav'ns, he need not urge the fight;<br/>
The Trojan and Rutulian troops no more<br/>
Shall dye, with mutual blood, the Latian shore:<br/>
Our single swords the quarrel shall decide,<br/>
And to the victor be the beauteous bride."
</p>
<p>
He said, and striding on, with speedy pace,<br/>
He sought his coursers of the Thracian race.<br/>
At his approach they toss their heads on high,<br/>
And, proudly neighing, promise victory.<br/>
The sires of these Orythia sent from far,<br/>
To grace Pilumnus, when he went to war.<br/>
The drifts of Thracian snows were scarce so white,<br/>
Nor northern winds in fleetness match'd their flight.<br/>
Officious grooms stand ready by his side;<br/>
And some with combs their flowing manes divide,<br/>
And others stroke their chests and gently soothe their pride.
</p>
<p>
He sheath'd his limbs in arms; a temper'd mass<br/>
Of golden metal those, and mountain brass.<br/>
Then to his head his glitt'ring helm he tied,<br/>
And girt his faithful falchion to his side.<br/>
In his Aetnaean forge, the God of Fire<br/>
That falchion labour'd for the hero's sire;<br/>
Immortal keenness on the blade bestow'd,<br/>
And plung'd it hissing in the Stygian flood.<br/>
Propp'd on a pillar, which the ceiling bore,<br/>
Was plac'd the lance Auruncan Actor wore;<br/>
Which with such force he brandish'd in his hand,<br/>
The tough ash trembled like an osier wand:<br/>
Then cried: "O pond'rous spoil of Actor slain,<br/>
And never yet by Turnus toss'd in vain,<br/>
Fail not this day thy wonted force; but go,<br/>
Sent by this hand, to pierce the Trojan foe!<br/>
Give me to tear his corslet from his breast,<br/>
And from that eunuch head to rend the crest;<br/>
Dragg'd in the dust, his frizzled hair to soil,<br/>
Hot from the vexing ir'n, and smear'd with fragrant oil!"
</p>
<p>
Thus while he raves, from his wide nostrils flies<br/>
A fiery steam, and sparkles from his eyes.<br/>
So fares the bull in his lov'd female's sight:<br/>
Proudly he bellows, and preludes the fight;<br/>
He tries his goring horns against a tree,<br/>
And meditates his absent enemy;<br/>
He pushes at the winds; he digs the strand<br/>
With his black hoofs, and spurns the yellow sand.
</p>
<p>
Nor less the Trojan, in his Lemnian arms,<br/>
To future fight his manly courage warms:<br/>
He whets his fury, and with joy prepares<br/>
To terminate at once the ling'ring wars;<br/>
To cheer his chiefs and tender son, relates<br/>
What Heav'n had promis'd, and expounds the fates.<br/>
Then to the Latian king he sends, to cease<br/>
The rage of arms, and ratify the peace.
</p>
<p>
The morn ensuing, from the mountain's height,<br/>
Had scarcely spread the skies with rosy light;<br/>
Th' ethereal coursers, bounding from the sea,<br/>
From out their flaming nostrils breath'd the day;<br/>
When now the Trojan and Rutulian guard,<br/>
In friendly labour join'd, the list prepar'd.<br/>
Beneath the walls they measure out the space;<br/>
Then sacred altars rear, on sods of grass,<br/>
Where, with religious rites their common gods they place.<br/>
In purest white the priests their heads attire;<br/>
And living waters bear, and holy fire;<br/>
And, o'er their linen hoods and shaded hair,<br/>
Long twisted wreaths of sacred vervain wear.
</p>
<p>
In order issuing from the town appears<br/>
The Latin legion, arm'd with pointed spears;<br/>
And from the fields, advancing on a line,<br/>
The Trojan and the Tuscan forces join:<br/>
Their various arms afford a pleasing sight;<br/>
A peaceful train they seem, in peace prepar'd for fight.<br/>
Betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride,<br/>
Glitt'ring with gold, and vests in purple dyed;<br/>
Here Mnestheus, author of the Memmian line,<br/>
And there Messapus, born of seed divine.<br/>
The sign is giv'n; and, round the listed space,<br/>
Each man in order fills his proper place.<br/>
Reclining on their ample shields, they stand,<br/>
And fix their pointed lances in the sand.<br/>
Now, studious of the sight, a num'rous throng<br/>
Of either sex promiscuous, old and young,<br/>
Swarm the town: by those who rest behind,<br/>
The gates and walls and houses' tops are lin'd.<br/>
Meantime the Queen of Heav'n beheld the sight,<br/>
With eyes unpleas'd, from Mount Albano's height<br/>
(Since call'd Albano by succeeding fame,<br/>
But then an empty hill, without a name).<br/>
She thence survey'd the field, the Trojan pow'rs,<br/>
The Latian squadrons, and Laurentine tow'rs.<br/>
Then thus the goddess of the skies bespoke,<br/>
With sighs and tears, the goddess of the lake,<br/>
King Turnus' sister, once a lovely maid,<br/>
Ere to the lust of lawless Jove betray'd:<br/>
Compress'd by force, but, by the grateful god,<br/>
Now made the Nais of the neighb'ring flood.<br/>
"O nymph, the pride of living lakes," said she,<br/>
"O most renown'd, and most belov'd by me,<br/>
Long hast thou known, nor need I to record,<br/>
The wanton sallies of my wand'ring lord.<br/>
Of ev'ry Latian fair whom Jove misled<br/>
To mount by stealth my violated bed,<br/>
To thee alone I grudg'd not his embrace,<br/>
But gave a part of heav'n, and an unenvied place.<br/>
Now learn from me thy near approaching grief,<br/>
Nor think my wishes want to thy relief.<br/>
While fortune favour'd, nor Heav'n's King denied<br/>
To lend my succour to the Latian side,<br/>
I sav'd thy brother, and the sinking state:<br/>
But now he struggles with unequal fate,<br/>
And goes, with gods averse, o'ermatch'd in might,<br/>
To meet inevitable death in fight;<br/>
Nor must I break the truce, nor can sustain the sight.<br/>
Thou, if thou dar'st thy present aid supply;<br/>
It well becomes a sister's care to try."
</p>
<p>
At this the lovely nymph, with grief oppress'd,<br/>
Thrice tore her hair, and beat her comely breast.<br/>
To whom Saturnia thus: "Thy tears are late:<br/>
Haste, snatch him, if he can be snatch'd from fate:<br/>
New tumults kindle; violate the truce:<br/>
Who knows what changeful fortune may produce?<br/>
'Tis not a crime t' attempt what I decree;<br/>
Or, if it were, discharge the crime on me."<br/>
She said, and, sailing on the winged wind,<br/>
Left the sad nymph suspended in her mind.
</p>
<p>
And now in pomp the peaceful kings appear:<br/>
Four steeds the chariot of Latinus bear;<br/>
Twelve golden beams around his temples play,<br/>
To mark his lineage from the God of Day.<br/>
Two snowy coursers Turnus' chariot yoke,<br/>
And in his hand two massy spears he shook:<br/>
Then issued from the camp, in arms divine,<br/>
Aeneas, author of the Roman line;<br/>
And by his side Ascanius took his place,<br/>
The second hope of Rome's immortal race.<br/>
Adorn'd in white, a rev'rend priest appears,<br/>
And off'rings to the flaming altars bears;<br/>
A porket, and a lamb that never suffer'd shears.<br/>
Then to the rising sun he turns his eyes,<br/>
And strews the beasts, design'd for sacrifice,<br/>
With salt and meal: with like officious care<br/>
He marks their foreheads, and he clips their hair.<br/>
Betwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds;<br/>
With the same gen'rous juice the flame he feeds.
</p>
<p>
Aeneas then unsheath'd his shining sword,<br/>
And thus with pious pray'rs the gods ador'd:<br/>
"All-seeing sun, and thou, Ausonian soil,<br/>
For which I have sustain'd so long a toil,<br/>
Thou, King of Heav'n, and thou, the Queen of Air,<br/>
Propitious now, and reconcil'd by pray'r;<br/>
Thou, God of War, whose unresisted sway<br/>
The labours and events of arms obey;<br/>
Ye living fountains, and ye running floods,<br/>
All pow'rs of ocean, all ethereal gods,<br/>
Hear, and bear record: if I fall in field,<br/>
Or, recreant in the fight, to Turnus yield,<br/>
My Trojans shall encrease Evander's town;<br/>
Ascanius shall renounce th' Ausonian crown:<br/>
All claims, all questions of debate, shall cease;<br/>
Nor he, nor they, with force infringe the peace.<br/>
But, if my juster arms prevail in fight,<br/>
(As sure they shall, if I divine aright,)<br/>
My Trojans shall not o'er th' Italians reign:<br/>
Both equal, both unconquer'd shall remain,<br/>
Join'd in their laws, their lands, and their abodes;<br/>
I ask but altars for my weary gods.<br/>
The care of those religious rites be mine;<br/>
The crown to King Latinus I resign:<br/>
His be the sov'reign sway. Nor will I share<br/>
His pow'r in peace, or his command in war.<br/>
For me, my friends another town shall frame,<br/>
And bless the rising tow'rs with fair Lavinia's name."
</p>
<p>
Thus he. Then, with erected eyes and hands,<br/>
The Latian king before his altar stands.<br/>
"By the same heav'n," said he, "and earth, and main,<br/>
And all the pow'rs that all the three contain;<br/>
By hell below, and by that upper god<br/>
Whose thunder signs the peace, who seals it with his nod;<br/>
So let Latona's double offspring hear,<br/>
And double-fronted Janus, what I swear:<br/>
I touch the sacred altars, touch the flames,<br/>
And all those pow'rs attest, and all their names;<br/>
Whatever chance befall on either side,<br/>
No term of time this union shall divide:<br/>
No force, no fortune, shall my vows unbind,<br/>
Or shake the steadfast tenor of my mind;<br/>
Not tho' the circling seas should break their bound,<br/>
O'erflow the shores, or sap the solid ground;<br/>
Not tho' the lamps of heav'n their spheres forsake,<br/>
Hurl'd down, and hissing in the nether lake:<br/>
Ev'n as this royal scepter" (for he bore<br/>
A scepter in his hand) "shall never more<br/>
Shoot out in branches, or renew the birth:<br/>
An orphan now, cut from the mother earth<br/>
By the keen ax, dishonour'd of its hair,<br/>
And cas'd in brass, for Latian kings to bear."
</p>
<p>
When thus in public view the peace was tied<br/>
With solemn vows, and sworn on either side,<br/>
All dues perform'd which holy rites require;<br/>
The victim beasts are slain before the fire,<br/>
The trembling entrails from their bodies torn,<br/>
And to the fatten'd flames in chargers borne.
</p>
<p>
Already the Rutulians deem their man<br/>
O'ermatch'd in arms, before the fight began.<br/>
First rising fears are whisper'd thro' the crowd;<br/>
Then, gath'ring sound, they murmur more aloud.<br/>
Now, side to side, they measure with their eyes<br/>
The champions' bulk, their sinews, and their size:<br/>
The nearer they approach, the more is known<br/>
Th' apparent disadvantage of their own.<br/>
Turnus himself appears in public sight<br/>
Conscious of fate, desponding of the fight.<br/>
Slowly he moves, and at his altar stands<br/>
With eyes dejected, and with trembling hands;<br/>
And, while he mutters undistinguish'd pray'rs,<br/>
A livid deadness in his cheeks appears.
</p>
<p>
With anxious pleasure when Juturna view'd<br/>
Th' increasing fright of the mad multitude,<br/>
When their short sighs and thick'ning sobs she heard,<br/>
And found their ready minds for change prepar'd;<br/>
Dissembling her immortal form, she took<br/>
Camertus' mien, his habit, and his look;<br/>
A chief of ancient blood; in arms well known<br/>
Was his great sire, and he his greater son.<br/>
His shape assum'd, amid the ranks she ran,<br/>
And humoring their first motions, thus began:<br/>
"For shame, Rutulians, can you bear the sight<br/>
Of one expos'd for all, in single fight?<br/>
Can we, before the face of heav'n, confess<br/>
Our courage colder, or our numbers less?<br/>
View all the Trojan host, th' Arcadian band,<br/>
And Tuscan army; count 'em as they stand:<br/>
Undaunted to the battle if we go,<br/>
Scarce ev'ry second man will share a foe.<br/>
Turnus, 'tis true, in this unequal strife,<br/>
Shall lose, with honour, his devoted life,<br/>
Or change it rather for immortal fame,<br/>
Succeeding to the gods, from whence he came:<br/>
But you, a servile and inglorious band,<br/>
For foreign lords shall sow your native land,<br/>
Those fruitful fields your fighting fathers gain'd,<br/>
Which have so long their lazy sons sustain'd."<br/>
With words like these, she carried her design:<br/>
A rising murmur runs along the line.<br/>
Then ev'n the city troops, and Latians, tir'd<br/>
With tedious war, seem with new souls inspir'd:<br/>
Their champion's fate with pity they lament,<br/>
And of the league, so lately sworn, repent.
</p>
<p>
Nor fails the goddess to foment the rage<br/>
With lying wonders, and a false presage;<br/>
But adds a sign, which, present to their eyes,<br/>
Inspires new courage, and a glad surprise.<br/>
For, sudden, in the fiery tracts above,<br/>
Appears in pomp th' imperial bird of Jove:<br/>
A plump of fowl he spies, that swim the lakes,<br/>
And o'er their heads his sounding pinions shakes;<br/>
Then, stooping on the fairest of the train,<br/>
In his strong talons truss'd a silver swan.<br/>
Th' Italians wonder at th' unusual sight;<br/>
But, while he lags, and labours in his flight,<br/>
Behold, the dastard fowl return anew,<br/>
And with united force the foe pursue:<br/>
Clam'rous around the royal hawk they fly,<br/>
And, thick'ning in a cloud, o'ershade the sky.<br/>
They cuff, they scratch, they cross his airy course;<br/>
Nor can th' incumber'd bird sustain their force;<br/>
But vex'd, not vanquish'd, drops the pond'rous prey,<br/>
And, lighten'd of his burthen, wings his way.
</p>
<p>
Th' Ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight,<br/>
Eager of action, and demand the fight.<br/>
Then King Tolumnius, vers'd in augurs' arts,<br/>
Cries out, and thus his boasted skill imparts:<br/>
"At length 'tis granted, what I long desir'd!<br/>
This, this is what my frequent vows requir'd.<br/>
Ye gods, I take your omen, and obey.<br/>
Advance, my friends, and charge! I lead the way.<br/>
These are the foreign foes, whose impious band,<br/>
Like that rapacious bird, infest our land:<br/>
But soon, like him, they shall be forc'd to sea<br/>
By strength united, and forego the prey.<br/>
Your timely succour to your country bring,<br/>
Haste to the rescue, and redeem your king."
</p>
<p>
He said; and, pressing onward thro' the crew,<br/>
Pois'd in his lifted arm, his lance he threw.<br/>
The winged weapon, whistling in the wind,<br/>
Came driving on, nor miss'd the mark design'd.<br/>
At once the cornel rattled in the skies;<br/>
At once tumultuous shouts and clamours rise.<br/>
Nine brothers in a goodly band there stood,<br/>
Born of Arcadian mix'd with Tuscan blood,<br/>
Gylippus' sons: the fatal jav'lin flew,<br/>
Aim'd at the midmost of the friendly crew.<br/>
A passage thro' the jointed arms it found,<br/>
Just where the belt was to the body bound,<br/>
And struck the gentle youth extended on the ground.<br/>
Then, fir'd with pious rage, the gen'rous train<br/>
Run madly forward to revenge the slain.<br/>
And some with eager haste their jav'lins throw;<br/>
And some with sword in hand assault the foe.
</p>
<p>
The wish'd insult the Latine troops embrace,<br/>
And meet their ardour in the middle space.<br/>
The Trojans, Tuscans, and Arcadian line,<br/>
With equal courage obviate their design.<br/>
Peace leaves the violated fields, and hate<br/>
Both armies urges to their mutual fate.<br/>
With impious haste their altars are o'erturn'd,<br/>
The sacrifice half-broil'd, and half-unburn'd.<br/>
Thick storms of steel from either army fly,<br/>
And clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky;<br/>
Brands from the fire are missive weapons made,<br/>
With chargers, bowls, and all the priestly trade.<br/>
Latinus, frighted, hastens from the fray,<br/>
And bears his unregarded gods away.<br/>
These on their horses vault; those yoke the car;<br/>
The rest, with swords on high, run headlong to the war.
</p>
<p>
Messapus, eager to confound the peace,<br/>
Spurr'd his hot courser thro' the fighting press,<br/>
At King Aulestes, by his purple known<br/>
A Tuscan prince, and by his regal crown;<br/>
And, with a shock encount'ring, bore him down.<br/>
Backward he fell; and, as his fate design'd,<br/>
The ruins of an altar were behind:<br/>
There, pitching on his shoulders and his head,<br/>
Amid the scatt'ring fires he lay supinely spread.<br/>
The beamy spear, descending from above,<br/>
His cuirass pierc'd, and thro' his body drove.<br/>
Then, with a scornful smile, the victor cries:<br/>
"The gods have found a fitter sacrifice."<br/>
Greedy of spoils, th' Italians strip the dead<br/>
Of his rich armour, and uncrown his head.
</p>
<p>
Priest Corynaeus, arm'd his better hand,<br/>
From his own altar, with a blazing brand;<br/>
And, as Ebusus with a thund'ring pace<br/>
Advanc'd to battle, dash'd it on his face:<br/>
His bristly beard shines out with sudden fires;<br/>
The crackling crop a noisome scent expires.<br/>
Following the blow, he seiz'd his curling crown<br/>
With his left hand; his other cast him down.<br/>
The prostrate body with his knees he press'd,<br/>
And plung'd his holy poniard in his breast.
</p>
<p>
While Podalirius, with his sword, pursued<br/>
The shepherd Alsus thro' the flying crowd,<br/>
Swiftly he turns, and aims a deadly blow<br/>
Full on the front of his unwary foe.<br/>
The broad ax enters with a crashing sound,<br/>
And cleaves the chin with one continued wound;<br/>
Warm blood, and mingled brains, besmear his arms around;<br/>
An iron sleep his stupid eyes oppress'd,<br/>
And seal'd their heavy lids in endless rest.
</p>
<p>
But good Aeneas rush'd amid the bands;<br/>
Bare was his head, and naked were his hands,<br/>
In sign of truce: then thus he cries aloud:<br/>
"What sudden rage, what new desire of blood,<br/>
Inflames your alter'd minds? O Trojans, cease<br/>
From impious arms, nor violate the peace!<br/>
By human sanctions, and by laws divine,<br/>
The terms are all agreed; the war is mine.<br/>
Dismiss your fears, and let the fight ensue;<br/>
This hand alone shall right the gods and you:<br/>
Our injur'd altars, and their broken vow,<br/>
To this avenging sword the faithless Turnus owe."
</p>
<p>
Thus while he spoke, unmindful of defence,<br/>
A winged arrow struck the pious prince.<br/>
But, whether from some human hand it came,<br/>
Or hostile god, is left unknown by fame:<br/>
No human hand or hostile god was found,<br/>
To boast the triumph of so base a wound.
</p>
<p>
When Turnus saw the Trojan quit the plain,<br/>
His chiefs dismay'd, his troops a fainting train,<br/>
Th' unhop'd event his heighten'd soul inspires:<br/>
At once his arms and coursers he requires;<br/>
Then, with a leap, his lofty chariot gains,<br/>
And with a ready hand assumes the reins.<br/>
He drives impetuous, and, where'er he goes,<br/>
He leaves behind a lane of slaughter'd foes.<br/>
These his lance reaches; over those he rolls<br/>
His rapid car, and crushes out their souls:<br/>
In vain the vanquish'd fly; the victor sends<br/>
The dead men's weapons at their living friends.<br/>
Thus, on the banks of Hebrus' freezing flood,<br/>
The God of Battles, in his angry mood,<br/>
Clashing his sword against his brazen shield,<br/>
Let loose the reins, and scours along the field:<br/>
Before the wind his fiery coursers fly;<br/>
Groans the sad earth, resounds the rattling sky.<br/>
Wrath, Terror, Treason, Tumult, and Despair<br/>
(Dire faces, and deform'd) surround the car;<br/>
Friends of the god, and followers of the war.<br/>
With fury not unlike, nor less disdain,<br/>
Exulting Turnus flies along the plain:<br/>
His smoking horses, at their utmost speed,<br/>
He lashes on, and urges o'er the dead.<br/>
Their fetlocks run with blood; and, when they bound,<br/>
The gore and gath'ring dust are dash'd around.<br/>
Thamyris and Pholus, masters of the war,<br/>
He kill'd at hand, but Sthenelus afar:<br/>
From far the sons of Imbracus he slew,<br/>
Glaucus and Lades, of the Lycian crew;<br/>
Both taught to fight on foot, in battle join'd,<br/>
Or mount the courser that outstrips the wind.
</p>
<p>
Meantime Eumedes, vaunting in the field,<br/>
New fir'd the Trojans, and their foes repell'd.<br/>
This son of Dolon bore his grandsire's name,<br/>
But emulated more his father's fame;<br/>
His guileful father, sent a nightly spy,<br/>
The Grecian camp and order to descry:<br/>
Hard enterprise! and well he might require<br/>
Achilles' car and horses, for his hire:<br/>
But, met upon the scout, th' Aetolian prince<br/>
In death bestow'd a juster recompense.<br/>
Fierce Turnus view'd the Trojan from afar,<br/>
And launch'd his jav'lin from his lofty car;<br/>
Then lightly leaping down, pursued the blow,<br/>
And, pressing with his foot his prostrate foe,<br/>
Wrench'd from his feeble hold the shining sword,<br/>
And plung'd it in the bosom of its lord.<br/>
"Possess," said he, "the fruit of all thy pains,<br/>
And measure, at thy length, our Latian plains.<br/>
Thus are my foes rewarded by my hand;<br/>
Thus may they build their town, and thus enjoy the land!"
</p>
<p>
Then Dares, Butes, Sybaris he slew,<br/>
Whom o'er his neck his flound'ring courser threw.<br/>
As when loud Boreas, with his blust'ring train,<br/>
Stoops from above, incumbent on the main;<br/>
Where'er he flies, he drives the rack before,<br/>
And rolls the billows on th' Aegaean shore:<br/>
So, where resistless Turnus takes his course,<br/>
The scatter'd squadrons bend before his force;<br/>
His crest of horses' hair is blown behind<br/>
By adverse air, and rustles in the wind.
</p>
<p>
This haughty Phegeus saw with high disdain,<br/>
And, as the chariot roll'd along the plain,<br/>
Light from the ground he leapt, and seiz'd the rein.<br/>
Thus hung in air, he still retain'd his hold,<br/>
The coursers frighted, and their course controll'd.<br/>
The lance of Turnus reach'd him as he hung,<br/>
And pierc'd his plated arms, but pass'd along,<br/>
And only raz'd the skin. He turn'd, and held<br/>
Against his threat'ning foe his ample shield;<br/>
Then call'd for aid: but, while he cried in vain,<br/>
The chariot bore him backward on the plain.<br/>
He lies revers'd; the victor king descends,<br/>
And strikes so justly where his helmet ends,<br/>
He lops the head. The Latian fields are drunk<br/>
With streams that issue from the bleeding trunk.
</p>
<p>
While he triumphs, and while the Trojans yield,<br/>
The wounded prince is forc'd to leave the field:<br/>
Strong Mnestheus, and Achates often tried,<br/>
And young Ascanius, weeping by his side,<br/>
Conduct him to his tent. Scarce can he rear<br/>
His limbs from earth, supported on his spear.<br/>
Resolv'd in mind, regardless of the smart,<br/>
He tugs with both his hands, and breaks the dart.<br/>
The steel remains. No readier way he found<br/>
To draw the weapon, than t' inlarge the wound.<br/>
Eager of fight, impatient of delay,<br/>
He begs; and his unwilling friends obey.
</p>
<p>
Iapis was at hand to prove his art,<br/>
Whose blooming youth so fir'd Apollo's heart,<br/>
That, for his love, he proffer'd to bestow<br/>
His tuneful harp and his unerring bow.<br/>
The pious youth, more studious how to save<br/>
His aged sire, now sinking to the grave,<br/>
Preferr'd the pow'r of plants, and silent praise<br/>
Of healing arts, before Phoebean bays.
</p>
<p>
Propp'd on his lance the pensive hero stood,<br/>
And heard and saw, unmov'd, the mourning crowd.<br/>
The fam'd physician tucks his robes around<br/>
With ready hands, and hastens to the wound.<br/>
With gentle touches he performs his part,<br/>
This way and that, soliciting the dart,<br/>
And exercises all his heav'nly art.<br/>
All soft'ning simples, known of sov'reign use,<br/>
He presses out, and pours their noble juice.<br/>
These first infus'd, to lenify the pain,<br/>
He tugs with pincers, but he tugs in vain.<br/>
Then to the patron of his art he pray'd:<br/>
The patron of his art refus'd his aid.
</p>
<p>
Meantime the war approaches to the tents;<br/>
Th' alarm grows hotter, and the noise augments:<br/>
The driving dust proclaims the danger near;<br/>
And first their friends, and then their foes appear:<br/>
Their friends retreat; their foes pursue the rear.<br/>
The camp is fill'd with terror and affright:<br/>
The hissing shafts within the trench alight;<br/>
An undistinguish'd noise ascends the sky,<br/>
The shouts of those who kill, and groans of those who die.
</p>
<p>
But now the goddess mother, mov'd with grief,<br/>
And pierc'd with pity, hastens her relief.<br/>
A branch of healing dittany she brought,<br/>
Which in the Cretan fields with care she sought:<br/>
Rough is the stem, which woolly leafs surround;<br/>
The leafs with flow'rs, the flow'rs with purple crown'd,<br/>
Well known to wounded goats; a sure relief<br/>
To draw the pointed steel, and ease the grief.<br/>
This Venus brings, in clouds involv'd, and brews<br/>
Th' extracted liquor with ambrosian dews,<br/>
And odorous panacee. Unseen she stands,<br/>
Temp'ring the mixture with her heav'nly hands,<br/>
And pours it in a bowl, already crown'd<br/>
With juice of med'c'nal herbs prepar'd to bathe the wound.<br/>
The leech, unknowing of superior art<br/>
Which aids the cure, with this foments the part;<br/>
And in a moment ceas'd the raging smart.<br/>
Stanch'd is the blood, and in the bottom stands:<br/>
The steel, but scarcely touch'd with tender hands,<br/>
Moves up, and follows of its own accord,<br/>
And health and vigour are at once restor'd.<br/>
Iapis first perceiv'd the closing wound,<br/>
And first the footsteps of a god he found.<br/>
"Arms! arms!" he cries; "the sword and shield prepare,<br/>
And send the willing chief, renew'd, to war.<br/>
This is no mortal work, no cure of mine,<br/>
Nor art's effect, but done by hands divine.<br/>
Some god our general to the battle sends;<br/>
Some god preserves his life for greater ends."
</p>
<p>
The hero arms in haste; his hands infold<br/>
His thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold:<br/>
Inflam'd to fight, and rushing to the field,<br/>
That hand sustaining the celestial shield,<br/>
This gripes the lance, and with such vigour shakes,<br/>
That to the rest the beamy weapon quakes.<br/>
Then with a close embrace he strain'd his son,<br/>
And, kissing thro' his helmet, thus begun:<br/>
"My son, from my example learn the war,<br/>
In camps to suffer, and in fields to dare;<br/>
But happier chance than mine attend thy care!<br/>
This day my hand thy tender age shall shield,<br/>
And crown with honours of the conquer'd field:<br/>
Thou, when thy riper years shall send thee forth<br/>
To toils of war, be mindful of my worth;<br/>
Assert thy birthright, and in arms be known,<br/>
For Hector's nephew, and Aeneas' son."<br/>
He said; and, striding, issued on the plain.<br/>
Anteus and Mnestheus, and a num'rous train,<br/>
Attend his steps; the rest their weapons take,<br/>
And, crowding to the field, the camp forsake.<br/>
A cloud of blinding dust is rais'd around,<br/>
Labours beneath their feet the trembling ground.
</p>
<p>
Now Turnus, posted on a hill, from far<br/>
Beheld the progress of the moving war:<br/>
With him the Latins view'd the cover'd plains,<br/>
And the chill blood ran backward in their veins.<br/>
Juturna saw th' advancing troops appear,<br/>
And heard the hostile sound, and fled for fear.<br/>
Aeneas leads; and draws a sweeping train,<br/>
Clos'd in their ranks, and pouring on the plain.<br/>
As when a whirlwind, rushing to the shore<br/>
From the mid ocean, drives the waves before;<br/>
The painful hind with heavy heart foresees<br/>
The flatted fields, and slaughter of the trees;<br/>
With like impetuous rage the prince appears<br/>
Before his doubled front, nor less destruction bears.<br/>
And now both armies shock in open field;<br/>
Osiris is by strong Thymbraeus kill'd.<br/>
Archetius, Ufens, Epulon, are slain<br/>
(All fam'd in arms, and of the Latian train)<br/>
By Gyas', Mnestheus', and Achates' hand.<br/>
The fatal augur falls, by whose command<br/>
The truce was broken, and whose lance, embrued<br/>
With Trojan blood, th' unhappy fight renew'd.<br/>
Loud shouts and clamours rend the liquid sky,<br/>
And o'er the field the frighted Latins fly.<br/>
The prince disdains the dastards to pursue,<br/>
Nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few;<br/>
Turnus alone, amid the dusky plain,<br/>
He seeks, and to the combat calls in vain.<br/>
Juturna heard, and, seiz'd with mortal fear,<br/>
Forc'd from the beam her brother's charioteer;<br/>
Assumes his shape, his armour, and his mien,<br/>
And, like Metiscus, in his seat is seen.
</p>
<p>
As the black swallow near the palace plies;<br/>
O'er empty courts, and under arches, flies;<br/>
Now hawks aloft, now skims along the flood,<br/>
To furnish her loquacious nest with food:<br/>
So drives the rapid goddess o'er the plains;<br/>
The smoking horses run with loosen'd reins.<br/>
She steers a various course among the foes;<br/>
Now here, now there, her conqu'ring brother shows;<br/>
Now with a straight, now with a wheeling flight,<br/>
She turns, and bends, but shuns the single fight.<br/>
Aeneas, fir'd with fury, breaks the crowd,<br/>
And seeks his foe, and calls by name aloud:<br/>
He runs within a narrower ring, and tries<br/>
To stop the chariot; but the chariot flies.<br/>
If he but gain a glimpse, Juturna fears,<br/>
And far away the Daunian hero bears.
</p>
<p>
What should he do! Nor arts nor arms avail;<br/>
And various cares in vain his mind assail.<br/>
The great Messapus, thund'ring thro' the field,<br/>
In his left hand two pointed jav'lins held:<br/>
Encount'ring on the prince, one dart he drew,<br/>
And with unerring aim and utmost vigour threw.<br/>
Aeneas saw it come, and, stooping low<br/>
Beneath his buckler, shunn'd the threat'ning blow.<br/>
The weapon hiss'd above his head, and tore<br/>
The waving plume which on his helm he wore.<br/>
Forced by this hostile act, and fir'd with spite,<br/>
That flying Turnus still declin'd the fight,<br/>
The Prince, whose piety had long repell'd<br/>
His inborn ardour, now invades the field;<br/>
Invokes the pow'rs of violated peace,<br/>
Their rites and injur'd altars to redress;<br/>
Then, to his rage abandoning the rein,<br/>
With blood and slaughter'd bodies fills the plain.
</p>
<p>
What god can tell, what numbers can display,<br/>
The various labours of that fatal day;<br/>
What chiefs and champions fell on either side,<br/>
In combat slain, or by what deaths they died;<br/>
Whom Turnus, whom the Trojan hero kill'd;<br/>
Who shar'd the fame and fortune of the field!<br/>
Jove, could'st thou view, and not avert thy sight,<br/>
Two jarring nations join'd in cruel fight,<br/>
Whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite!
</p>
<p>
Aeneas first Rutulian Sucro found,<br/>
Whose valour made the Trojans quit their ground;<br/>
Betwixt his ribs the jav'lin drove so just,<br/>
It reach'd his heart, nor needs a second thrust.<br/>
Now Turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew;<br/>
First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw:<br/>
Then, leaping on the ground, on foot assail'd<br/>
Diores, and in equal fight prevail'd.<br/>
Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place;<br/>
Their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace.
</p>
<p>
Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw,<br/>
Whom without respite at one charge he slew:<br/>
Cethegus, Tanais, Tagus, fell oppress'd,<br/>
And sad Onythes, added to the rest,<br/>
Of Theban blood, whom Peridia bore.
</p>
<p>
Turnus two brothers from the Lycian shore,<br/>
And from Apollo's fane to battle sent,<br/>
O'erthrew; nor Phoebus could their fate prevent.<br/>
Peaceful Menoetes after these he kill'd,<br/>
Who long had shunn'd the dangers of the field:<br/>
On Lerna's lake a silent life he led,<br/>
And with his nets and angle earn'd his bread;<br/>
Nor pompous cares, nor palaces, he knew,<br/>
But wisely from th' infectious world withdrew:<br/>
Poor was his house; his father's painful hand<br/>
Discharg'd his rent, and plow'd another's land.
</p>
<p>
As flames among the lofty woods are thrown<br/>
On diff'rent sides, and both by winds are blown;<br/>
The laurels crackle in the sputt'ring fire;<br/>
The frighted sylvans from their shades retire:<br/>
Or as two neighb'ring torrents fall from high;<br/>
Rapid they run; the foamy waters fry;<br/>
They roll to sea with unresisted force,<br/>
And down the rocks precipitate their course:<br/>
Not with less rage the rival heroes take<br/>
Their diff'rent ways, nor less destruction make.<br/>
With spears afar, with swords at hand, they strike;<br/>
And zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike.<br/>
Like them, their dauntless men maintain the field;<br/>
And hearts are pierc'd, unknowing how to yield:<br/>
They blow for blow return, and wound for wound;<br/>
And heaps of bodies raise the level ground.
</p>
<p>
Murranus, boasting of his blood, that springs<br/>
From a long royal race of Latian kings,<br/>
Is by the Trojan from his chariot thrown,<br/>
Crush'd with the weight of an unwieldy stone:<br/>
Betwixt the wheels he fell; the wheels, that bore<br/>
His living load, his dying body tore.<br/>
His starting steeds, to shun the glitt'ring sword,<br/>
Paw down his trampled limbs, forgetful of their lord.
</p>
<p>
Fierce Hyllus threaten'd high, and, face to face,<br/>
Affronted Turnus in the middle space:<br/>
The prince encounter'd him in full career,<br/>
And at his temples aim'd the deadly spear;<br/>
So fatally the flying weapon sped,<br/>
That thro' his brazen helm it pierc'd his head.<br/>
Nor, Cisseus, couldst thou scape from Turnus' hand,<br/>
In vain the strongest of th' Arcadian band:<br/>
Nor to Cupentus could his gods afford<br/>
Availing aid against th' Aenean sword,<br/>
Which to his naked heart pursued the course;<br/>
Nor could his plated shield sustain the force.
</p>
<p>
Iolas fell, whom not the Grecian pow'rs,<br/>
Nor great subverter of the Trojan tow'rs,<br/>
Were doom'd to kill, while Heav'n prolong'd his date;<br/>
But who can pass the bounds, prefix'd by fate?<br/>
In high Lyrnessus, and in Troy, he held<br/>
Two palaces, and was from each expell'd:<br/>
Of all the mighty man, the last remains<br/>
A little spot of foreign earth contains.
</p>
<p>
And now both hosts their broken troops unite<br/>
In equal ranks, and mix in mortal fight.<br/>
Seresthus and undaunted Mnestheus join<br/>
The Trojan, Tuscan, and Arcadian line:<br/>
Sea-born Messapus, with Atinas, heads<br/>
The Latin squadrons, and to battle leads.<br/>
They strike, they push, they throng the scanty space,<br/>
Resolv'd on death, impatient of disgrace;<br/>
And, where one falls, another fills his place.
</p>
<p>
The Cyprian goddess now inspires her son<br/>
To leave th' unfinish'd fight, and storm the town:<br/>
For, while he rolls his eyes around the plain<br/>
In quest of Turnus, whom he seeks in vain,<br/>
He views th' unguarded city from afar,<br/>
In careless quiet, and secure of war.<br/>
Occasion offers, and excites his mind<br/>
To dare beyond the task he first design'd.<br/>
Resolv'd, he calls his chiefs; they leave the fight:<br/>
Attended thus, he takes a neighb'ring height;<br/>
The crowding troops about their gen'ral stand,<br/>
All under arms, and wait his high command.<br/>
Then thus the lofty prince: "Hear and obey,<br/>
Ye Trojan bands, without the least delay<br/>
Jove is with us; and what I have decreed<br/>
Requires our utmost vigour, and our speed.<br/>
Your instant arms against the town prepare,<br/>
The source of mischief, and the seat of war.<br/>
This day the Latian tow'rs, that mate the sky,<br/>
Shall level with the plain in ashes lie:<br/>
The people shall be slaves, unless in time<br/>
They kneel for pardon, and repent their crime.<br/>
Twice have our foes been vanquish'd on the plain:<br/>
Then shall I wait till Turnus will be slain?<br/>
Your force against the perjur'd city bend.<br/>
There it began, and there the war shall end.<br/>
The peace profan'd our rightful arms requires;<br/>
Cleanse the polluted place with purging fires."
</p>
<p>
He finish'd; and, one soul inspiring all,<br/>
Form'd in a wedge, the foot approach the wall.<br/>
Without the town, an unprovided train<br/>
Of gaping, gazing citizens are slain.<br/>
Some firebrands, others scaling ladders bear,<br/>
And those they toss aloft, and these they rear:<br/>
The flames now launch'd, the feather'd arrows fly,<br/>
And clouds of missive arms obscure the sky.<br/>
Advancing to the front, the hero stands,<br/>
And, stretching out to heav'n his pious hands,<br/>
Attests the gods, asserts his innocence,<br/>
Upbraids with breach of faith th' Ausonian prince;<br/>
Declares the royal honour doubly stain'd,<br/>
And twice the rites of holy peace profan'd.
</p>
<p>
Dissenting clamours in the town arise;<br/>
Each will be heard, and all at once advise.<br/>
One part for peace, and one for war contends;<br/>
Some would exclude their foes, and some admit their friends.<br/>
The helpless king is hurried in the throng,<br/>
And, whate'er tide prevails, is borne along.<br/>
Thus, when the swain, within a hollow rock,<br/>
Invades the bees with suffocating smoke,<br/>
They run around, or labour on their wings,<br/>
Disus'd to flight, and shoot their sleepy stings;<br/>
To shun the bitter fumes in vain they try;<br/>
Black vapours, issuing from the vent, involve the sky.
</p>
<p
>But fate and envious fortune now prepare<br/>
To plunge the Latins in the last despair.<br/>
The queen, who saw the foes invade the town,<br/>
And brands on tops of burning houses thrown,<br/>
Cast round her eyes, distracted with her fearâ€”<br/>
No troops of Turnus in the field appear.<br/>
Once more she stares abroad, but still in vain,<br/>
And then concludes the royal youth is slain.<br/>
Mad with her anguish, impotent to bear<br/>
The mighty grief, she loathes the vital air.<br/>
She calls herself the cause of all this ill,<br/>
And owns the dire effects of her ungovern'd will;<br/>
She raves against the gods; she beats her breast;<br/>
She tears with both her hands her purple vest:<br/>
Then round a beam a running noose she tied,<br/>
And, fasten'd by the neck, obscenely died.
</p>
<p>
Soon as the fatal news by Fame was blown,<br/>
And to her dames and to her daughter known,<br/>
The sad Lavinia rends her yellow hair<br/>
And rosy cheeks; the rest her sorrow share:<br/>
With shrieks the palace rings, and madness of despair.<br/>
The spreading rumour fills the public place:<br/>
Confusion, fear, distraction, and disgrace,<br/>
And silent shame, are seen in ev'ry face.<br/>
Latinus tears his garments as he goes,<br/>
Both for his public and his private woes;<br/>
With filth his venerable beard besmears,<br/>
And sordid dust deforms his silver hairs.<br/>
And much he blames the softness of his mind,<br/>
Obnoxious to the charms of womankind,<br/>
And soon seduc'd to change what he so well design'd;<br/>
To break the solemn league so long desir'd,<br/>
Nor finish what his fates, and those of Troy, requir'd.
</p>
<p>
Now Turnus rolls aloof o'er empty plains,<br/>
And here and there some straggling foes he gleans.<br/>
His flying coursers please him less and less,<br/>
Asham'd of easy fight and cheap success.<br/>
Thus half-contented, anxious in his mind,<br/>
The distant cries come driving in the wind,<br/>
Shouts from the walls, but shouts in murmurs drown'd;<br/>
A jarring mixture, and a boding sound.<br/>
"Alas!" said he, "what mean these dismal cries?<br/>
What doleful clamours from the town arise?"<br/>
Confus'd, he stops, and backward pulls the reins.<br/>
She who the driver's office now sustains,<br/>
Replies: "Neglect, my lord, these new alarms;<br/>
Here fight, and urge the fortune of your arms:<br/>
There want not others to defend the wall.<br/>
If by your rival's hand th' Italians fall,<br/>
So shall your fatal sword his friends oppress,<br/>
In honour equal, equal in success."
</p>
<p>
To this, the prince: "O sisterâ€”for I knew<br/>
The peace infring'd proceeded first from you;<br/>
I knew you, when you mingled first in fight;<br/>
And now in vain you would deceive my sightâ€”<br/>
Why, goddess, this unprofitable care?<br/>
Who sent you down from heav'n, involv'd in air,<br/>
Your share of mortal sorrows to sustain,<br/>
And see your brother bleeding on the plain?<br/>
For to what pow'r can Turnus have recourse,<br/>
Or how resist his fate's prevailing force?<br/>
These eyes beheld Murranus bite the ground:<br/>
Mighty the man, and mighty was the wound.<br/>
I heard my dearest friend, with dying breath,<br/>
My name invoking to revenge his death.<br/>
Brave Ufens fell with honour on the place,<br/>
To shun the shameful sight of my disgrace.<br/>
On earth supine, a manly corpse he lies;<br/>
His vest and armour are the victor's prize.<br/>
Then, shall I see Laurentum in a flame,<br/>
Which only wanted, to complete my shame?<br/>
How will the Latins hoot their champion's flight!<br/>
How Drances will insult and point them to the sight!<br/>
Is death so hard to bear? Ye gods below,<br/>
(Since those above so small compassion show,)<br/>
Receive a soul unsullied yet with shame,<br/>
Which not belies my great forefather's name!"
</p>
<p>
He said; and while he spoke, with flying speed<br/>
Came Sages urging on his foamy steed:<br/>
Fix'd on his wounded face a shaft he bore,<br/>
And, seeking Turnus, sent his voice before:<br/>
"Turnus, on you, on you alone, depends<br/>
Our last relief: compassionate your friends!<br/>
Like lightning, fierce Aeneas, rolling on,<br/>
With arms invests, with flames invades the town:<br/>
The brands are toss'd on high; the winds conspire<br/>
To drive along the deluge of the fire.<br/>
All eyes are fix'd on you: your foes rejoice;<br/>
Ev'n the king staggers, and suspends his choice;<br/>
Doubts to deliver or defend the town,<br/>
Whom to reject, or whom to call his son.<br/>
The queen, on whom your utmost hopes were plac'd,<br/>
Herself suborning death, has breath'd her last.<br/>
'Tis true, Messapus, fearless of his fate,<br/>
With fierce Atinas' aid, defends the gate:<br/>
On ev'ry side surrounded by the foe,<br/>
The more they kill, the greater numbers grow;<br/>
An iron harvest mounts, and still remains to mow.<br/>
You, far aloof from your forsaken bands,<br/>
Your rolling chariot drive o'er empty sands."
</p>
<p>
Stupid he sate, his eyes on earth declin'd,<br/>
And various cares revolving in his mind:<br/>
Rage, boiling from the bottom of his breast,<br/>
And sorrow mix'd with shame, his soul oppress'd;<br/>
And conscious worth lay lab'ring in his thought,<br/>
And love by jealousy to madness wrought.<br/>
By slow degrees his reason drove away<br/>
The mists of passion, and resum'd her sway.<br/>
Then, rising on his car, he turn'd his look,<br/>
And saw the town involv'd in fire and smoke.<br/>
A wooden tow'r with flames already blaz'd,<br/>
Which his own hands on beams and rafters rais'd;<br/>
And bridges laid above to join the space,<br/>
And wheels below to roll from place to place.<br/>
"Sister, the Fates have vanquish'd: let us go<br/>
The way which Heav'n and my hard fortune show.<br/>
The fight is fix'd; nor shall the branded name<br/>
Of a base coward blot your brother's fame.<br/>
Death is my choice; but suffer me to try<br/>
My force, and vent my rage before I die."<br/>
He said; and, leaping down without delay,<br/>
Thro' crowds of scatter'd foes he freed his way.<br/>
Striding he pass'd, impetuous as the wind,<br/>
And left the grieving goddess far behind.<br/>
As when a fragment, from a mountain torn<br/>
By raging tempests, or by torrents borne,<br/>
Or sapp'd by time, or loosen'd from the rootsâ€”<br/>
Prone thro' the void the rocky ruin shoots,<br/>
Rolling from crag to crag, from steep to steep;<br/>
Down sink, at once, the shepherds and their sheep:<br/>
Involv'd alike, they rush to nether ground;<br/>
Stunn'd with the shock they fall, and stunn'd from earth rebound:<br/>
So Turnus, hasting headlong to the town,<br/>
Should'ring and shoving, bore the squadrons down.<br/>
Still pressing onward, to the walls he drew,<br/>
Where shafts, and spears, and darts promiscuous flew,<br/>
And sanguine streams the slipp'ry ground embrue.<br/>
First stretching out his arm, in sign of peace,<br/>
He cries aloud, to make the combat cease:<br/>
"Rutulians, hold; and Latin troops, retire!<br/>
The fight is mine; and me the gods require.<br/>
'Tis just that I should vindicate alone<br/>
The broken truce, or for the breach atone.<br/>
This day shall free from wars th' Ausonian state,<br/>
Or finish my misfortunes in my fate."
</p>
<p>
Both armies from their bloody work desist,<br/>
And, bearing backward, form a spacious list.<br/>
The Trojan hero, who receiv'd from fame<br/>
The welcome sound, and heard the champion's name,<br/>
Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls,<br/>
Greedy of war where greater glory calls.<br/>
He springs to fight, exulting in his force;<br/>
His jointed armour rattles in the course.<br/>
Like Eryx, or like Athos, great he shows,<br/>
Or Father Apennine, when, white with snows,<br/>
His head divine obscure in clouds he hides,<br/>
And shakes the sounding forest on his sides.<br/>
The nations, overaw'd, surcease the fight;<br/>
Immovable their bodies, fix'd their sight.<br/>
Ev'n death stands still; nor from above they throw<br/>
Their darts, nor drive their batt'ring-rams below.<br/>
In silent order either army stands,<br/>
And drop their swords, unknowing, from their hands.<br/>
Th' Ausonian king beholds, with wond'ring sight,<br/>
Two mighty champions match'd in single fight,<br/>
Born under climes remote, and brought by fate,<br/>
With swords to try their titles to the state.
</p>
<p>
Now, in clos'd field, each other from afar<br/>
They view; and, rushing on, begin the war.<br/>
They launch their spears; then hand to hand they meet;<br/>
The trembling soil resounds beneath their feet:<br/>
Their bucklers clash; thick blows descend from high,<br/>
And flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly.<br/>
Courage conspires with chance, and both engage<br/>
With equal fortune yet, and mutual rage.<br/>
As when two bulls for their fair female fight<br/>
In Sila's shades, or on Taburnus' height;<br/>
With horns adverse they meet; the keeper flies;<br/>
Mute stands the herd; the heifers roll their eyes,<br/>
And wait th' event; which victor they shall bear,<br/>
And who shall be the lord, to rule the lusty year:<br/>
With rage of love the jealous rivals burn,<br/>
And push for push, and wound for wound return;<br/>
Their dewlaps gor'd, their sides are lav'd in blood;<br/>
Loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow thro' the wood:<br/>
Such was the combat in the listed ground;<br/>
So clash their swords, and so their shields resound.
</p>
<p>
Jove sets the beam; in either scale he lays<br/>
The champions' fate, and each exactly weighs.<br/>
On this side, life and lucky chance ascends;<br/>
Loaded with death, that other scale descends.<br/>
Rais'd on the stretch, young Turnus aims a blow<br/>
Full on the helm of his unguarded foe:<br/>
Shrill shouts and clamours ring on either side,<br/>
As hopes and fears their panting hearts divide.<br/>
But all in pieces flies the traitor sword,<br/>
And, in the middle stroke, deserts his lord.<br/>
Now is but death, or flight; disarm'd he flies,<br/>
When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies.<br/>
Fame says that Turnus, when his steeds he join'd,<br/>
Hurrying to war, disorder'd in his mind,<br/>
Snatch'd the first weapon which his haste could find.<br/>
'Twas not the fated sword his father bore,<br/>
But that his charioteer Metiscus wore.<br/>
This, while the Trojans fled, the toughness held;<br/>
But, vain against the great Vulcanian shield,<br/>
The mortal-temper'd steel deceiv'd his hand:<br/>
The shiver'd fragments shone amid the sand.
</p>
<p>
Surpris'd with fear, he fled along the field,<br/>
And now forthright, and now in orbits wheel'd;<br/>
For here the Trojan troops the list surround,<br/>
And there the pass is clos'd with pools and marshy ground.<br/>
Aeneas hastens, tho' with heavier paceâ€”<br/>
His wound, so newly knit, retards the chase,<br/>
And oft his trembling knees their aid refuseâ€”<br/>
Yet, pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues.
</p>
<p>
Thus, when a fearful stag is clos'd around<br/>
With crimson toils, or in a river found,<br/>
High on the bank the deep-mouth'd hound appears,<br/>
Still opening, following still, where'er he steers;<br/>
The persecuted creature, to and fro,<br/>
Turns here and there, to scape his Umbrian foe:<br/>
Steep is th' ascent, and, if he gains the land,<br/>
The purple death is pitch'd along the strand.<br/>
His eager foe, determin'd to the chase,<br/>
Stretch'd at his length, gains ground at ev'ry pace;<br/>
Now to his beamy head he makes his way,<br/>
And now he holds, or thinks he holds, his prey:<br/>
Just at the pinch, the stag springs out with fear;<br/>
He bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with air:<br/>
The rocks, the lakes, the meadows ring with cries;<br/>
The mortal tumult mounts, and thunders in the skies.<br/>
Thus flies the Daunian prince, and, flying, blames<br/>
His tardy troops, and, calling by their names,<br/>
Demands his trusty sword. The Trojan threats<br/>
The realm with ruin, and their ancient seats<br/>
To lay in ashes, if they dare supply<br/>
With arms or aid his vanquish'd enemy:<br/>
Thus menacing, he still pursues the course,<br/>
With vigour, tho' diminish'd of his force.<br/>
Ten times already round the listed place<br/>
One chief had fled, and t' other giv'n the chase:<br/>
No trivial prize is play'd; for on the life<br/>
Or death of Turnus now depends the strife.
</p>
<p>
Within the space, an olive tree had stood,<br/>
A sacred shade, a venerable wood,<br/>
For vows to Faunus paid, the Latins' guardian god.<br/>
Here hung the vests, and tablets were engrav'd,<br/>
Of sinking mariners from shipwreck sav'd.<br/>
With heedless hands the Trojans fell'd the tree,<br/>
To make the ground enclos'd for combat free.<br/>
Deep in the root, whether by fate, or chance,<br/>
Or erring haste, the Trojan drove his lance;<br/>
Then stoop'd, and tugg'd with force immense, to free<br/>
Th' incumber'd spear from the tenacious tree;<br/>
That, whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain,<br/>
His flying weapon might from far attain.
</p>
<p>
Confus'd with fear, bereft of human aid,<br/>
Then Turnus to the gods, and first to Faunus pray'd:<br/>
"O Faunus, pity! and thou Mother Earth,<br/>
Where I thy foster son receiv'd my birth,<br/>
Hold fast the steel! If my religious hand<br/>
Your plant has honour'd, which your foes profan'd,<br/>
Propitious hear my pious pray'r!" He said,<br/>
Nor with successless vows invok'd their aid.<br/>
Th' incumbent hero wrench'd, and pull'd, and strain'd;<br/>
But still the stubborn earth the steel detain'd.<br/>
Juturna took her time; and, while in vain<br/>
He strove, assum'd Meticus' form again,<br/>
And, in that imitated shape, restor'd<br/>
To the despairing prince his Daunian sword.<br/>
The Queen of Love, who, with disdain and grief,<br/>
Saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief,<br/>
T' assert her offspring with a greater deed,<br/>
From the tough root the ling'ring weapon freed.
</p>
<p>
Once more erect, the rival chiefs advance:<br/>
One trusts the sword, and one the pointed lance;<br/>
And both resolv'd alike to try their fatal chance.
</p>
<p>
Meantime imperial Jove to Juno spoke,<br/>
Who from a shining cloud beheld the shock:<br/>
"What new arrest, O Queen of Heav'n, is sent<br/>
To stop the Fates now lab'ring in th' event?<br/>
What farther hopes are left thee to pursue?<br/>
Divine Aeneas, (and thou know'st it too,)<br/>
Foredoom'd, to these celestial seats are due.<br/>
What more attempts for Turnus can be made,<br/>
That thus thou ling'rest in this lonely shade?<br/>
Is it becoming of the due respect<br/>
And awful honour of a god elect,<br/>
A wound unworthy of our state to feel,<br/>
Patient of human hands and earthly steel?<br/>
Or seems it just, the sister should restore<br/>
A second sword, when one was lost before,<br/>
And arm a conquer'd wretch against his conqueror?<br/>
For what, without thy knowledge and avow,<br/>
Nay more, thy dictate, durst Juturna do?<br/>
At last, in deference to my love, forbear<br/>
To lodge within thy soul this anxious care;<br/>
Reclin'd upon my breast, thy grief unload:<br/>
Who should relieve the goddess, but the god?<br/>
Now all things to their utmost issue tend,<br/>
Push'd by the Fates to their appointed end.<br/>
While leave was giv'n thee, and a lawful hour<br/>
For vengeance, wrath, and unresisted pow'r,<br/>
Toss'd on the seas, thou couldst thy foes distress,<br/>
And, driv'n ashore, with hostile arms oppress;<br/>
Deform the royal house; and, from the side<br/>
Of the just bridegroom, tear the plighted bride:<br/>
Now cease at my command." The Thund'rer said;<br/>
And, with dejected eyes, this answer Juno made:<br/>
"Because your dread decree too well I knew,<br/>
From Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew.<br/>
Else should you not behold me here, alone,<br/>
Involv'd in empty clouds, my friends bemoan,<br/>
But, girt with vengeful flames, in open sight<br/>
Engag'd against my foes in mortal fight.<br/>
'Tis true, Juturna mingled in the strife<br/>
By my command, to save her brother's life,<br/>
At least to try; but, by the Stygian lake,<br/>
(The most religious oath the gods can take,)<br/>
With this restriction, not to bend the bow,<br/>
Or toss the spear, or trembling dart to throw.<br/>
And now, resign'd to your superior might,<br/>
And tir'd with fruitless toils, I loathe the fight.<br/>
This let me beg (and this no fates withstand)<br/>
Both for myself and for your father's land,<br/>
That, when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace,<br/>
(Which I, since you ordain, consent to bless,)<br/>
The laws of either nation be the same;<br/>
But let the Latins still retain their name,<br/>
Speak the same language which they spoke before,<br/>
Wear the same habits which their grandsires wore.<br/>
Call them not Trojans: perish the renown<br/>
And name of Troy, with that detested town.<br/>
Latium be Latium still; let Alba reign<br/>
And Rome's immortal majesty remain."
</p>
<p>
Then thus the founder of mankind replies<br/>
(Unruffled was his front, serene his eyes)<br/>
"Can Saturn's issue, and heav'n's other heir,<br/>
Such endless anger in her bosom bear?<br/>
Be mistress, and your full desires obtain;<br/>
But quench the choler you foment in vain.<br/>
From ancient blood th' Ausonian people sprung,<br/>
Shall keep their name, their habit, and their tongue.<br/>
The Trojans to their customs shall be tied:<br/>
I will, myself, their common rites provide;<br/>
The natives shall command, the foreigners subside.<br/>
All shall be Latium; Troy without a name;<br/>
And her lost sons forget from whence they came.<br/>
From blood so mix'd, a pious race shall flow,<br/>
Equal to gods, excelling all below.<br/>
No nation more respect to you shall pay,<br/>
Or greater off'rings on your altars lay."<br/>
Juno consents, well pleas'd that her desires<br/>
Had found success, and from the cloud retires.
</p>
<p>
The peace thus made, the Thund'rer next prepares<br/>
To force the wat'ry goddess from the wars.<br/>
Deep in the dismal regions void of light,<br/>
Three daughters at a birth were born to Night:<br/>
These their brown mother, brooding on her care,<br/>
Indued with windy wings to flit in air,<br/>
With serpents girt alike, and crown'd with hissing hair.<br/>
In heav'n the Dirae call'd, and still at hand,<br/>
Before the throne of angry Jove they stand,<br/>
His ministers of wrath, and ready still<br/>
The minds of mortal men with fears to fill,<br/>
Whene'er the moody sire, to wreak his hate<br/>
On realms or towns deserving of their fate,<br/>
Hurls down diseases, death and deadly care,<br/>
And terrifies the guilty world with war.<br/>
One sister plague if these from heav'n he sent,<br/>
To fright Juturna with a dire portent.<br/>
The pest comes whirling down: by far more slow<br/>
Springs the swift arrow from the Parthian bow,<br/>
Or Cydon yew, when, traversing the skies,<br/>
And drench'd in pois'nous juice, the sure destruction flies.<br/>
With such a sudden and unseen a flight<br/>
Shot thro' the clouds the daughter of the night.<br/>
Soon as the field inclos'd she had in view,<br/>
And from afar her destin'd quarry knew,<br/>
Contracted, to the boding bird she turns,<br/>
Which haunts the ruin'd piles and hallow'd urns,<br/>
And beats about the tombs with nightly wings,<br/>
Where songs obscene on sepulchers she sings.<br/>
Thus lessen'd in her form, with frightful cries<br/>
The Fury round unhappy Turnus flies,<br/>
Flaps on his shield, and flutters o'er his eyes.
</p>
<p>
A lazy chillness crept along his blood;<br/>
Chok'd was his voice; his hair with horror stood.<br/>
Juturna from afar beheld her fly,<br/>
And knew th' ill omen, by her screaming cry<br/>
And stridor of her wings. Amaz'd with fear,<br/>
Her beauteous breast she beat, and rent her flowing hair.
</p>
<p>
"Ah me!" she cries, "in this unequal strife<br/>
What can thy sister more to save thy life?<br/>
Weak as I am, can I, alas! contend<br/>
In arms with that inexorable fiend?<br/>
Now, now, I quit the field! forbear to fright<br/>
My tender soul, ye baleful birds of night;<br/>
The lashing of your wings I know too well,<br/>
The sounding flight, and fun'ral screams of hell!<br/>
These are the gifts you bring from haughty Jove,<br/>
The worthy recompense of ravish'd love!<br/>
Did he for this exempt my life from fate?<br/>
O hard conditions of immortal state,<br/>
Tho' born to death, not privileg'd to die,<br/>
But forc'd to bear impos'd eternity!<br/>
Take back your envious bribes, and let me go<br/>
Companion to my brother's ghost below!<br/>
The joys are vanish'd: nothing now remains,<br/>
Of life immortal, but immortal pains.<br/>
What earth will open her devouring womb,<br/>
To rest a weary goddess in the tomb!"<br/>
She drew a length of sighs; nor more she said,<br/>
But in her azure mantle wrapp'd her head,<br/>
Then plung'd into her stream, with deep despair,<br/>
And her last sobs came bubbling up in air.
</p>
<p>
Now stern Aeneas waves his weighty spear<br/>
Against his foe, and thus upbraids his fear:<br/>
"What farther subterfuge can Turnus find?<br/>
What empty hopes are harbour'd in his mind?<br/>
'Tis not thy swiftness can secure thy flight;<br/>
Not with their feet, but hands, the valiant fight.<br/>
Vary thy shape in thousand forms, and dare<br/>
What skill and courage can attempt in war;<br/>
Wish for the wings of winds, to mount the sky;<br/>
Or hid, within the hollow earth to lie!"<br/>
The champion shook his head, and made this short reply:<br/>
"No threats of thine my manly mind can move;<br/>
'Tis hostile heav'n I dread, and partial Jove."<br/>
He said no more, but, with a sigh, repress'd<br/>
The mighty sorrow in his swelling breast.
</p>
<p>
Then, as he roll'd his troubled eyes around,<br/>
An antique stone he saw, the common bound<br/>
Of neighb'ring fields, and barrier of the ground;<br/>
So vast, that twelve strong men of modern days<br/>
Th' enormous weight from earth could hardly raise.<br/>
He heav'd it at a lift, and, pois'd on high,<br/>
Ran stagg'ring on against his enemy,<br/>
But so disorder'd, that he scarcely knew<br/>
His way, or what unwieldly weight he threw.<br/>
His knocking knees are bent beneath the load,<br/>
And shiv'ring cold congeals his vital blood.<br/>
The stone drops from his arms, and, falling short<br/>
For want of vigour, mocks his vain effort.<br/>
And as, when heavy sleep has clos'd the sight,<br/>
The sickly fancy labours in the night;<br/>
We seem to run; and, destitute of force,<br/>
Our sinking limbs forsake us in the course:<br/>
In vain we heave for breath; in vain we cry;<br/>
The nerves, unbrac'd, their usual strength deny;<br/>
And on the tongue the falt'ring accents die:<br/>
So Turnus far'd; whatever means he tried,<br/>
All force of arms and points of art employ'd,<br/>
The Fury flew athwart, and made th' endeavor void.
</p>
<p>A thousand various thoughts his soul confound;<br/>
He star'd about, nor aid nor issue found;<br/>
His own men stop the pass, and his own walls surround.<br/>
Once more he pauses, and looks out again,<br/>
And seeks the goddess charioteer in vain.<br/>
Trembling he views the thund'ring chief advance,<br/>
And brandishing aloft the deadly lance:<br/>
Amaz'd he cow'rs beneath his conqu'ring foe,<br/>
Forgets to ward, and waits the coming blow.<br/>
Astonish'd while he stands, and fix'd with fear,<br/>
Aim'd at his shield he sees th' impending spear.
</p>
<p>
The hero measur'd first, with narrow view,<br/>
The destin'd mark; and, rising as he threw,<br/>
With its full swing the fatal weapon flew.<br/>
Not with less rage the rattling thunder falls,<br/>
Or stones from batt'ring-engines break the walls:<br/>
Swift as a whirlwind, from an arm so strong,<br/>
The lance drove on, and bore the death along.<br/>
Naught could his sev'nfold shield the prince avail,<br/>
Nor aught, beneath his arms, the coat of mail:<br/>
It pierc'd thro' all, and with a grisly wound<br/>
Transfix'd his thigh, and doubled him to ground.<br/>
With groans the Latins rend the vaulted sky:<br/>
Woods, hills, and valleys, to the voice reply.
</p>
<p>
Now low on earth the lofty chief is laid,<br/>
With eyes cast upward, and with arms display'd,<br/>
And, recreant, thus to the proud victor pray'd:<br/>
"I know my death deserv'd, nor hope to live:<br/>
Use what the gods and thy good fortune give.<br/>
Yet think, O think, if mercy may be shown,<br/>
Thou hadst a father once, and hast a son.<br/>
Pity my sire, now sinking to the grave;<br/>
And for Anchises' sake old Daunus save!<br/>
Or, if thy vow'd revenge pursue my death,<br/>
Give to my friends my body void of breath!<br/>
The Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life;<br/>
Thine is the conquest, thine the royal wife:<br/>
Against a yielded man, 'tis mean ignoble strife."
</p>
<p>
In deep suspense the Trojan seem'd to stand,<br/>
And, just prepar'd to strike, repress'd his hand.<br/>
He roll'd his eyes, and ev'ry moment felt<br/>
His manly soul with more compassion melt;<br/>
When, casting down a casual glance, he spied<br/>
The golden belt that glitter'd on his side,<br/>
The fatal spoils which haughty Turnus tore<br/>
From dying Pallas, and in triumph wore.<br/>
Then, rous'd anew to wrath, he loudly cries<br/>
(Flames, while he spoke, came flashing from his eyes)<br/>
"Traitor, dost thou, dost thou to grace pretend,<br/>
Clad, as thou art, in trophies of my friend?<br/>
To his sad soul a grateful off'ring go!<br/>
'Tis Pallas, Pallas gives this deadly blow."<br/>
He rais'd his arm aloft, and, at the word,<br/>
Deep in his bosom drove the shining sword.<br/>
The streaming blood distain'd his arms around;<br/>
And the disdainful soul came rushing through the wound.
</p>

<h1>Aeneid</h1>
<h2>by Virgil</h2>
<h3>Book VIII</h3>
<p>
When Turnus had assembled all his pow'rs,<br/>
His standard planted on Laurentum's tow'rs;<br/>
When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar,<br/>
Had giv'n the signal of approaching war,<br/>
Had rous'd the neighing steeds to scour the fields,<br/>
While the fierce riders clatter'd on their shields;<br/>
Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare<br/>
To join th' allies, and headlong rush to war.<br/>
Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd,<br/>
With bold Mezentius, who blasphem'd aloud.<br/>
These thro' the country took their wasteful course,<br/>
The fields to forage, and to gather force.<br/>
Then Venulus to Diomede they send,<br/>
To beg his aid Ausonia to defend,<br/>
Declare the common danger, and inform<br/>
The Grecian leader of the growing storm:<br/>
"Aeneas, landed on the Latian coast,<br/>
With banish'd gods, and with a baffled host,<br/>
Yet now aspir'd to conquest of the state,<br/>
And claim'd a title from the gods and fate;<br/>
What num'rous nations in his quarrel came,<br/>
And how they spread his formidable name.<br/>
What he design'd, what mischief might arise,<br/>
If fortune favour'd his first enterprise,<br/>
Was left for him to weigh, whose equal fears,<br/>
And common interest, was involv'd in theirs."
</p>
<p>
While Turnus and th' allies thus urge the war,<br/>
The Trojan, floating in a flood of care,<br/>
Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare.<br/>
This way and that he turns his anxious mind;<br/>
Thinks, and rejects the counsels he design'd;<br/>
Explores himself in vain, in ev'ry part,<br/>
And gives no rest to his distracted heart.<br/>
So, when the sun by day, or moon by night,<br/>
Strike on the polish'd brass their trembling light,<br/>
The glitt'ring species here and there divide,<br/>
And cast their dubious beams from side to side;<br/>
Now on the walls, now on the pavement play,<br/>
And to the ceiling flash the glaring day.
</p>
<p>
'Twas night; and weary nature lull'd asleep<br/>
The birds of air, and fishes of the deep,<br/>
And beasts, and mortal men. The Trojan chief<br/>
Was laid on Tiber's banks, oppress'd with grief,<br/>
And found in silent slumber late relief.<br/>
Then, thro' the shadows of the poplar wood,<br/>
Arose the father of the Roman flood;<br/>
An azure robe was o'er his body spread,<br/>
A wreath of shady reeds adorn'd his head:<br/>
Thus, manifest to sight, the god appear'd,<br/>
And with these pleasing words his sorrow cheer'd:<br/>
"Undoubted offspring of ethereal race,<br/>
O long expected in this promis'd place!<br/>
Who thro' the foes hast borne thy banish'd gods,<br/>
Restor'd them to their hearths, and old abodes;<br/>
This is thy happy home, the clime where fate<br/>
Ordains thee to restore the Trojan state.<br/>
Fear not! The war shall end in lasting peace,<br/>
And all the rage of haughty Juno cease.<br/>
And that this nightly vision may not seem<br/>
Th' effect of fancy, or an idle dream,<br/>
A sow beneath an oak shall lie along,<br/>
All white herself, and white her thirty young.<br/>
When thirty rolling years have run their race,<br/>
Thy son Ascanius, on this empty space,<br/>
Shall build a royal town, of lasting fame,<br/>
Which from this omen shall receive the name.<br/>
Time shall approve the truth. For what remains,<br/>
And how with sure success to crown thy pains,<br/>
With patience next attend. A banish'd band,<br/>
Driv'n with Evander from th' Arcadian land,<br/>
Have planted here, and plac'd on high their walls;<br/>
Their town the founder Pallanteum calls,<br/>
Deriv'd from Pallas, his great-grandsire's name:<br/>
But the fierce Latians old possession claim,<br/>
With war infesting the new colony.<br/>
These make thy friends, and on their aid rely.<br/>
To thy free passage I submit my streams.<br/>
Wake, son of Venus, from thy pleasing dreams;<br/>
And, when the setting stars are lost in day,<br/>
To Juno's pow'r thy just devotion pay;<br/>
With sacrifice the wrathful queen appease:<br/>
Her pride at length shall fall, her fury cease.<br/>
When thou return'st victorious from the war,<br/>
Perform thy vows to me with grateful care.<br/>
The god am I, whose yellow water flows<br/>
Around these fields, and fattens as it goes:<br/>
Tiber my name; among the rolling floods<br/>
Renown'd on earth, esteem'd among the gods.<br/>
This is my certain seat. In times to come,<br/>
My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome."
</p>
<p>
He said, and plung'd below. While yet he spoke,<br/>
His dream Aeneas and his sleep forsook.<br/>
He rose, and looking up, beheld the skies<br/>
With purple blushing, and the day arise.<br/>
Then water in his hollow palm he took<br/>
From Tiber's flood, and thus the pow'rs bespoke:<br/>
"Laurentian nymphs, by whom the streams are fed,<br/>
And Father Tiber, in thy sacred bed<br/>
Receive Aeneas, and from danger keep.<br/>
Whatever fount, whatever holy deep,<br/>
Conceals thy wat'ry stores; where'er they rise,<br/>
And, bubbling from below, salute the skies;<br/>
Thou, king of horned floods, whose plenteous urn<br/>
Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn,<br/>
For this thy kind compassion of our woes,<br/>
Shalt share my morning song and ev'ning vows.<br/>
But, O be present to thy people's aid,<br/>
And firm the gracious promise thou hast made!"<br/>
Thus having said, two galleys from his stores,<br/>
With care he chooses, mans, and fits with oars.<br/>
Now on the shore the fatal swine is found.<br/>
Wond'rous to tell!—She lay along the ground:<br/>
Her well-fed offspring at her udders hung;<br/>
She white herself, and white her thirty young.<br/>
Aeneas takes the mother and her brood,<br/>
And all on Juno's altar are bestow'd.
</p>
<p>
The foll'wing night, and the succeeding day,<br/>
Propitious Tiber smooth'd his wat'ry way:<br/>
He roll'd his river back, and pois'd he stood,<br/>
A gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood.<br/>
The Trojans mount their ships; they put from shore,<br/>
Borne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar.<br/>
Shouts from the land give omen to their course,<br/>
And the pitch'd vessels glide with easy force.<br/>
The woods and waters wonder at the gleam<br/>
Of shields, and painted ships that stem the stream.<br/>
One summer's night and one whole day they pass<br/>
Betwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass.<br/>
The fiery sun had finish'd half his race,<br/>
Look'd back, and doubted in the middle space,<br/>
When they from far beheld the rising tow'rs,<br/>
The tops of sheds, and shepherds' lowly bow'rs,<br/>
Thin as they stood, which, then of homely clay,<br/>
Now rise in marble, from the Roman sway.<br/>
These cots (Evander's kingdom, mean and poor)<br/>
The Trojan saw, and turn'd his ships to shore.<br/>
'Twas on a solemn day: th' Arcadian states,<br/>
The king and prince, without the city gates,<br/>
Then paid their off'rings in a sacred grove<br/>
To Hercules, the warrior son of Jove.<br/>
Thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies,<br/>
And fat of entrails on his altar fries.
</p>
<p>
But, when they saw the ships that stemm'd the flood,<br/>
And glitter'd thro' the covert of the wood,<br/>
They rose with fear, and left th' unfinish'd feast,<br/>
Till dauntless Pallas reassur'd the rest<br/>
To pay the rites. Himself without delay<br/>
A jav'lin seiz'd, and singly took his way;<br/>
Then gain'd a rising ground, and call'd from far:<br/>
"Resolve me, strangers, whence, and what you are;<br/>
Your bus'ness here; and bring you peace or war?"<br/>
High on the stern Aeneas took his stand,<br/>
And held a branch of olive in his hand,<br/>
While thus he spoke: "The Phrygians' arms you see,<br/>
Expell'd from Troy, provok'd in Italy<br/>
By Latian foes, with war unjustly made;<br/>
At first affianc'd, and at last betray'd.<br/>
This message bear: 'The Trojans and their chief<br/>
Bring holy peace, and beg the king's relief.'<br/>
Struck with so great a name, and all on fire,<br/>
The youth replies: "Whatever you require,<br/>
Your fame exacts. Upon our shores descend.<br/>
A welcome guest, and, what you wish, a friend."<br/>
He said, and, downward hasting to the strand,<br/>
Embrac'd the stranger prince, and join'd his hand.
</p>
<p>
Conducted to the grove, Aeneas broke<br/>
The silence first, and thus the king bespoke:<br/>
"Best of the Greeks, to whom, by fate's command,<br/>
I bear these peaceful branches in my hand,<br/>
Undaunted I approach you, tho' I know<br/>
Your birth is Grecian, and your land my foe;<br/>
From Atreus tho' your ancient lineage came,<br/>
And both the brother kings your kindred claim;<br/>
Yet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown,<br/>
Your virtue, thro' the neighb'ring nations blown,<br/>
Our fathers' mingled blood, Apollo's voice,<br/>
Have led me hither, less by need than choice.<br/>
Our founder Dardanus, as fame has sung,<br/>
And Greeks acknowledge, from Electra sprung:<br/>
Electra from the loins of Atlas came;<br/>
Atlas, whose head sustains the starry frame.<br/>
Your sire is Mercury, whom long before<br/>
On cold Cyllene's top fair Maia bore.<br/>
Maia the fair, on fame if we rely,<br/>
Was Atlas' daughter, who sustains the sky.<br/>
Thus from one common source our streams divide;<br/>
Ours is the Trojan, yours th' Arcadian side.<br/>
Rais'd by these hopes, I sent no news before,<br/>
Nor ask'd your leave, nor did your faith implore;<br/>
But come, without a pledge, my own ambassador.<br/>
The same Rutulians, who with arms pursue<br/>
The Trojan race, are equal foes to you.<br/>
Our host expell'd, what farther force can stay<br/>
The victor troops from universal sway?<br/>
Then will they stretch their pow'r athwart the land,<br/>
And either sea from side to side command.<br/>
Receive our offer'd faith, and give us thine;<br/>
Ours is a gen'rous and experienc'd line:<br/>
We want not hearts nor bodies for the war;<br/>
In council cautious, and in fields we dare."
</p>
<p>
He said; and while spoke, with piercing eyes<br/>
Evander view'd the man with vast surprise,<br/>
Pleas'd with his action, ravish'd with his face:<br/>
Then answer'd briefly, with a royal grace:<br/>
"O valiant leader of the Trojan line,<br/>
In whom the features of thy father shine,<br/>
How I recall Anchises! how I see<br/>
His motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee!<br/>
Long tho' it be, 'tis fresh within my mind,<br/>
When Priam to his sister's court design'd<br/>
A welcome visit, with a friendly stay,<br/>
And thro' th' Arcadian kingdom took his way.<br/>
Then, past a boy, the callow down began<br/>
To shade my chin, and call me first a man.<br/>
I saw the shining train with vast delight,<br/>
And Priam's goodly person pleas'd my sight:<br/>
But great Anchises, far above the rest,<br/>
With awful wonder fir'd my youthful breast.<br/>
I long'd to join in friendship's holy bands<br/>
Our mutual hearts, and plight our mutual hands.<br/>
I first accosted him: I sued, I sought,<br/>
And, with a loving force, to Pheneus brought.<br/>
He gave me, when at length constrain'd to go,<br/>
A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow,<br/>
A vest embroider'd, glorious to behold,<br/>
And two rich bridles, with their bits of gold,<br/>
Which my son's coursers in obedience hold.<br/>
The league you ask, I offer, as your right;<br/>
And, when tomorrow's sun reveals the light,<br/>
With swift supplies you shall be sent away.<br/>
Now celebrate with us this solemn day,<br/>
Whose holy rites admit no long delay.<br/>
Honour our annual feast; and take your seat,<br/>
With friendly welcome, at a homely treat."<br/>
Thus having said, the bowls remov'd (for fear)<br/>
The youths replac'd, and soon restor'd the cheer.<br/>
On sods of turf he set the soldiers round:<br/>
A maple throne, rais'd higher from the ground,<br/>
Receiv'd the Trojan chief; and, o'er the bed,<br/>
A lion's shaggy hide for ornament they spread.<br/>
The loaves were serv'd in canisters; the wine<br/>
In bowls; the priest renew'd the rites divine:<br/>
Broil'd entrails are their food, and beef's continued chine.
</p>
<p>
But when the rage of hunger was repress'd,<br/>
Thus spoke Evander to his royal guest:<br/>
"These rites, these altars, and this feast, O king,<br/>
From no vain fears or superstition spring,<br/>
Or blind devotion, or from blinder chance,<br/>
Or heady zeal, or brutal ignorance;<br/>
But, sav'd from danger, with a grateful sense,<br/>
The labours of a god we recompense.<br/>
See, from afar, yon rock that mates the sky,<br/>
About whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie;<br/>
Such indigested ruin; bleak and bare,<br/>
How desert now it stands, expos'd in air!<br/>
'Twas once a robber's den, inclos'd around<br/>
With living stone, and deep beneath the ground.<br/>
The monster Cacus, more than half a beast,<br/>
This hold, impervious to the sun, possess'd.<br/>
The pavement ever foul with human gore;<br/>
Heads, and their mangled members, hung the door.<br/>
Vulcan this plague begot; and, like his sire,<br/>
Black clouds he belch'd, and flakes of livid fire.<br/>
Time, long expected, eas'd us of our load,<br/>
And brought the needful presence of a god.<br/>
Th' avenging force of Hercules, from Spain,<br/>
Arriv'd in triumph, from Geryon slain:<br/>
Thrice liv'd the giant, and thrice liv'd in vain.<br/>
His prize, the lowing herds, Alcides drove<br/>
Near Tiber's bank, to graze the shady grove.<br/>
Allur'd with hope of plunder, and intent<br/>
By force to rob, by fraud to circumvent,<br/>
The brutal Cacus, as by chance they stray'd,<br/>
Four oxen thence, and four fair kine convey'd;<br/>
And, lest the printed footsteps might be seen,<br/>
He dragg'd 'em backwards to his rocky den.<br/>
The tracks averse a lying notice gave,<br/>
And led the searcher backward from the cave.
</p>
<p>
"Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place,<br/>
To find fresh pasture and untrodden grass.<br/>
The beasts, who miss'd their mates, fill'd all around<br/>
With bellowings, and the rocks restor'd the sound.<br/>
One heifer, who had heard her love complain,<br/>
Roar'd from the cave, and made the project vain.<br/>
Alcides found the fraud; with rage he shook,<br/>
And toss'd about his head his knotted oak.<br/>
Swift as the winds, or Scythian arrows' flight,<br/>
He clomb, with eager haste, th' aerial height.<br/>
Then first we saw the monster mend his pace;<br/>
Fear in his eyes, and paleness in his face,<br/>
Confess'd the god's approach. Trembling he springs,<br/>
As terror had increas'd his feet with wings;<br/>
Nor stay'd for stairs; but down the depth he threw<br/>
His body, on his back the door he drew<br/>
(The door, a rib of living rock; with pains<br/>
His father hew'd it out, and bound with iron chains):<br/>
He broke the heavy links, the mountain clos'd,<br/>
And bars and levers to his foe oppos'd.<br/>
The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast;<br/>
The fierce avenger came with bounding haste;<br/>
Survey'd the mouth of the forbidden hold,<br/>
And here and there his raging eyes he roll'd.<br/>
He gnash'd his teeth; and thrice he compass'd round<br/>
With winged speed the circuit of the ground.<br/>
Thrice at the cavern's mouth he pull'd in vain,<br/>
And, panting, thrice desisted from his pain.<br/>
A pointed flinty rock, all bare and black,<br/>
Grew gibbous from behind the mountain's back;<br/>
Owls, ravens, all ill omens of the night,<br/>
Here built their nests, and hither wing'd their flight.<br/>
The leaning head hung threat'ning o'er the flood,<br/>
And nodded to the left. The hero stood<br/>
Adverse, with planted feet, and, from the right,<br/>
Tugg'd at the solid stone with all his might.<br/>
Thus heav'd, the fix'd foundations of the rock<br/>
Gave way; heav'n echo'd at the rattling shock.<br/>
Tumbling, it chok'd the flood: on either side<br/>
The banks leap backward, and the streams divide;<br/>
The sky shrunk upward with unusual dread,<br/>
And trembling Tiber div'd beneath his bed.<br/>
The court of Cacus stands reveal'd to sight;<br/>
The cavern glares with new-admitted light.<br/>
So the pent vapours, with a rumbling sound,<br/>
Heave from below, and rend the hollow ground;<br/>
A sounding flaw succeeds; and, from on high,<br/>
The gods with hate beheld the nether sky:<br/>
The ghosts repine at violated night,<br/>
And curse th' invading sun, and sicken at the sight.<br/>
The graceless monster, caught in open day,<br/>
Inclos'd, and in despair to fly away,<br/>
Howls horrible from underneath, and fills<br/>
His hollow palace with unmanly yells.<br/>
The hero stands above, and from afar<br/>
Plies him with darts, and stones, and distant war.<br/>
He, from his nostrils' huge mouth, expires<br/>
Black clouds of smoke, amidst his father's fires,<br/>
Gath'ring, with each repeated blast, the night,<br/>
To make uncertain aim, and erring sight.<br/>
The wrathful god then plunges from above,<br/>
And, where in thickest waves the sparkles drove,<br/>
There lights; and wades thro' fumes, and gropes his way,<br/>
Half sing'd, half stifled, till he grasps his prey.<br/>
The monster, spewing fruitless flames, he found;<br/>
He squeez'd his throat; he writh'd his neck around,<br/>
And in a knot his crippled members bound;<br/>
Then from their sockets tore his burning eyes:<br/>
Roll'd on a heap, the breathless robber lies.<br/>
The doors, unbarr'd, receive the rushing day,<br/>
And thoro' lights disclose the ravish'd prey.<br/>
The bulls, redeem'd, breathe open air again.<br/>
Next, by the feet, they drag him from his den.<br/>
The wond'ring neighbourhood, with glad surprise,<br/>
Behold his shagged breast, his giant size,<br/>
His mouth that flames no more, and his extinguish'd eyes.<br/>
From that auspicious day, with rites divine,<br/>
We worship at the hero's holy shrine.<br/>
Potitius first ordain'd these annual vows:<br/>
As priests, were added the Pinarian house,<br/>
Who rais'd this altar in the sacred shade,<br/>
Where honours, ever due, for ever shall be paid.<br/>
For these deserts, and this high virtue shown,<br/>
Ye warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown:<br/>
Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood,<br/>
And with deep draughts invoke our common god."
</p>
<p>
This said, a double wreath Evander twin'd,<br/>
And poplars black and white his temples bind.<br/>
Then brims his ample bowl. With like design<br/>
The rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine.<br/>
Meantime the sun descended from the skies,<br/>
And the bright evening star began to rise.<br/>
And now the priests, Potitius at their head,<br/>
In skins of beasts involv'd, the long procession led;<br/>
Held high the flaming tapers in their hands,<br/>
As custom had prescrib'd their holy bands;<br/>
Then with a second course the tables load,<br/>
And with full chargers offer to the god.<br/>
The Salii sing, and cense his altars round<br/>
With Saban smoke, their heads with poplar bound<br/>
One choir of old, another of the young,<br/>
To dance, and bear the burthen of the song.<br/>
The lay records the labours, and the praise,<br/>
And all th' immortal acts of Hercules:<br/>
First, how the mighty babe, when swath'd in bands,<br/>
The serpents strangled with his infant hands;<br/>
Then, as in years and matchless force he grew,<br/>
Th' Oechalian walls, and Trojan, overthrew.<br/>
Besides, a thousand hazards they relate,<br/>
Procur'd by Juno's and Eurystheus' hate:<br/>
"Thy hands, unconquer'd hero, could subdue<br/>
The cloud-born Centaurs, and the monster crew:<br/>
Nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood,<br/>
Nor he, the roaring terror of the wood.<br/>
The triple porter of the Stygian seat,<br/>
With lolling tongue, lay fawning at thy feet,<br/>
And, seiz'd with fear, forgot his mangled meat.<br/>
Th' infernal waters trembled at thy sight;<br/>
Thee, god, no face of danger could affright;<br/>
Not huge Typhoeus, nor th' unnumber'd snake,<br/>
Increas'd with hissing heads, in Lerna's lake.<br/>
Hail, Jove's undoubted son! an added grace<br/>
To heav'n and the great author of thy race!<br/>
Receive the grateful off'rings which we pay,<br/>
And smile propitious on thy solemn day!"<br/>
In numbers thus they sung; above the rest,<br/>
The den and death of Cacus crown the feast.<br/>
The woods to hollow vales convey the sound,<br/>
The vales to hills, and hills the notes rebound.<br/>
The rites perform'd, the cheerful train retire.
</p>
<p>
Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire,<br/>
The Trojan pass'd, the city to survey,<br/>
And pleasing talk beguil'd the tedious way.<br/>
The stranger cast around his curious eyes,<br/>
New objects viewing still, with new surprise;<br/>
With greedy joy enquires of various things,<br/>
And acts and monuments of ancient kings.<br/>
Then thus the founder of the Roman tow'rs:<br/>
"These woods were first the seat of sylvan pow'rs,<br/>
Of Nymphs and Fauns, and salvage men, who took<br/>
Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak.<br/>
Nor laws they knew, nor manners, nor the care<br/>
Of lab'ring oxen, or the shining share,<br/>
Nor arts of gain, nor what they gain'd to spare.<br/>
Their exercise the chase; the running flood<br/>
Supplied their thirst, the trees supplied their food.<br/>
Then Saturn came, who fled the pow'r of Jove,<br/>
Robb'd of his realms, and banish'd from above.<br/>
The men, dispers'd on hills, to towns he brought,<br/>
And laws ordain'd, and civil customs taught,<br/>
And Latium call'd the land where safe he lay<br/>
From his unduteous son, and his usurping sway.<br/>
With his mild empire, peace and plenty came;<br/>
And hence the golden times deriv'd their name.<br/>
A more degenerate and discolour'd age<br/>
Succeeded this, with avarice and rage.<br/>
Th' Ausonians then, and bold Sicanians came;<br/>
And Saturn's empire often chang'd the name.<br/>
Then kings, gigantic Tybris, and the rest,<br/>
With arbitrary sway the land oppress'd:<br/>
For Tiber's flood was Albula before,<br/>
Till, from the tyrant's fate, his name it bore.<br/>
I last arriv'd, driv'n from my native home<br/>
By fortune's pow'r, and fate's resistless doom.<br/>
Long toss'd on seas, I sought this happy land,<br/>
Warn'd by my mother nymph, and call'd by Heav'n's command."
</p>
<p>
Thus, walking on, he spoke, and shew'd the gate,<br/>
Since call'd Carmental by the Roman state;<br/>
Where stood an altar, sacred to the name<br/>
Of old Carmenta, the prophetic dame,<br/>
Who to her son foretold th' Aenean race,<br/>
Sublime in fame, and Rome's imperial place:<br/>
Then shews the forest, which, in after times,<br/>
Fierce Romulus for perpetrated crimes<br/>
A sacred refuge made; with this, the shrine<br/>
Where Pan below the rock had rites divine:<br/>
Then tells of Argus' death, his murder'd guest,<br/>
Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest.<br/>
Thence, to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads;<br/>
Now roof'd with gold, then thatch'd with homely reeds.<br/>
A reverent fear (such superstition reigns<br/>
Among the rude) ev'n then possess'd the swains.<br/>
Some god, they knew—what god, they could not tell—<br/>
Did there amidst the sacred horror dwell.<br/>
Th' Arcadians thought him Jove; and said they saw<br/>
The mighty Thund'rer with majestic awe,<br/>
Who took his shield, and dealt his bolts around,<br/>
And scatter'd tempests on the teeming ground.<br/>
Then saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood<br/>
Two stately towns, on either side the flood,)<br/>
Saturnia's and Janiculum's remains;<br/>
And either place the founder's name retains.<br/>
Discoursing thus together, they resort<br/>
Where poor Evander kept his country court.<br/>
They view'd the ground of Rome's litigious hall;<br/>
(Once oxen low'd, where now the lawyers bawl;)<br/>
Then, stooping, thro' the narrow gate they press'd,<br/>
When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest:<br/>
"Mean as it is, this palace, and this door,<br/>
Receiv'd Alcides, then a conqueror.<br/>
Dare to be poor; accept our homely food,<br/>
Which feasted him, and emulate a god."<br/>
Then underneath a lowly roof he led<br/>
The weary prince, and laid him on a bed;<br/>
The stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o'erspread.<br/>
Now night had shed her silver dews around,<br/>
And with her sable wings embrac'd the ground,<br/>
When love's fair goddess, anxious for her son,<br/>
(New tumults rising, and new wars begun,)<br/>
Couch'd with her husband in his golden bed,<br/>
With these alluring words invokes his aid;<br/>
And, that her pleasing speech his mind may move,<br/>
Inspires each accent with the charms of love:<br/>
"While cruel fate conspir'd with Grecian pow'rs,<br/>
To level with the ground the Trojan tow'rs,<br/>
I ask'd not aid th' unhappy to restore,<br/>
Nor did the succour of thy skill implore;<br/>
Nor urg'd the labours of my lord in vain,<br/>
A sinking empire longer to sustain,<br/>
Tho' much I ow'd to Priam's house, and more<br/>
The dangers of Aeneas did deplore.<br/>
But now, by Jove's command, and fate's decree,<br/>
His race is doom'd to reign in Italy:<br/>
With humble suit I beg thy needful art,<br/>
O still propitious pow'r, that rules my heart!<br/>
A mother kneels a suppliant for her son.<br/>
By Thetis and Aurora thou wert won<br/>
To forge impenetrable shields, and grace<br/>
With fated arms a less illustrious race.<br/>
Behold, what haughty nations are combin'd<br/>
Against the relics of the Phrygian kind,<br/>
With fire and sword my people to destroy,<br/>
And conquer Venus twice, in conqu'ring Troy."<br/>
She said; and straight her arms, of snowy hue,<br/>
About her unresolving husband threw.<br/>
Her soft embraces soon infuse desire;<br/>
His bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire;<br/>
And all the godhead feels the wonted fire.<br/>
Not half so swift the rattling thunder flies,<br/>
Or forky lightnings flash along the skies.<br/>
The goddess, proud of her successful wiles,<br/>
And conscious of her form, in secret smiles.
</p>
<p>
Then thus the pow'r, obnoxious to her charms,<br/>
Panting, and half dissolving in her arms:<br/>
"Why seek you reasons for a cause so just,<br/>
Or your own beauties or my love distrust?<br/>
Long since, had you requir'd my helpful hand,<br/>
Th' artificer and art you might command,<br/>
To labour arms for Troy: nor Jove, nor fate,<br/>
Confin'd their empire to so short a date.<br/>
And, if you now desire new wars to wage,<br/>
My skill I promise, and my pains engage.<br/>
Whatever melting metals can conspire,<br/>
Or breathing bellows, or the forming fire,<br/>
Is freely yours: your anxious fears remove,<br/>
And think no task is difficult to love."<br/>
Trembling he spoke; and, eager of her charms,<br/>
He snatch'd the willing goddess to his arms;<br/>
Till in her lap infus'd, he lay possess'd<br/>
Of full desire, and sunk to pleasing rest.<br/>
Now when the night her middle race had rode,<br/>
And his first slumber had refresh'd the god—<br/>
The time when early housewives leave the bed;<br/>
When living embers on the hearth they spread,<br/>
Supply the lamp, and call the maids to rise;—<br/>
With yawning mouths, and with half-open'd eyes,<br/>
They ply the distaff by the winking light,<br/>
And to their daily labour add the night:<br/>
Thus frugally they earn their children's bread,<br/>
And uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed—<br/>
Not less concern'd, nor at a later hour,<br/>
Rose from his downy couch the forging pow'r.
</p>
<p>
Sacred to Vulcan's name, an isle there lay,<br/>
Betwixt Sicilia's coasts and Lipare,<br/>
Rais'd high on smoking rocks; and, deep below,<br/>
In hollow caves the fires of Aetna glow.<br/>
The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal;<br/>
Loud strokes, and hissings of tormented steel,<br/>
Are heard around; the boiling waters roar,<br/>
And smoky flames thro' fuming tunnels soar.<br/>
Hither the Father of the Fire, by night,<br/>
Thro' the brown air precipitates his flight.<br/>
On their eternal anvils here he found<br/>
The brethren beating, and the blows go round.<br/>
A load of pointless thunder now there lies<br/>
Before their hands, to ripen for the skies:<br/>
These darts, for angry Jove, they daily cast;<br/>
Consum'd on mortals with prodigious waste.<br/>
Three rays of writhen rain, of fire three more,<br/>
Of winged southern winds and cloudy store<br/>
As many parts, the dreadful mixture frame;<br/>
And fears are added, and avenging flame.<br/>
Inferior ministers, for Mars, repair<br/>
His broken axletrees and blunted war,<br/>
And send him forth again with furbish'd arms,<br/>
To wake the lazy war with trumpets' loud alarms.<br/>
The rest refresh the scaly snakes that fold<br/>
The shield of Pallas, and renew their gold.<br/>
Full on the crest the Gorgon's head they place,<br/>
With eyes that roll in death, and with distorted face.
</p>
<p>
"My sons," said Vulcan, "set your tasks aside;<br/>
Your strength and master-skill must now be tried.<br/>
Arms for a hero forge; arms that require<br/>
Your force, your speed, and all your forming fire."<br/>
He said. They set their former work aside,<br/>
And their new toils with eager haste divide.<br/>
A flood of molten silver, brass, and gold,<br/>
And deadly steel, in the large furnace roll'd;<br/>
Of this, their artful hands a shield prepare,<br/>
Alone sufficient to sustain the war.<br/>
Sev'n orbs within a spacious round they close:<br/>
One stirs the fire, and one the bellows blows.<br/>
The hissing steel is in the smithy drown'd;<br/>
The grot with beaten anvils groans around.<br/>
By turns their arms advance, in equal time;<br/>
By turns their hands descend, and hammers chime.<br/>
They turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs;<br/>
The fiery work proceeds, with rustic songs.
</p>
<p>
While, at the Lemnian god's command, they urge<br/>
Their labours thus, and ply th' Aeolian forge,<br/>
The cheerful morn salutes Evander's eyes,<br/>
And songs of chirping birds invite to rise.<br/>
He leaves his lowly bed: his buskins meet<br/>
Above his ankles; sandals sheathe his feet:<br/>
He sets his trusty sword upon his side,<br/>
And o'er his shoulder throws a panther's hide.<br/>
Two menial dogs before their master press'd.<br/>
Thus clad, and guarded thus, he seeks his kingly guest.<br/>
Mindful of promis'd aid, he mends his pace,<br/>
But meets Aeneas in the middle space.<br/>
Young Pallas did his father's steps attend,<br/>
And true Achates waited on his friend.<br/>
They join their hands; a secret seat they choose;<br/>
Th' Arcadian first their former talk renews:<br/>
"Undaunted prince, I never can believe<br/>
The Trojan empire lost, while you survive.<br/>
Command th' assistance of a faithful friend;<br/>
But feeble are the succours I can send.<br/>
Our narrow kingdom here the Tiber bounds;<br/>
That other side the Latian state surrounds,<br/>
Insults our walls, and wastes our fruitful grounds.<br/>
But mighty nations I prepare, to join<br/>
Their arms with yours, and aid your just design.<br/>
You come, as by your better genius sent,<br/>
And fortune seems to favour your intent.<br/>
Not far from hence there stands a hilly town,<br/>
Of ancient building, and of high renown,<br/>
Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race,<br/>
Who gave the name of Caere to the place,<br/>
Once Agyllina call'd. It flourish'd long,<br/>
In pride of wealth and warlike people strong,<br/>
Till curs'd Mezentius, in a fatal hour,<br/>
Assum'd the crown, with arbitrary pow'r.<br/>
What words can paint those execrable times,<br/>
The subjects' suff'rings, and the tyrant's crimes!<br/>
That blood, those murders, O ye gods, replace<br/>
On his own head, and on his impious race!<br/>
The living and the dead at his command<br/>
Were coupled, face to face, and hand to hand,<br/>
Till, chok'd with stench, in loath'd embraces tied,<br/>
The ling'ring wretches pin'd away and died.<br/>
Thus plung'd in ills, and meditating more—<br/>
The people's patience, tir'd, no longer bore<br/>
The raging monster; but with arms beset<br/>
His house, and vengeance and destruction threat.<br/>
They fire his palace: while the flame ascends,<br/>
They force his guards, and execute his friends.<br/>
He cleaves the crowd, and, favour'd by the night,<br/>
To Turnus' friendly court directs his flight.<br/>
By just revenge the Tuscans set on fire,<br/>
With arms, their king to punishment require:<br/>
Their num'rous troops, now muster'd on the strand,<br/>
My counsel shall submit to your command.<br/>
Their navy swarms upon the coasts; they cry<br/>
To hoist their anchors, but the gods deny.<br/>
An ancient augur, skill'd in future fate,<br/>
With these foreboding words restrains their hate:<br/>
'Ye brave in arms, ye Lydian blood, the flow'r<br/>
Of Tuscan youth, and choice of all their pow'r,<br/>
Whom just revenge against Mezentius arms,<br/>
To seek your tyrant's death by lawful arms;<br/>
Know this: no native of our land may lead<br/>
This pow'rful people; seek a foreign head.'<br/>
Aw'd with these words, in camps they still abide,<br/>
And wait with longing looks their promis'd guide.<br/>
Tarchon, the Tuscan chief, to me has sent<br/>
Their crown, and ev'ry regal ornament:<br/>
The people join their own with his desire;<br/>
And all my conduct, as their king, require.<br/>
But the chill blood that creeps within my veins,<br/>
And age, and listless limbs unfit for pains,<br/>
And a soul conscious of its own decay,<br/>
Have forc'd me to refuse imperial sway.<br/>
My Pallas were more fit to mount the throne,<br/>
And should, but he's a Sabine mother's son,<br/>
And half a native; but, in you, combine<br/>
A manly vigour, and a foreign line.<br/>
Where Fate and smiling Fortune shew the way,<br/>
Pursue the ready path to sov'reign sway.<br/>
The staff of my declining days, my son,<br/>
Shall make your good or ill success his own;<br/>
In fighting fields from you shall learn to dare,<br/>
And serve the hard apprenticeship of war;<br/>
Your matchless courage and your conduct view,<br/>
And early shall begin t' admire and copy you.<br/>
Besides, two hundred horse he shall command;<br/>
Tho' few, a warlike and well-chosen band.<br/>
These in my name are listed; and my son<br/>
As many more has added in his own."
</p>
<p>
Scarce had he said; Achates and his guest,<br/>
With downcast eyes, their silent grief express'd;<br/>
Who, short of succours, and in deep despair,<br/>
Shook at the dismal prospect of the war.<br/>
But his bright mother, from a breaking cloud,<br/>
To cheer her issue, thunder'd thrice aloud;<br/>
Thrice forky lightning flash'd along the sky,<br/>
And Tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high.<br/>
Then, gazing up, repeated peals they hear;<br/>
And, in a heav'n serene, refulgent arms appear:<br/>
Redd'ning the skies, and glitt'ring all around,<br/>
The temper'd metals clash, and yield a silver sound.<br/>
The rest stood trembling, struck with awe divine;<br/>
Aeneas only, conscious to the sign,<br/>
Presag'd th' event, and joyful view'd, above,<br/>
Th' accomplish'd promise of the Queen of Love.<br/>
Then, to th' Arcadian king: "This prodigy<br/>
(Dismiss your fear) belongs alone to me.<br/>
Heav'n calls me to the war: th' expected sign<br/>
Is giv'n of promis'd aid, and arms divine.<br/>
My goddess mother, whose indulgent care<br/>
Foresaw the dangers of the growing war,<br/>
This omen gave, when bright Vulcanian arms,<br/>
Fated from force of steel by Stygian charms,<br/>
Suspended, shone on high: she then foreshow'd<br/>
Approaching fights, and fields to float in blood.<br/>
Turnus shall dearly pay for faith forsworn;<br/>
And corps, and swords, and shields, on Tiber borne,<br/>
Shall choke his flood: now sound the loud alarms;<br/>
And, Latian troops, prepare your perjur'd arms."
</p>
<p>
He said, and, rising from his homely throne,<br/>
The solemn rites of Hercules begun,<br/>
And on his altars wak'd the sleeping fires;<br/>
Then cheerful to his household gods retires;<br/>
There offers chosen sheep. Th' Arcadian king<br/>
And Trojan youth the same oblations bring.<br/>
Next, of his men and ships he makes review;<br/>
Draws out the best and ablest of the crew.<br/>
Down with the falling stream the refuse run,<br/>
To raise with joyful news his drooping son.<br/>
Steeds are prepar'd to mount the Trojan band,<br/>
Who wait their leader to the Tyrrhene land.<br/>
A sprightly courser, fairer than the rest,<br/>
The king himself presents his royal guest:<br/>
A lion's hide his back and limbs infold,<br/>
Precious with studded work, and paws of gold.<br/>
Fame thro' the little city spreads aloud<br/>
Th' intended march, amid the fearful crowd:<br/>
The matrons beat their breasts, dissolve in tears,<br/>
And double their devotion in their fears.<br/>
The war at hand appears with more affright,<br/>
And rises ev'ry moment to the sight.
</p>
<p>
Then old Evander, with a close embrace,<br/>
Strain'd his departing friend; and tears o'erflow his face.<br/>
"Would Heav'n," said he, "my strength and youth recall,<br/>
Such as I was beneath Praeneste's wall;<br/>
Then when I made the foremost foes retire,<br/>
And set whole heaps of conquer'd shields on fire;<br/>
When Herilus in single fight I slew,<br/>
Whom with three lives Feronia did endue;<br/>
And thrice I sent him to the Stygian shore,<br/>
Till the last ebbing soul return'd no more—<br/>
Such if I stood renew'd, not these alarms,<br/>
Nor death, should rend me from my Pallas' arms;<br/>
Nor proud Mezentius, thus unpunish'd, boast<br/>
His rapes and murders on the Tuscan coast.<br/>
Ye gods, and mighty Jove, in pity bring<br/>
Relief, and hear a father and a king!<br/>
If fate and you reserve these eyes, to see<br/>
My son return with peace and victory;<br/>
If the lov'd boy shall bless his father's sight;<br/>
If we shall meet again with more delight;<br/>
Then draw my life in length; let me sustain,<br/>
In hopes of his embrace, the worst of pain.<br/>
But if your hard decrees—which, O! I dread—<br/>
Have doom'd to death his undeserving head;<br/>
This, O this very moment, let me die!<br/>
While hopes and fears in equal balance lie;<br/>
While, yet possess'd of all his youthful charms,<br/>
I strain him close within these aged arms;<br/>
Before that fatal news my soul shall wound!"<br/>
He said, and, swooning, sunk upon the ground.<br/>
His servants bore him off, and softly laid<br/>
His languish'd limbs upon his homely bed.
</p>
<p>
The horsemen march; the gates are open'd wide;<br/>
Aeneas at their head, Achates by his side.<br/>
Next these, the Trojan leaders rode along;<br/>
Last follows in the rear th' Arcadian throng.<br/>
Young Pallas shone conspicuous o'er the rest;<br/>
Gilded his arms, embroider'd was his vest.<br/>
So, from the seas, exerts his radiant head<br/>
The star by whom the lights of heav'n are led;<br/>
Shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews,<br/>
Dispels the darkness, and the day renews.<br/>
The trembling wives the walls and turrets crowd,<br/>
And follow, with their eyes, the dusty cloud,<br/>
Which winds disperse by fits, and shew from far<br/>
The blaze of arms, and shields, and shining war.<br/>
The troops, drawn up in beautiful array,<br/>
O'er heathy plains pursue the ready way.<br/>
Repeated peals of shouts are heard around;<br/>
The neighing coursers answer to the sound,<br/>
And shake with horny hoofs the solid ground.
</p>
<p>
A greenwood shade, for long religion known,<br/>
Stands by the streams that wash the Tuscan town,<br/>
Incompass'd round with gloomy hills above,<br/>
Which add a holy horror to the grove.<br/>
The first inhabitants of Grecian blood,<br/>
That sacred forest to Silvanus vow'd,<br/>
The guardian of their flocks and fields; and pay<br/>
Their due devotions on his annual day.<br/>
Not far from hence, along the river's side,<br/>
In tents secure, the Tuscan troops abide,<br/>
By Tarchon led. Now, from a rising ground,<br/>
Aeneas cast his wond'ring eyes around,<br/>
And all the Tyrrhene army had in sight,<br/>
Stretch'd on the spacious plain from left to right.<br/>
Thither his warlike train the Trojan led,<br/>
Refresh'd his men, and wearied horses fed.
</p>
<p>
Meantime the mother goddess, crown'd with charms,<br/>
Breaks thro' the clouds, and brings the fated arms.<br/>
Within a winding vale she finds her son,<br/>
On the cool river's banks, retir'd alone.<br/>
She shews her heav'nly form without disguise,<br/>
And gives herself to his desiring eyes.<br/>
"Behold," she said, "perform'd in ev'ry part,<br/>
My promise made, and Vulcan's labour'd art.<br/>
Now seek, secure, the Latian enemy,<br/>
And haughty Turnus to the field defy."<br/>
She said; and, having first her son embrac'd,<br/>
The radiant arms beneath an oak she plac'd,<br/>
Proud of the gift, he roll'd his greedy sight<br/>
Around the work, and gaz'd with vast delight.<br/>
He lifts, he turns, he poises, and admires<br/>
The crested helm, that vomits radiant fires:<br/>
His hands the fatal sword and corslet hold,<br/>
One keen with temper'd steel, one stiff with gold:<br/>
Both ample, flaming both, and beamy bright;<br/>
So shines a cloud, when edg'd with adverse light.<br/>
He shakes the pointed spear, and longs to try<br/>
The plated cuishes on his manly thigh;<br/>
But most admires the shield's mysterious mould,<br/>
And Roman triumphs rising on the gold:<br/>
For these, emboss'd, the heav'nly smith had wrought<br/>
(Not in the rolls of future fate untaught)<br/>
The wars in order, and the race divine<br/>
Of warriors issuing from the Julian line.<br/>
The cave of Mars was dress'd with mossy greens:<br/>
There, by the wolf, were laid the martial twins.<br/>
Intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung;<br/>
The foster dam loll'd out her fawning tongue:<br/>
They suck'd secure, while, bending back her head,<br/>
She lick'd their tender limbs, and form'd them as they fed.<br/>
Not far from thence new Rome appears, with games<br/>
Projected for the rape of Sabine dames.<br/>
The pit resounds with shrieks; a war succeeds,<br/>
For breach of public faith, and unexampled deeds.<br/>
Here for revenge the Sabine troops contend;<br/>
The Romans there with arms the prey defend.<br/>
Wearied with tedious war, at length they cease;<br/>
And both the kings and kingdoms plight the peace.<br/>
The friendly chiefs before Jove's altar stand,<br/>
Both arm'd, with each a charger in his hand:<br/>
A fatted sow for sacrifice is led,<br/>
With imprecations on the perjur'd head.<br/>
Near this, the traitor Metius, stretch'd between<br/>
Four fiery steeds, is dragg'd along the green,<br/>
By Tullus' doom: the brambles drink his blood,<br/>
And his torn limbs are left the vulture's food.<br/>
There, Porsena to Rome proud Tarquin brings,<br/>
And would by force restore the banish'd kings.<br/>
One tyrant for his fellow-tyrant fights;<br/>
The Roman youth assert their native rights.<br/>
Before the town the Tuscan army lies,<br/>
To win by famine, or by fraud surprise.<br/>
Their king, half-threat'ning, half-disdaining stood,<br/>
While Cocles broke the bridge, and stemm'd the flood.<br/>
The captive maids there tempt the raging tide,<br/>
Scap'd from their chains, with Cloelia for their guide.<br/>
High on a rock heroic Manlius stood,<br/>
To guard the temple, and the temple's god.<br/>
Then Rome was poor; and there you might behold<br/>
The palace thatch'd with straw, now roof'd with gold.<br/>
The silver goose before the shining gate<br/>
There flew, and, by her cackle, sav'd the state.<br/>
She told the Gauls' approach; th' approaching Gauls,<br/>
Obscure in night, ascend, and seize the walls.<br/>
The gold dissembled well their yellow hair,<br/>
And golden chains on their white necks they wear.<br/>
Gold are their vests; long Alpine spears they wield,<br/>
And their left arm sustains a length of shield.<br/>
Hard by, the leaping Salian priests advance;<br/>
And naked thro' the streets the mad Luperci dance,<br/>
In caps of wool; the targets dropp'd from heav'n.<br/>
Here modest matrons, in soft litters driv'n,<br/>
To pay their vows in solemn pomp appear,<br/>
And odorous gums in their chaste hands they bear.<br/>
Far hence remov'd, the Stygian seats are seen;<br/>
Pains of the damn'd, and punish'd Catiline<br/>
Hung on a rock—the traitor; and, around,<br/>
The Furies hissing from the nether ground.<br/>
Apart from these, the happy souls he draws,<br/>
And Cato's holy ghost dispensing laws.
</p>
<p>
Betwixt the quarters flows a golden sea;<br/>
But foaming surges there in silver play.<br/>
The dancing dolphins with their tails divide<br/>
The glitt'ring waves, and cut the precious tide.<br/>
Amid the main, two mighty fleets engage<br/>
Their brazen beaks, oppos'd with equal rage.<br/>
Actium surveys the well-disputed prize;<br/>
Leucate's wat'ry plain with foamy billows fries.<br/>
Young Caesar, on the stern, in armour bright,<br/>
Here leads the Romans and their gods to fight:<br/>
His beamy temples shoot their flames afar,<br/>
And o'er his head is hung the Julian star.<br/>
Agrippa seconds him, with prosp'rous gales,<br/>
And, with propitious gods, his foes assails:<br/>
A naval crown, that binds his manly brows,<br/>
The happy fortune of the fight foreshows.<br/>
Rang'd on the line oppos'd, Antonius brings<br/>
Barbarian aids, and troops of Eastern kings;<br/>
Th' Arabians near, and Bactrians from afar,<br/>
Of tongues discordant, and a mingled war:<br/>
And, rich in gaudy robes, amidst the strife,<br/>
His ill fate follows him—th' Egyptian wife.<br/>
Moving they fight; with oars and forky prows<br/>
The froth is gather'd, and the water glows.<br/>
It seems, as if the Cyclades again<br/>
Were rooted up, and justled in the main;<br/>
Or floating mountains floating mountains meet;<br/>
Such is the fierce encounter of the fleet.<br/>
Fireballs are thrown, and pointed jav'lins fly;<br/>
The fields of Neptune take a purple dye.<br/>
The queen herself, amidst the loud alarms,<br/>
With cymbals toss'd her fainting soldiers warms—<br/>
Fool as she was! who had not yet divin'd<br/>
Her cruel fate, nor saw the snakes behind.<br/>
Her country gods, the monsters of the sky,<br/>
Great Neptune, Pallas, and Love's Queen defy:<br/>
The dog Anubis barks, but barks in vain,<br/>
Nor longer dares oppose th' ethereal train.<br/>
Mars in the middle of the shining shield<br/>
Is grav'd, and strides along the liquid field.<br/>
The Dirae souse from heav'n with swift descent;<br/>
And Discord, dyed in blood, with garments rent,<br/>
Divides the prease: her steps Bellona treads,<br/>
And shakes her iron rod above their heads.<br/>
This seen, Apollo, from his Actian height,<br/>
Pours down his arrows; at whose winged flight<br/>
The trembling Indians and Egyptians yield,<br/>
And soft Sabaeans quit the wat'ry field.<br/>
The fatal mistress hoists her silken sails,<br/>
And, shrinking from the fight, invokes the gales.<br/>
Aghast she looks, and heaves her breast for breath,<br/>
Panting, and pale with fear of future death.<br/>
The god had figur'd her as driv'n along<br/>
By winds and waves, and scudding thro' the throng.<br/>
Just opposite, sad Nilus opens wide<br/>
His arms and ample bosom to the tide,<br/>
And spreads his mantle o'er the winding coast,<br/>
In which he wraps his queen, and hides the flying host.<br/>
The victor to the gods his thanks express'd,<br/>
And Rome, triumphant, with his presence bless'd.<br/>
Three hundred temples in the town he plac'd;<br/>
With spoils and altars ev'ry temple grac'd.<br/>
Three shining nights, and three succeeding days,<br/>
The fields resound with shouts, the streets with praise,<br/>
The domes with songs, the theatres with plays.<br/>
All altars flame: before each altar lies,<br/>
Drench'd in his gore, the destin'd sacrifice.<br/>
Great Caesar sits sublime upon his throne,<br/>
Before Apollo's porch of Parian stone;<br/>
Accepts the presents vow'd for victory,<br/>
And hangs the monumental crowns on high.<br/>
Vast crowds of vanquish'd nations march along,<br/>
Various in arms, in habit, and in tongue.<br/>
Here, Mulciber assigns the proper place<br/>
For Carians, and th' ungirt Numidian race;<br/>
Then ranks the Thracians in the second row,<br/>
With Scythians, expert in the dart and bow.<br/>
And here the tam'd Euphrates humbly glides,<br/>
And there the Rhine submits her swelling tides,<br/>
And proud Araxes, whom no bridge could bind;<br/>
The Danes' unconquer'd offspring march behind,<br/>
And Morini, the last of humankind.
</p>
<p>
These figures, on the shield divinely wrought,<br/>
By Vulcan labour'd, and by Venus brought,<br/>
With joy and wonder fill the hero's thought.<br/>
Unknown the names, he yet admires the grace,<br/>
And bears aloft the fame and fortune of his race.

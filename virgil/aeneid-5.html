<h1>Aeneid</h1>
<h2>by Virgil</h2>
<h3>Book V</h3>
<p>
Meantime the Trojan cuts his wat'ry way,<br/>
Fix'd on his voyage, thro' the curling sea;<br/>
Then, casting back his eyes, with dire amaze,<br/>
Sees on the Punic shore the mounting blaze.<br/>
The cause unknown; yet his presaging mind<br/>
The fate of Dido from the fire divin'd;<br/>
He knew the stormy souls of womankind,<br/>
What secret springs their eager passions move,<br/>
How capable of death for injur'd love.<br/>
Dire auguries from hence the Trojans draw;<br/>
Till neither fires nor shining shores they saw.<br/>
Now seas and skies their prospect only bound;<br/>
An empty space above, a floating field around.<br/>
But soon the heav'ns with shadows were o'erspread;<br/>
A swelling cloud hung hov'ring o'er their head:<br/>
Livid it look'd, the threat'ning of a storm:<br/>
Then night and horror ocean's face deform.<br/>
The pilot, Palinurus, cried aloud:<br/>
"What gusts of weather from that gath'ring cloud<br/>
My thoughts presage! Ere yet the tempest roars,<br/>
Stand to your tackle, mates, and stretch your oars;<br/>
Contract your swelling sails, and luff to wind."<br/>
The frighted crew perform the task assign'd.<br/>
Then, to his fearless chief: "Not Heav'n," said he,<br/>
"Tho' Jove himself should promise Italy,<br/>
Can stem the torrent of this raging sea.<br/>
Mark how the shifting winds from west arise,<br/>
And what collected night involves the skies!<br/>
Nor can our shaken vessels live at sea,<br/>
Much less against the tempest force their way.<br/>
'Tis fate diverts our course, and fate we must obey.<br/>
Not far from hence, if I observ'd aright<br/>
The southing of the stars, and polar light,<br/>
Sicilia lies, whose hospitable shores<br/>
In safety we may reach with struggling oars."<br/>
Aeneas then replied: "Too sure I find<br/>
We strive in vain against the seas and wind:<br/>
Now shift your sails; what place can please me more<br/>
Than what you promise, the Sicilian shore,<br/>
Whose hallow'd earth Anchises' bones contains,<br/>
And where a prince of Trojan lineage reigns?"<br/>
The course resolv'd, before the western wind<br/>
They scud amain, and make the port assign'd.<br/>
Meantime Acestes, from a lofty stand,<br/>
Beheld the fleet descending on the land;<br/>
And, not unmindful of his ancient race,<br/>
Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace,<br/>
And held the hero in a strict embrace.<br/>
Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore,<br/>
And either hand a pointed jav'lin bore.<br/>
His mother was a dame of Dardan blood;<br/>
His sire Crinisus, a Sicilian flood.<br/>
He welcomes his returning friends ashore<br/>
With plenteous country cates and homely store.
</p>
<p>
Now, when the following morn had chas'd away<br/>
The flying stars, and light restor'd the day,<br/>
Aeneas call'd the Trojan troops around,<br/>
And thus bespoke them from a rising ground:<br/>
"Offspring of heav'n, divine Dardanian race!<br/>
The sun, revolving thro' th' ethereal space,<br/>
The shining circle of the year has fill'd,<br/>
Since first this isle my father's ashes held:<br/>
And now the rising day renews the year;<br/>
A day for ever sad, for ever dear.<br/>
This would I celebrate with annual games,<br/>
With gifts on altars pil'd, and holy flames,<br/>
Tho' banish'd to Gaetulia's barren sands,<br/>
Caught on the Grecian seas, or hostile lands:<br/>
But since this happy storm our fleet has driv'n<br/>
(Not, as I deem, without the will of Heav'n)<br/>
Upon these friendly shores and flow'ry plains,<br/>
Which hide Anchises and his blest remains,<br/>
Let us with joy perform his honours due,<br/>
And pray for prosp'rous winds, our voyage to renew;<br/>
Pray, that in towns and temples of our own,<br/>
The name of great Anchises may be known,<br/>
And yearly games may spread the gods' renown.<br/>
Our sports Acestes, of the Trojan race,<br/>
With royal gifts ordain'd, is pleas'd to grace:<br/>
Two steers on ev'ry ship the king bestows;<br/>
His gods and ours shall share your equal vows.<br/>
Besides, if, nine days hence, the rosy morn<br/>
Shall with unclouded light the skies adorn,<br/>
That day with solemn sports I mean to grace:<br/>
Light galleys on the seas shall run a wat'ry race;<br/>
Some shall in swiftness for the goal contend,<br/>
And others try the twanging bow to bend;<br/>
The strong, with iron gauntlets arm'd, shall stand<br/>
Oppos'd in combat on the yellow sand.<br/>
Let all be present at the games prepar'd,<br/>
And joyful victors wait the just reward.<br/>
But now assist the rites, with garlands crown'd."<br/>
He said, and first his brows with myrtle bound.<br/>
Then Helymus, by his example led,<br/>
And old Acestes, each adorn'd his head;<br/>
Thus young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace,<br/>
His temples tied, and all the Trojan race.
</p>
<p>
Aeneas then advanc'd amidst the train,<br/>
By thousands follow'd thro' the flow'ry plain,<br/>
To great Anchises' tomb; which when he found,<br/>
He pour'd to Bacchus, on the hallow'd ground,<br/>
Two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more,<br/>
And two from offer'd bulls of purple gore,<br/>
With roses then the sepulcher he strow'd<br/>
And thus his father's ghost bespoke aloud:<br/>
"Hail, O ye holy manes! hail again,<br/>
Paternal ashes, now review'd in vain!<br/>
The gods permitted not, that you, with me,<br/>
Should reach the promis'd shores of Italy,<br/>
Or Tiber's flood, what flood soe'er it be."<br/>
Scarce had he finish'd, when, with speckled pride,<br/>
A serpent from the tomb began to glide;<br/>
His hugy bulk on sev'n high volumes roll'd;<br/>
Blue was his breadth of back, but streak'd with scaly gold:<br/>
Thus riding on his curls, he seem'd to pass<br/>
A rolling fire along, and singe the grass.<br/>
More various colours thro' his body run,<br/>
Than Iris when her bow imbibes the sun.<br/>
Betwixt the rising altars, and around,<br/>
The sacred monster shot along the ground;<br/>
With harmless play amidst the bowls he pass'd,<br/>
And with his lolling tongue assay'd the taste:<br/>
Thus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest<br/>
Within the hollow tomb retir'd to rest.<br/>
The pious prince, surpris'd at what he view'd,<br/>
The fun'ral honours with more zeal renew'd,<br/>
Doubtful if this place's genius were,<br/>
Or guardian of his father's sepulcher.<br/>
Five sheep, according to the rites, he slew;<br/>
As many swine, and steers of sable hue;<br/>
New gen'rous wine he from the goblets pour'd.<br/>
And call'd his father's ghost, from hell restor'd.<br/>
The glad attendants in long order come,<br/>
Off'ring their gifts at great Anchises' tomb:<br/>
Some add more oxen: some divide the spoil;<br/>
Some place the chargers on the grassy soil;<br/>
Some blow the fires, and offered entrails broil.
</p>
<p>
Now came the day desir'd. The skies were bright<br/>
With rosy luster of the rising light:<br/>
The bord'ring people, rous'd by sounding fame<br/>
Of Trojan feasts and great Acestes' name,<br/>
The crowded shore with acclamations fill,<br/>
Part to behold, and part to prove their skill.<br/>
And first the gifts in public view they place,<br/>
Green laurel wreaths, and palm, the victors' grace:<br/>
Within the circle, arms and tripods lie,<br/>
Ingots of gold and silver, heap'd on high,<br/>
And vests embroider'd, of the Tyrian dye.<br/>
The trumpet's clangour then the feast proclaims,<br/>
And all prepare for their appointed games.<br/>
Four galleys first, which equal rowers bear,<br/>
Advancing, in the wat'ry lists appear.<br/>
The speedy Dolphin, that outstrips the wind,<br/>
Bore Mnestheus, author of the Memmian kind:<br/>
Gyas the vast Chimaera's bulk commands,<br/>
Which rising, like a tow'ring city stands;<br/>
Three Trojans tug at ev'ry lab'ring oar;<br/>
Three banks in three degrees the sailors bore;<br/>
Beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar.<br/>
Sergesthus, who began the Sergian race,<br/>
In the great Centaur took the leading place;<br/>
Cloanthus on the sea-green Scylla stood,<br/>
From whom Cluentius draws his Trojan blood.
</p>
<p>
Far in the sea, against the foaming shore,<br/>
There stands a rock: the raging billows roar<br/>
Above his head in storms; but, when 'tis clear,<br/>
Uncurl their ridgy backs, and at his foot appear.<br/>
In peace below the gentle waters run;<br/>
The cormorants above lie basking in the sun.<br/>
On this the hero fix'd an oak in sight,<br/>
The mark to guide the mariners aright.<br/>
To bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars;<br/>
Then round the rock they steer, and seek the former shores.<br/>
The lots decide their place. Above the rest,<br/>
Each leader shining in his Tyrian vest;<br/>
The common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs<br/>
Their temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows:<br/>
Besmear'd with oil, their naked shoulders shine.<br/>
All take their seats, and wait the sounding sign:<br/>
They gripe their oars; and ev'ry panting breast<br/>
Is rais'd by turns with hope, by turns with fear depress'd.<br/>
The clangour of the trumpet gives the sign;<br/>
At once they start, advancing in a line:<br/>
With shouts the sailors rend the starry skies;<br/>
Lash'd with their oars, the smoky billows rise;<br/>
Sparkles the briny main, and the vex'd ocean fries.<br/>
Exact in time, with equal strokes they row:<br/>
At once the brushing oars and brazen prow<br/>
Dash up the sandy waves, and ope the depths below.<br/>
Not fiery coursers, in a chariot race,<br/>
Invade the field with half so swift a pace;<br/>
Not the fierce driver with more fury lends<br/>
The sounding lash, and, ere the stroke descends,<br/>
Low to the wheels his pliant body bends.<br/>
The partial crowd their hopes and fears divide,<br/>
And aid with eager shouts the favour'd side.<br/>
Cries, murmurs, clamours, with a mixing sound,<br/>
From woods to woods, from hills to hills rebound.
</p>
<p>
Amidst the loud applauses of the shore,<br/>
Gyas outstripp'd the rest, and sprung before:<br/>
Cloanthus, better mann'd, pursued him fast,<br/>
But his o'er-masted galley check'd his haste.<br/>
The Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine<br/>
With equal oars, advancing in a line;<br/>
And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead,<br/>
And now the speedy Dolphin gets ahead;<br/>
Now board to board the rival vessels row,<br/>
The billows lave the skies, and ocean groans below.<br/>
They reach'd the mark; proud Gyas and his train<br/>
In triumph rode, the victors of the main;<br/>
But, steering round, he charg'd his pilot stand<br/>
More close to shore, and skim along the sand.<br/>
"Let others bear to sea!" Menoetes heard;<br/>
But secret shelves too cautiously he fear'd,<br/>
And, fearing, sought the deep; and still aloof he steer'd.<br/>
With louder cries the captain call'd again:<br/>
"Bear to the rocky shore, and shun the main."<br/>
He spoke, and, speaking, at his stern he saw<br/>
The bold Cloanthus near the shelvings draw.<br/>
Betwixt the mark and him the Scylla stood,<br/>
And in a closer compass plow'd the flood.<br/>
He pass'd the mark; and, wheeling, got before:<br/>
Gyas blasphem'd the gods, devoutly swore,<br/>
Cried out for anger, and his hair he tore.<br/>
Mindless of others' lives (so high was grown<br/>
His rising rage) and careless of his own,<br/>
The trembling dotard to the deck he drew;<br/>
Then hoisted up, and overboard he threw:<br/>
This done, he seiz'd the helm; his fellows cheer'd,<br/>
Turn'd short upon the shelfs, and madly steer'd.
</p>
<p>
Hardly his head the plunging pilot rears,<br/>
Clogg'd with his clothes, and cumber'd with his years:<br/>
Now dropping wet, he climbs the cliff with pain.<br/>
The crowd, that saw him fall and float again,<br/>
Shout from the distant shore; and loudly laugh'd,<br/>
To see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught.<br/>
The following Centaur, and the Dolphin's crew,<br/>
Their vanish'd hopes of victory renew;<br/>
While Gyas lags, they kindle in the race,<br/>
To reach the mark. Sergesthus takes the place;<br/>
Mnestheus pursues; and while around they wind,<br/>
Comes up, not half his galley's length behind;<br/>
Then, on the deck, amidst his mates appear'd,<br/>
And thus their drooping courages he cheer'd:<br/>
"My friends, and Hector's followers heretofore,<br/>
Exert your vigour; tug the lab'ring oar;<br/>
Stretch to your strokes, my still unconquer'd crew,<br/>
Whom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew.<br/>
In this, our common int'rest, let me find<br/>
That strength of hand, that courage of the mind,<br/>
As when you stemm'd the strong Malean flood,<br/>
And o'er the Syrtes' broken billows row'd.<br/>
I seek not now the foremost palm to gain;<br/>
Tho' yet——But, ah! that haughty wish is vain!<br/>
Let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain.<br/>
But to be last, the lags of all the race!<br/>
Redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace."<br/>
Now, one and all, they tug amain; they row<br/>
At the full stretch, and shake the brazen prow.<br/>
The sea beneath 'em sinks; their lab'ring sides<br/>
Are swell'd, and sweat runs gutt'ring down in tides.<br/>
Chance aids their daring with unhop'd success;<br/>
Sergesthus, eager with his beak to press<br/>
Betwixt the rival galley and the rock,<br/>
Shuts up th' unwieldly Centaur in the lock.<br/>
The vessel struck; and, with the dreadful shock,<br/>
Her oars she shiver'd, and her head she broke.<br/>
The trembling rowers from their banks arise,<br/>
And, anxious for themselves, renounce the prize.<br/>
With iron poles they heave her off the shores,<br/>
And gather from the sea their floating oars.<br/>
The crew of Mnestheus, with elated minds,<br/>
Urge their success, and call the willing winds;<br/>
Then ply their oars, and cut their liquid way<br/>
In larger compass on the roomy sea.<br/>
As, when the dove her rocky hold forsakes,<br/>
Rous'd in a fright, her sounding wings she shakes;<br/>
The cavern rings with clatt'ring; out she flies,<br/>
And leaves her callow care, and cleaves the skies:<br/>
At first she flutters; but at length she springs<br/>
To smoother flight, and shoots upon her wings:<br/>
So Mnestheus in the Dolphin cuts the sea;<br/>
And, flying with a force, that force assists his way.<br/>
Sergesthus in the Centaur soon he pass'd,<br/>
Wedg'd in the rocky shoals, and sticking fast.<br/>
In vain the victor he with cries implores,<br/>
And practices to row with shatter'd oars.<br/>
Then Mnestheus bears with Gyas, and outflies:<br/>
The ship, without a pilot, yields the prize.<br/>
Unvanquish'd Scylla now alone remains;<br/>
Her he pursues, and all his vigour strains.<br/>
Shouts from the fav'ring multitude arise;<br/>
Applauding Echo to the shouts replies;<br/>
Shouts, wishes, and applause run rattling thro' the skies.<br/>
These clamours with disdain the Scylla heard,<br/>
Much grudg'd the praise, but more the robb'd reward:<br/>
Resolv'd to hold their own, they mend their pace,<br/>
All obstinate to die, or gain the race.<br/>
Rais'd with success, the Dolphin swiftly ran;<br/>
For they can conquer, who believe they can.<br/>
Both urge their oars, and fortune both supplies,<br/>
And both perhaps had shar'd an equal prize;<br/>
When to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands,<br/>
And succour from the wat'ry pow'rs demands:<br/>
"Gods of the liquid realms, on which I row!<br/>
If, giv'n by you, the laurel bind my brow,<br/>
Assist to make me guilty of my vow!<br/>
A snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain;<br/>
His offer'd entrails cast into the main,<br/>
And ruddy wine, from golden goblets thrown,<br/>
Your grateful gift and my return shall own."<br/>
The choir of nymphs, and Phorcus, from below,<br/>
With virgin Panopea, heard his vow;<br/>
And old Portunus, with his breadth of hand,<br/>
Push'd on, and sped the galley to the land.<br/>
Swift as a shaft, or winged wind, she flies,<br/>
And, darting to the port, obtains the prize.
</p>
<p>
The herald summons all, and then proclaims<br/>
Cloanthus conqu'ror of the naval games.<br/>
The prince with laurel crowns the victor's head,<br/>
And three fat steers are to his vessel led,<br/>
The ship's reward; with gen'rous wine beside,<br/>
And sums of silver, which the crew divide.<br/>
The leaders are distinguish'd from the rest;<br/>
The victor honour'd with a nobler vest,<br/>
Where gold and purple strive in equal rows,<br/>
And needlework its happy cost bestows.<br/>
There Ganymede is wrought with living art,<br/>
Chasing thro' Ida's groves the trembling hart:<br/>
Breathless he seems, yet eager to pursue;<br/>
When from aloft descends, in open view,<br/>
The bird of Jove, and, sousing on his prey,<br/>
With crooked talons bears the boy away.<br/>
In vain, with lifted hands and gazing eyes,<br/>
His guards behold him soaring thro' the skies,<br/>
And dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries.
</p>
<p>
Mnestheus the second victor was declar'd;<br/>
And, summon'd there, the second prize he shar'd.<br/>
A coat of mail, brave Demoleus bore,<br/>
More brave Aeneas from his shoulders tore,<br/>
In single combat on the Trojan shore:<br/>
This was ordain'd for Mnestheus to possess;<br/>
In war for his defence, for ornament in peace.<br/>
Rich was the gift, and glorious to behold,<br/>
But yet so pond'rous with its plates of gold,<br/>
That scarce two servants could the weight sustain;<br/>
Yet, loaded thus, Demoleus o'er the plain<br/>
Pursued and lightly seiz'd the Trojan train.<br/>
The third, succeeding to the last reward,<br/>
Two goodly bowls of massy silver shar'd,<br/>
With figures prominent, and richly wrought,<br/>
And two brass caldrons from Dodona brought.
</p>
<p>
Thus all, rewarded by the hero's hands,<br/>
Their conqu'ring temples bound with purple bands;<br/>
And now Sergesthus, clearing from the rock,<br/>
Brought back his galley shatter'd with the shock.<br/>
Forlorn she look'd, without an aiding oar,<br/>
And, houted by the vulgar, made to shore.<br/>
As when a snake, surpris'd upon the road,<br/>
Is crush'd athwart her body by the load<br/>
Of heavy wheels; or with a mortal wound<br/>
Her belly bruis'd, and trodden to the ground:<br/>
In vain, with loosen'd curls, she crawls along;<br/>
Yet, fierce above, she brandishes her tongue;<br/>
Glares with her eyes, and bristles with her scales;<br/>
But, groveling in the dust, her parts unsound she trails:<br/>
So slowly to the port the Centaur tends,<br/>
But, what she wants in oars, with sails amends.<br/>
Yet, for his galley sav'd, the grateful prince<br/>
Is pleas'd th' unhappy chief to recompense.<br/>
Pholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care,<br/>
Beauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair.
</p>
<p>
From thence his way the Trojan hero bent<br/>
Into the neighb'ring plain, with mountains pent,<br/>
Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood.<br/>
Full in the midst of this fair valley stood<br/>
A native theatre, which, rising slow<br/>
By just degrees, o'erlook'd the ground below.<br/>
High on a sylvan throne the leader sate;<br/>
A num'rous train attend in solemn state.<br/>
Here those that in the rapid course delight,<br/>
Desire of honour and the prize invite.<br/>
The rival runners without order stand;<br/>
The Trojans mix'd with the Sicilian band.<br/>
First Nisus, with Euryalus, appears;<br/>
Euryalus a boy of blooming years,<br/>
With sprightly grace and equal beauty crown'd;<br/>
Nisus, for friendship to the youth renown'd.<br/>
Diores next, of Priam's royal race,<br/>
Then Salius joined with Patron, took their place;<br/>
But Patron in Arcadia had his birth,<br/>
And Salius his from Arcananian earth;<br/>
Then two Sicilian youths, the names of these,<br/>
Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes:<br/>
Both jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred,<br/>
And owning old Acestes for their head;<br/>
With sev'ral others of ignobler name,<br/>
Whom time has not deliver'd o'er to fame.
</p>
<p>
To these the hero thus his thoughts explain'd,<br/>
In words which gen'ral approbation gain'd:<br/>
"One common largess is for all design'd,<br/>
The vanquish'd and the victor shall be join'd,<br/>
Two darts of polish'd steel and Gnosian wood,<br/>
A silver-studded ax alike bestow'd.<br/>
The foremost three have olive wreaths decreed:<br/>
The first of these obtains a stately steed,<br/>
Adorn'd with trappings; and the next in fame,<br/>
The quiver of an Amazonian dame,<br/>
With feather'd Thracian arrows well supplied:<br/>
A golden belt shall gird his manly side,<br/>
Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied.<br/>
The third this Grecian helmet shall content."<br/>
He said. To their appointed base they went;<br/>
With beating hearts th' expected sign receive,<br/>
And, starting all at once, the barrier leave.<br/>
Spread out, as on the winged winds, they flew,<br/>
And seiz'd the distant goal with greedy view.<br/>
Shot from the crowd, swift Nisus all o'erpass'd;<br/>
Nor storms, nor thunder, equal half his haste.<br/>
The next, but tho' the next, yet far disjoin'd,<br/>
Came Salius, and Euryalus behind;<br/>
Then Helymus, whom young Diores plied,<br/>
Step after step, and almost side by side,<br/>
His shoulders pressing; and, in longer space,<br/>
Had won, or left at least a dubious race.
</p>
<p>
Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last,<br/>
When eager Nisus, hapless in his haste,<br/>
Slipp'd first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain,<br/>
Soak'd with the blood of oxen newly slain.<br/>
The careless victor had not mark'd his way;<br/>
But, treading where the treach'rous puddle lay,<br/>
His heels flew up; and on the grassy floor<br/>
He fell, besmear'd with filth and holy gore.<br/>
Not mindless then, Euryalus, of thee,<br/>
Nor of the sacred bonds of amity,<br/>
He strove th' immediate rival's hope to cross,<br/>
And caught the foot of Salius as he rose.<br/>
So Salius lay extended on the plain;<br/>
Euryalus springs out, the prize to gain,<br/>
And leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend<br/>
The victor to the goal, who vanquish'd by his friend.<br/>
Next Helymus; and then Diores came,<br/>
By two misfortunes made the third in fame.
</p>
<p>
But Salius enters, and, exclaiming loud<br/>
For justice, deafens and disturbs the crowd;<br/>
Urges his cause may in the court be heard;<br/>
And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr'd.<br/>
But favour for Euryalus appears;<br/>
His blooming beauty, with his tender tears,<br/>
Had brib'd the judges for the promis'd prize.<br/>
Besides, Diores fills the court with cries,<br/>
Who vainly reaches at the last reward,<br/>
If the first palm on Salius be conferr'd.<br/>
Then thus the prince: "Let no disputes arise:<br/>
Where fortune plac'd it, I award the prize.<br/>
But fortune's errors give me leave to mend,<br/>
At least to pity my deserving friend."<br/>
He said, and, from among the spoils, he draws<br/>
(Pond'rous with shaggy mane and golden paws)<br/>
A lion's hide: to Salius this he gives.<br/>
Nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves.<br/>
"If such rewards to vanquish'd men are due,"<br/>
He said, "and falling is to rise by you,<br/>
What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim,<br/>
Who merited the first rewards and fame?<br/>
In falling, both an equal fortune tried;<br/>
Would fortune for my fall so well provide!"<br/>
With this he pointed to his face, and show'd<br/>
His hand and all his habit smear'd with blood.<br/>
Th' indulgent father of the people smil'd,<br/>
And caus'd to be produc'd an ample shield,<br/>
Of wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought,<br/>
Long since from Neptune's bars in triumph brought.<br/>
This giv'n to Nisus, he divides the rest,<br/>
And equal justice in his gifts express'd.
</p>
<p>
The race thus ended, and rewards bestow'd,<br/>
Once more the prince bespeaks th' attentive crowd:<br/>
"If there be here, whose dauntless courage dare<br/>
In gauntlet fight, with limbs and body bare,<br/>
His opposite sustain in open view,<br/>
Stand forth the champion, and the games renew.<br/>
Two prizes I propose, and thus divide:<br/>
A bull with gilded horns, and fillets tied,<br/>
Shall be the portion of the conqu'ring chief;<br/>
A sword and helm shall cheer the loser's grief."
</p>
<p>
Then haughty Dares in the lists appears;<br/>
Stalking he strides, his head erected bears:<br/>
His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,<br/>
And loud applauses echo thro' the field.<br/>
Dares alone in combat us'd to stand<br/>
The match of mighty Paris, hand to hand;<br/>
The same, at Hector's fun'rals, undertook<br/>
Gigantic Butes, of th' Amycian stock,<br/>
And, by the stroke of his resistless hand,<br/>
Stretch'd the vast bulk upon the yellow sand.<br/>
Such Dares was; and such he strode along,<br/>
And drew the wonder of the gazing throng.<br/>
His brawny back and ample breast he shows,<br/>
His lifted arms around his head he throws,<br/>
And deals in whistling air his empty blows.<br/>
His match is sought; but, thro' the trembling band,<br/>
Not one dares answer to the proud demand.<br/>
Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes<br/>
Already he devours the promis'd prize.<br/>
He claims the bull with awless insolence,<br/>
And having seiz'd his horns, accosts the prince:<br/>
"If none my matchless valour dares oppose,<br/>
How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes?<br/>
Permit me, chief, permit without delay,<br/>
To lead this uncontended gift away."<br/>
The crowd assents, and with redoubled cries<br/>
For the proud challenger demands the prize.
</p>
<p>
Acestes, fir'd with just disdain, to see<br/>
The palm usurp'd without a victory,<br/>
Reproach'd Entellus thus, who sate beside,<br/>
And heard and saw, unmov'd, the Trojan's pride:<br/>
"Once, but in vain, a champion of renown,<br/>
So tamely can you bear the ravish'd crown,<br/>
A prize in triumph borne before your sight,<br/>
And shun, for fear, the danger of the fight?<br/>
Where is our Eryx now, the boasted name,<br/>
The god who taught your thund'ring arm the game?<br/>
Where now your baffled honour? Where the spoil<br/>
That fill'd your house, and fame that fill'd our isle?"<br/>
Entellus, thus: "My soul is still the same,<br/>
Unmov'd with fear, and mov'd with martial fame;<br/>
But my chill blood is curdled in my veins,<br/>
And scarce the shadow of a man remains.<br/>
O could I turn to that fair prime again,<br/>
That prime of which this boaster is so vain,<br/>
The brave, who this decrepid age defies,<br/>
Should feel my force, without the promis'd prize."
</p>
<p>
He said; and, rising at the word, he threw<br/>
Two pond'rous gauntlets down in open view;<br/>
Gauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield,<br/>
And sheathe his hands within the listed field.<br/>
With fear and wonder seiz'd, the crowd beholds<br/>
The gloves of death, with sev'n distinguish'd folds<br/>
Of tough bull hides; the space within is spread<br/>
With iron, or with loads of heavy lead:<br/>
Dares himself was daunted at the sight,<br/>
Renounc'd his challenge, and refus'd to fight.<br/>
Astonish'd at their weight, the hero stands,<br/>
And pois'd the pond'rous engines in his hands.<br/>
"What had your wonder," said Entellus, "been,<br/>
Had you the gauntlets of Alcides seen,<br/>
Or view'd the stern debate on this unhappy green!<br/>
These which I bear your brother Eryx bore,<br/>
Still mark'd with batter'd brains and mingled gore.<br/>
With these he long sustain'd th' Herculean arm;<br/>
And these I wielded while my blood was warm,<br/>
This languish'd frame while better spirits fed,<br/>
Ere age unstrung my nerves, or time o'ersnow'd my head.<br/>
But if the challenger these arms refuse,<br/>
And cannot wield their weight, or dare not use;<br/>
If great Aeneas and Acestes join<br/>
In his request, these gauntlets I resign;<br/>
Let us with equal arms perform the fight,<br/>
And let him leave to fear, since I resign my right."
</p>
<p>
This said, Entellus for the strife prepares;<br/>
Stripp'd of his quilted coat, his body bares;<br/>
Compos'd of mighty bones and brawn he stands,<br/>
A goodly tow'ring object on the sands.<br/>
Then just Aeneas equal arms supplied,<br/>
Which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied.<br/>
Both on the tiptoe stand, at full extent,<br/>
Their arms aloft, their bodies inly bent;<br/>
Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar;<br/>
With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war.<br/>
One on his youth and pliant limbs relies;<br/>
One on his sinews and his giant size.<br/>
The last is stiff with age, his motion slow;<br/>
He heaves for breath, he staggers to and fro,<br/>
And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow.<br/>
Yet equal in success, they ward, they strike;<br/>
Their ways are diff'rent, but their art alike.<br/>
Before, behind, the blows are dealt; around<br/>
Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound.<br/>
A storm of strokes, well meant, with fury flies,<br/>
And errs about their temples, ears, and eyes.<br/>
Nor always errs; for oft the gauntlet draws<br/>
A sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws.<br/>
Heavy with age, Entellus stands his ground,<br/>
But with his warping body wards the wound.<br/>
His hand and watchful eye keep even pace;<br/>
While Dares traverses and shifts his place,<br/>
And, like a captain who beleaguers round<br/>
Some strong-built castle on a rising ground,<br/>
Views all th' approaches with observing eyes:<br/>
This and that other part in vain he tries,<br/>
And more on industry than force relies.<br/>
With hands on high, Entellus threats the foe;<br/>
But Dares watch'd the motion from below,<br/>
And slipp'd aside, and shunn'd the long descending blow.<br/>
Entellus wastes his forces on the wind,<br/>
And, thus deluded of the stroke design'd,<br/>
Headlong and heavy fell; his ample breast<br/>
And weighty limbs his ancient mother press'd.<br/>
So falls a hollow pine, that long had stood<br/>
On Ida's height, or Erymanthus' wood,<br/>
Torn from the roots. The diff'ring nations rise,<br/>
And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies,<br/>
Acestus runs with eager haste, to raise<br/>
The fall'n companion of his youthful days.<br/>
Dauntless he rose, and to the fight return'd;<br/>
With shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn'd.<br/>
Disdain and conscious virtue fir'd his breast,<br/>
And with redoubled force his foe he press'd.<br/>
He lays on load with either hand, amain,<br/>
And headlong drives the Trojan o'er the plain;<br/>
Nor stops, nor stays; nor rest nor breath allows;<br/>
But storms of strokes descend about his brows,<br/>
A rattling tempest, and a hail of blows.<br/>
But now the prince, who saw the wild increase<br/>
Of wounds, commands the combatants to cease,<br/>
And bounds Entellus' wrath, and bids the peace.<br/>
First to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came,<br/>
And sooth'd his sorrow for the suffer'd shame.<br/>
"What fury seiz'd my friend? The gods," said he,<br/>
"To him propitious, and averse to thee,<br/>
Have giv'n his arm superior force to thine.<br/>
'Tis madness to contend with strength divine."<br/>
The gauntlet fight thus ended, from the shore<br/>
His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore:<br/>
His mouth and nostrils pour'd a purple flood,<br/>
And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.<br/>
Faintly he stagger'd thro' the hissing throng,<br/>
And hung his head, and trail'd his legs along.<br/>
The sword and casque are carried by his train;<br/>
But with his foe the palm and ox remain.
</p>
<p>
The champion, then, before Aeneas came,<br/>
Proud of his prize, but prouder of his fame:<br/>
"O goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host,<br/>
Mark with attention, and forgive my boast;<br/>
Learn what I was, by what remains; and know<br/>
From what impending fate you sav'd my foe."<br/>
Sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull;<br/>
And, on his ample forehead aiming full,<br/>
The deadly stroke, descending, pierc'd the skull.<br/>
Down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound,<br/>
But sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground.<br/>
Then, thus: "In Dares' stead I offer this.<br/>
Eryx, accept a nobler sacrifice;<br/>
Take the last gift my wither'd arms can yield:<br/>
Thy gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field."
</p>
<p>
This done, Aeneas orders, for the close,<br/>
The strife of archers with contending bows.<br/>
The mast Sergesthus' shatter'd galley bore<br/>
With his own hands he raises on the shore.<br/>
A flutt'ring dove upon the top they tie,<br/>
The living mark at which their arrows fly.<br/>
The rival archers in a line advance,<br/>
Their turn of shooting to receive from chance.<br/>
A helmet holds their names; the lots are drawn:<br/>
On the first scroll was read Hippocoon.<br/>
The people shout. Upon the next was found<br/>
Young Mnestheus, late with naval honours crown'd.<br/>
The third contain'd Eurytion's noble name,<br/>
Thy brother, Pandarus, and next in fame,<br/>
Whom Pallas urg'd the treaty to confound,<br/>
And send among the Greeks a feather'd wound.<br/>
Acestes in the bottom last remain'd,<br/>
Whom not his age from youthful sports restrain'd.<br/>
Soon all with vigour bend their trusty bows,<br/>
And from the quiver each his arrow chose.<br/>
Hippocoon's was the first: with forceful sway<br/>
It flew, and, whizzing, cut the liquid way.<br/>
Fix'd in the mast the feather'd weapon stands:<br/>
The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands,<br/>
And the tree trembled, and the shouting cries<br/>
Of the pleas'd people rend the vaulted skies.<br/>
Then Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove,<br/>
With lifted eyes, and took his aim above,<br/>
But made a glancing shot, and missed the dove;<br/>
Yet miss'd so narrow, that he cut the cord<br/>
Which fasten'd by the foot the flitting bird.<br/>
The captive thus releas'd, away she flies,<br/>
And beats with clapping wings the yielding skies.<br/>
His bow already bent, Eurytion stood;<br/>
And, having first invok'd his brother god,<br/>
His winged shaft with eager haste he sped.<br/>
The fatal message reach'd her as she fled:<br/>
She leaves her life aloft; she strikes the ground,<br/>
And renders back the weapon in the wound.<br/>
Acestes, grudging at his lot, remains,<br/>
Without a prize to gratify his pains.<br/>
Yet, shooting upward, sends his shaft, to show<br/>
An archer's art, and boast his twanging bow.<br/>
The feather'd arrow gave a dire portent,<br/>
And latter augurs judge from this event.<br/>
Chaf'd by the speed, it fir'd; and, as it flew,<br/>
A trail of following flames ascending drew:<br/>
Kindling they mount, and mark the shiny way;<br/>
Across the skies as falling meteors play,<br/>
And vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay.<br/>
The Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare,<br/>
And, trembling, turn their wonder into pray'r.<br/>
The Dardan prince put on a smiling face,<br/>
And strain'd Acestes with a close embrace;<br/>
Then, hon'ring him with gifts above the rest,<br/>
Turn'd the bad omen, nor his fears confess'd.<br/>
"The gods," said he, "this miracle have wrought,<br/>
And order'd you the prize without the lot.<br/>
Accept this goblet, rough with figur'd gold,<br/>
Which Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old:<br/>
This pledge of ancient amity receive,<br/>
Which to my second sire I justly give."<br/>
He said, and, with the trumpets' cheerful sound,<br/>
Proclaim'd him victor, and with laurel-crown'd.<br/>
Nor good Eurytion envied him the prize,<br/>
Tho' he transfix'd the pigeon in the skies.<br/>
Who cut the line, with second gifts was grac'd;<br/>
The third was his whose arrow pierc'd the mast.
</p>
<p>
The chief, before the games were wholly done,<br/>
Call'd Periphantes, tutor to his son,<br/>
And whisper'd thus: "With speed Ascanius find;<br/>
And, if his childish troop be ready join'd,<br/>
On horseback let him grace his grandsire's day,<br/>
And lead his equals arm'd in just array."<br/>
He said; and, calling out, the cirque he clears.<br/>
The crowd withdrawn, an open plain appears.<br/>
And now the noble youths, of form divine,<br/>
Advance before their fathers, in a line;<br/>
The riders grace the steeds; the steeds with glory shine.
</p>
<p>
Thus marching on in military pride,<br/>
Shouts of applause resound from side to side.<br/>
Their casques adorn'd with laurel wreaths they wear,<br/>
Each brandishing aloft a cornel spear.<br/>
Some at their backs their gilded quivers bore;<br/>
Their chains of burnish'd gold hung down before.<br/>
Three graceful troops they form'd upon the green;<br/>
Three graceful leaders at their head were seen;<br/>
Twelve follow'd ev'ry chief, and left a space between.<br/>
The first young Priam led; a lovely boy,<br/>
Whose grandsire was th' unhappy king of Troy;<br/>
His race in after times was known to fame,<br/>
New honours adding to the Latian name;<br/>
And well the royal boy his Thracian steed became.<br/>
White were the fetlocks of his feet before,<br/>
And on his front a snowy star he bore.<br/>
Then beauteous Atys, with Iulus bred,<br/>
Of equal age, the second squadron led.<br/>
The last in order, but the first in place,<br/>
First in the lovely features of his face,<br/>
Rode fair Ascanius on a fiery steed,<br/>
Queen Dido's gift, and of the Tyrian breed.<br/>
Sure coursers for the rest the king ordains,<br/>
With golden bits adorn'd, and purple reins.
</p>
<p>
The pleas'd spectators peals of shouts renew,<br/>
And all the parents in the children view;<br/>
Their make, their motions, and their sprightly grace,<br/>
And hopes and fears alternate in their face.
</p>
<p>
Th' unfledg'd commanders and their martial train<br/>
First make the circuit of the sandy plain<br/>
Around their sires, and, at th' appointed sign,<br/>
Drawn up in beauteous order, form a line.<br/>
The second signal sounds, the troop divides<br/>
In three distinguish'd parts, with three distinguish'd guides<br/>
Again they close, and once again disjoin;<br/>
In troop to troop oppos'd, and line to line.<br/>
They meet; they wheel; they throw their darts afar<br/>
With harmless rage and well-dissembled war.<br/>
Then in a round the mingled bodies run:<br/>
Flying they follow, and pursuing shun;<br/>
Broken, they break; and, rallying, they renew<br/>
In other forms the military shew.<br/>
At last, in order, undiscern'd they join,<br/>
And march together in a friendly line.<br/>
And, as the Cretan labyrinth of old,<br/>
With wand'ring ways and many a winding fold,<br/>
Involv'd the weary feet, without redress,<br/>
In a round error, which denied recess;<br/>
So fought the Trojan boys in warlike play,<br/>
Turn'd and return'd, and still a diff'rent way.<br/>
Thus dolphins in the deep each other chase<br/>
In circles, when they swim around the wat'ry race.<br/>
This game, these carousels, Ascanius taught;<br/>
And, building Alba, to the Latins brought;<br/>
Shew'd what he learn'd: the Latin sires impart<br/>
To their succeeding sons the graceful art;<br/>
From these imperial Rome receiv'd the game,<br/>
Which Troy, the youths the Trojan troop, they name.
</p>
<p>
Thus far the sacred sports they celebrate:<br/>
But Fortune soon resum'd her ancient hate;<br/>
For, while they pay the dead his annual dues,<br/>
Those envied rites Saturnian Juno views;<br/>
And sends the goddess of the various bow,<br/>
To try new methods of revenge below;<br/>
Supplies the winds to wing her airy way,<br/>
Where in the port secure the navy lay.<br/>
Swiftly fair Iris down her arch descends,<br/>
And, undiscern'd, her fatal voyage ends.<br/>
She saw the gath'ring crowd; and, gliding thence,<br/>
The desert shore, and fleet without defence.<br/>
The Trojan matrons, on the sands alone,<br/>
With sighs and tears Anchises' death bemoan;<br/>
Then, turning to the sea their weeping eyes,<br/>
Their pity to themselves renews their cries.<br/>
"Alas!" said one, "what oceans yet remain<br/>
For us to sail! what labours to sustain!"<br/>
All take the word, and, with a gen'ral groan,<br/>
Implore the gods for peace, and places of their own.
</p>
<p>
The goddess, great in mischief, views their pains,<br/>
And in a woman's form her heav'nly limbs restrains.<br/>
In face and shape old Beroe she became,<br/>
Doryclus' wife, a venerable dame,<br/>
Once blest with riches, and a mother's name.<br/>
Thus chang'd, amidst the crying crowd she ran,<br/>
Mix'd with the matrons, and these words began:<br/>
"O wretched we, whom not the Grecian pow'r,<br/>
Nor flames, destroy'd, in Troy's unhappy hour!<br/>
O wretched we, reserv'd by cruel fate,<br/>
Beyond the ruins of the sinking state!<br/>
Now sev'n revolving years are wholly run,<br/>
Since this improsp'rous voyage we begun;<br/>
Since, toss'd from shores to shores, from lands to lands,<br/>
Inhospitable rocks and barren sands,<br/>
Wand'ring in exile thro' the stormy sea,<br/>
We search in vain for flying Italy.<br/>
Now cast by fortune on this kindred land,<br/>
What should our rest and rising walls withstand,<br/>
Or hinder here to fix our banish'd band?<br/>
O country lost, and gods redeem'd in vain,<br/>
If still in endless exile we remain!<br/>
Shall we no more the Trojan walls renew,<br/>
Or streams of some dissembled Simois view!<br/>
Haste, join with me, th' unhappy fleet consume!<br/>
Cassandra bids; and I declare her doom.<br/>
In sleep I saw her; she supplied my hands<br/>
(For this I more than dreamt) with flaming brands:<br/>
'With these,' said she, 'these wand'ring ships destroy:<br/>
These are your fatal seats, and this your Troy.'<br/>
Time calls you now; the precious hour employ:<br/>
Slack not the good presage, while Heav'n inspires<br/>
Our minds to dare, and gives the ready fires.<br/>
See! Neptune's altars minister their brands:<br/>
The god is pleas'd; the god supplies our hands."<br/>
Then from the pile a flaming fire she drew,<br/>
And, toss'd in air, amidst the galleys threw.
</p>
<p>
Wrapp'd in amaze, the matrons wildly stare:<br/>
Then Pyrgo, reverenc'd for her hoary hair,<br/>
Pyrgo, the nurse of Priam's num'rous race:<br/>
"No Beroe this, tho' she belies her face!<br/>
What terrors from her frowning front arise!<br/>
Behold a goddess in her ardent eyes!<br/>
What rays around her heav'nly face are seen!<br/>
Mark her majestic voice, and more than mortal mien!<br/>
Beroe but now I left, whom, pin'd with pain,<br/>
Her age and anguish from these rites detain,"<br/>
She said. The matrons, seiz'd with new amaze,<br/>
Roll their malignant eyes, and on the navy gaze.<br/>
They fear, and hope, and neither part obey:<br/>
They hope the fated land, but fear the fatal way.<br/>
The goddess, having done her task below,<br/>
Mounts up on equal wings, and bends her painted bow.<br/>
Struck with the sight, and seiz'd with rage divine,<br/>
The matrons prosecute their mad design:<br/>
They shriek aloud; they snatch, with impious hands,<br/>
The food of altars; fires and flaming brands.<br/>
Green boughs and saplings, mingled in their haste,<br/>
And smoking torches, on the ships they cast.<br/>
The flame, unstopp'd at first, more fury gains,<br/>
And Vulcan rides at large with loosen'd reins:<br/>
Triumphant to the painted sterns he soars,<br/>
And seizes, in this way, the banks and crackling oars.<br/>
Eumelus was the first the news to bear,<br/>
While yet they crowd the rural theatre.<br/>
Then, what they hear, is witness'd by their eyes:<br/>
A storm of sparkles and of flames arise.<br/>
Ascanius took th' alarm, while yet he led<br/>
His early warriors on his prancing steed,<br/>
And, spurring on, his equals soon o'erpass'd;<br/>
Nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste.<br/>
Soon as the royal youth appear'd in view,<br/>
He sent his voice before him as he flew:<br/>
"What madness moves you, matrons, to destroy<br/>
The last remainders of unhappy Troy!<br/>
Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn,<br/>
And on your friends your fatal fury turn.<br/>
Behold your own Ascanius!" While he said,<br/>
He drew his glitt'ring helmet from his head,<br/>
In which the youths to sportful arms he led.<br/>
By this, Aeneas and his train appear;<br/>
And now the women, seiz'd with shame and fear,<br/>
Dispers'd, to woods and caverns take their flight,<br/>
Abhor their actions, and avoid the light;<br/>
Their friends acknowledge, and their error find,<br/>
And shake the goddess from their alter'd mind.
</p>
<p>
Not so the raging fires their fury cease,<br/>
But, lurking in the seams, with seeming peace,<br/>
Work on their way amid the smould'ring tow,<br/>
Sure in destruction, but in motion slow.<br/>
The silent plague thro' the green timber eats,<br/>
And vomits out a tardy flame by fits.<br/>
Down to the keels, and upward to the sails,<br/>
The fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails;<br/>
Nor buckets pour'd, nor strength of human hand,<br/>
Can the victorious element withstand.
</p>
<p>
The pious hero rends his robe, and throws<br/>
To heav'n his hands, and with his hands his vows.<br/>
"O Jove," he cried, "if pray'rs can yet have place;<br/>
If thou abhorr'st not all the Dardan race;<br/>
If any spark of pity still remain;<br/>
If gods are gods, and not invok'd in vain;<br/>
Yet spare the relics of the Trojan train!<br/>
Yet from the flames our burning vessels free,<br/>
Or let thy fury fall alone on me!<br/>
At this devoted head thy thunder throw,<br/>
And send the willing sacrifice below!"
</p>
<p>
Scarce had he said, when southern storms arise:<br/>
From pole to pole the forky lightning flies;<br/>
Loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain;<br/>
Heav'n bellies downward, and descends in rain.<br/>
Whole sheets of water from the clouds are sent,<br/>
Which, hissing thro' the planks, the flames prevent,<br/>
And stop the fiery pest. Four ships alone<br/>
Burn to the waist, and for the fleet atone.
</p>
<p>
But doubtful thoughts the hero's heart divide;<br/>
If he should still in Sicily reside,<br/>
Forgetful of his fates, or tempt the main,<br/>
In hope the promis'd Italy to gain.<br/>
Then Nautes, old and wise, to whom alone<br/>
The will of Heav'n by Pallas was foreshown;<br/>
Vers'd in portents, experienc'd, and inspir'd<br/>
To tell events, and what the fates requir'd;<br/>
Thus while he stood, to neither part inclin'd,<br/>
With cheerful words reliev'd his lab'ring mind:<br/>
"O goddess-born, resign'd in ev'ry state,<br/>
With patience bear, with prudence push your fate.<br/>
By suff'ring well, our Fortune we subdue;<br/>
Fly when she frowns, and, when she calls, pursue.<br/>
Your friend Acestes is of Trojan kind;<br/>
To him disclose the secrets of your mind:<br/>
Trust in his hands your old and useless train;<br/>
Too num'rous for the ships which yet remain:<br/>
The feeble, old, indulgent of their ease,<br/>
The dames who dread the dangers of the seas,<br/>
With all the dastard crew, who dare not stand<br/>
The shock of battle with your foes by land.<br/>
Here you may build a common town for all,<br/>
And, from Acestes' name, Acesta call."<br/>
The reasons, with his friend's experience join'd,<br/>
Encourag'd much, but more disturb'd his mind.
</p>
<p>
'Twas dead of night; when to his slumb'ring eyes<br/>
His father's shade descended from the skies,<br/>
And thus he spoke: "O more than vital breath,<br/>
Lov'd while I liv'd, and dear ev'n after death;<br/>
O son, in various toils and troubles toss'd,<br/>
The King of Heav'n employs my careful ghost<br/>
On his commands: the god, who sav'd from fire<br/>
Your flaming fleet, and heard your just desire.<br/>
The wholesome counsel of your friend receive,<br/>
And here the coward train and woman leave:<br/>
The chosen youth, and those who nobly dare,<br/>
Transport, to tempt the dangers of the war.<br/>
The stern Italians will their courage try;<br/>
Rough are their manners, and their minds are high.<br/>
But first to Pluto's palace you shall go,<br/>
And seek my shade among the blest below:<br/>
For not with impious ghosts my soul remains,<br/>
Nor suffers with the damn'd perpetual pains,<br/>
But breathes the living air of soft Elysian plains.<br/>
The chaste Sibylla shall your steps convey,<br/>
And blood of offer'd victims free the way.<br/>
There shall you know what realms the gods assign,<br/>
And learn the fates and fortunes of your line.<br/>
But now, farewell! I vanish with the night,<br/>
And feel the blast of heav'n's approaching light."<br/>
He said, and mix'd with shades, and took his airy flight.<br/>
"Whither so fast?" the filial duty cried;<br/>
"And why, ah why, the wish'd embrace denied?"
</p>
<p>
He said, and rose; as holy zeal inspires,<br/>
He rakes hot embers, and renews the fires;<br/>
His country gods and Vesta then adores<br/>
With cakes and incense, and their aid implores.<br/>
Next, for his friends and royal host he sent,<br/>
Reveal'd his vision, and the gods' intent,<br/>
With his own purpose. All, without delay,<br/>
The will of Jove, and his desires obey.<br/>
They list with women each degenerate name,<br/>
Who dares not hazard life for future fame.<br/>
These they cashier: the brave remaining few,<br/>
Oars, banks, and cables, half consum'd, renew.<br/>
The prince designs a city with the plow;<br/>
The lots their sev'ral tenements allow.<br/>
This part is nam'd from Ilium, that from Troy,<br/>
And the new king ascends the throne with joy;<br/>
A chosen senate from the people draws;<br/>
Appoints the judges, and ordains the laws.<br/>
Then, on the top of Eryx, they begin<br/>
A rising temple to the Paphian queen.<br/>
Anchises, last, is honour'd as a god;<br/>
A priest is added, annual gifts bestow'd,<br/>
And groves are planted round his blest abode.<br/>
Nine days they pass in feasts, their temples crown'd;<br/>
And fumes of incense in the fanes abound.<br/>
Then from the south arose a gentle breeze<br/>
That curl'd the smoothness of the glassy seas;<br/>
The rising winds a ruffling gale afford,<br/>
And call the merry mariners aboard.
</p>
<p>
Now loud laments along the shores resound,<br/>
Of parting friends in close embraces bound.<br/>
The trembling women, the degenerate train,<br/>
Who shunn'd the frightful dangers of the main,<br/>
Ev'n those desire to sail, and take their share<br/>
Of the rough passage and the promis'd war:<br/>
Whom good Aeneas cheers, and recommends<br/>
To their new master's care his fearful friends.<br/>
On Eryx's altars three fat calves he lays;<br/>
A lamb new-fallen to the stormy seas;<br/>
Then slips his haulsers, and his anchors weighs.<br/>
High on the deck the godlike hero stands,<br/>
With olive crown'd, a charger in his hands;<br/>
Then cast the reeking entrails in the brine,<br/>
And pour'd the sacrifice of purple wine.<br/>
Fresh gales arise; with equal strokes they vie,<br/>
And brush the buxom seas, and o'er the billows fly.
</p>
<p>
Meantime the mother goddess, full of fears,<br/>
To Neptune thus address'd, with tender tears:<br/>
"The pride of Jove's imperious queen, the rage,<br/>
The malice which no suff'rings can assuage,<br/>
Compel me to these pray'rs; since neither fate,<br/>
Nor time, nor pity, can remove her hate:<br/>
Ev'n Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife;<br/>
Still vanquish'd, yet she still renews the strife.<br/>
As if 'twere little to consume the town<br/>
Which aw'd the world, and wore th' imperial crown,<br/>
She prosecutes the ghost of Troy with pains,<br/>
And gnaws, ev'n to the bones, the last remains.<br/>
Let her the causes of her hatred tell;<br/>
But you can witness its effects too well.<br/>
You saw the storm she rais'd on Libyan floods,<br/>
That mix'd the mounting billows with the clouds;<br/>
When, bribing Aeolus, she shook the main,<br/>
And mov'd rebellion in your wat'ry reign.<br/>
With fury she possess'd the Dardan dames,<br/>
To burn their fleet with execrable flames,<br/>
And forc'd Aeneas, when his ships were lost,<br/>
To leave his foll'wers on a foreign coast.<br/>
For what remains, your godhead I implore,<br/>
And trust my son to your protecting pow'r.<br/>
If neither Jove's nor Fate's decree withstand,<br/>
Secure his passage to the Latian land."
</p>
<p>
Then thus the mighty Ruler of the Main:<br/>
"What may not Venus hope from Neptune's reign?<br/>
My kingdom claims your birth; my late defence<br/>
Of your indanger'd fleet may claim your confidence.<br/>
Nor less by land than sea my deeds declare<br/>
How much your lov'd Aeneas is my care.<br/>
Thee, Xanthus, and thee, Simois, I attest.<br/>
Your Trojan troops when proud Achilles press'd,<br/>
And drove before him headlong on the plain,<br/>
And dash'd against the walls the trembling train;<br/>
When floods were fill'd with bodies of the slain;<br/>
When crimson Xanthus, doubtful of his way,<br/>
Stood up on ridges to behold the sea;<br/>
New heaps came tumbling in, and chok'd his way;<br/>
When your Aeneas fought, but fought with odds<br/>
Of force unequal, and unequal gods;<br/>
I spread a cloud before the victor's sight,<br/>
Sustain'd the vanquish'd, and secur'd his flight;<br/>
Ev'n then secur'd him, when I sought with joy<br/>
The vow'd destruction of ungrateful Troy.<br/>
My will's the same: fair goddess, fear no more,<br/>
Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore;<br/>
Their lives are giv'n; one destin'd head alone<br/>
Shall perish, and for multitudes atone."<br/>
Thus having arm'd with hopes her anxious mind,<br/>
His finny team Saturnian Neptune join'd,<br/>
Then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws,<br/>
And to the loosen'd reins permits the laws.<br/>
High on the waves his azure car he guides;<br/>
Its axles thunder, and the sea subsides,<br/>
And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides.<br/>
The tempests fly before their father's face,<br/>
Trains of inferior gods his triumph grace,<br/>
And monster whales before their master play,<br/>
And choirs of Tritons crowd the wat'ry way.<br/>
The marshal'd pow'rs in equal troops divide<br/>
To right and left; the gods his better side<br/>
Inclose, and on the worse the Nymphs and Nereids ride.

<p>
Now smiling hope, with sweet vicissitude,<br/>
Within the hero's mind his joys renew'd.<br/>
He calls to raise the masts, the sheets display;<br/>
The cheerful crew with diligence obey;<br/>
They scud before the wind, and sail in open sea.<br/>
Ahead of all the master pilot steers;<br/>
And, as he leads, the following navy veers.<br/>
The steeds of Night had travel'd half the sky,<br/>
The drowsy rowers on their benches lie,<br/>
When the soft God of Sleep, with easy flight,<br/>
Descends, and draws behind a trail of light.<br/>
Thou, Palinurus, art his destin'd prey;<br/>
To thee alone he takes his fatal way.<br/>
Dire dreams to thee, and iron sleep, he bears;<br/>
And, lighting on thy prow, the form of Phorbas wears.<br/>
Then thus the traitor god began his tale:<br/>
"The winds, my friend, inspire a pleasing gale;<br/>
The ships, without thy care, securely sail.<br/>
Now steal an hour of sweet repose; and I<br/>
Will take the rudder and thy room supply."<br/>
To whom the yawning pilot, half asleep:<br/>
"Me dost thou bid to trust the treach'rous deep,<br/>
The harlot smiles of her dissembling face,<br/>
And to her faith commit the Trojan race?<br/>
Shall I believe the Siren South again,<br/>
And, oft betray'd, not know the monster main?"<br/>
He said: his fasten'd hands the rudder keep,<br/>
And, fix'd on heav'n, his eyes repel invading sleep.<br/>
The god was wroth, and at his temples threw<br/>
A branch in Lethe dipp'd, and drunk with Stygian dew:<br/>
The pilot, vanquish'd by the pow'r divine,<br/>
Soon clos'd his swimming eyes, and lay supine.<br/>
Scarce were his limbs extended at their length,<br/>
The god, insulting with superior strength,<br/>
Fell heavy on him, plung'd him in the sea,<br/>
And, with the stern, the rudder tore away.<br/>
Headlong he fell, and, struggling in the main,<br/>
Cried out for helping hands, but cried in vain.<br/>
The victor daemon mounts obscure in air,<br/>
While the ship sails without the pilot's care.<br/>
On Neptune's faith the floating fleet relies;<br/>
But what the man forsook, the god supplies,<br/>
And o'er the dang'rous deep secure the navy flies;<br/>
Glides by the Sirens' cliffs, a shelfy coast,<br/>
Long infamous for ships and sailors lost,<br/>
And white with bones. Th' impetuous ocean roars,<br/>
And rocks rebellow from the sounding shores.<br/>
The watchful hero felt the knocks, and found<br/>
The tossing vessel sail'd on shoaly ground.<br/>
Sure of his pilot's loss, he takes himself<br/>
The helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf.<br/>
Inly he griev'd, and, groaning from the breast,<br/>
Deplor'd his death; and thus his pain express'd:<br/>
"For faith repos'd on seas, and on the flatt'ring sky,<br/>
Thy naked corpse is doom'd on shores unknown to lie."

<h1>Aeneid</h1>
<h2>by Virgil</h2>
<h3>Book VII</h3>
<p>
And thou, O matron of immortal fame,<br/>
Here dying, to the shore hast left thy name;<br/>
Cajeta still the place is call'd from thee,<br/>
The nurse of great Aeneas' infancy.<br/>
Here rest thy bones in rich Hesperia's plains;<br/>
Thy name ('tis all a ghost can have) remains.
</p>
<p>
Now, when the prince her fun'ral rites had paid,<br/>
He plow'd the Tyrrhene seas with sails display'd.<br/>
From land a gentle breeze arose by night,<br/>
Serenely shone the stars, the moon was bright,<br/>
And the sea trembled with her silver light.<br/>
Now near the shelves of Circe's shores they run,<br/>
(Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,)<br/>
A dang'rous coast: the goddess wastes her days<br/>
In joyous songs; the rocks resound her lays:<br/>
In spinning, or the loom, she spends the night,<br/>
And cedar brands supply her father's light.<br/>
From hence were heard, rebellowing to the main,<br/>
The roars of lions that refuse the chain,<br/>
The grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears,<br/>
And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors' ears.<br/>
These from their caverns, at the close of night,<br/>
Fill the sad isle with horror and affright.<br/>
Darkling they mourn their fate, whom Circe's pow'r,<br/>
(That watch'd the moon and planetary hour,)<br/>
With words and wicked herbs from humankind<br/>
Had alter'd, and in brutal shapes confin'd.<br/>
Which monsters lest the Trojans' pious host<br/>
Should bear, or touch upon th' inchanted coast,<br/>
Propitious Neptune steer'd their course by night<br/>
With rising gales that sped their happy flight.<br/>
Supplied with these, they skim the sounding shore,<br/>
And hear the swelling surges vainly roar.<br/>
Now, when the rosy morn began to rise,<br/>
And wav'd her saffron streamer thro' the skies;<br/>
When Thetis blush'd in purple not her own,<br/>
And from her face the breathing winds were blown,<br/>
A sudden silence sate upon the sea,<br/>
And sweeping oars, with struggling, urge their way.<br/>
The Trojan, from the main, beheld a wood,<br/>
Which thick with shades and a brown horror stood:<br/>
Betwixt the trees the Tiber took his course,<br/>
With whirlpools dimpled; and with downward force,<br/>
That drove the sand along, he took his way,<br/>
And roll'd his yellow billows to the sea.<br/>
About him, and above, and round the wood,<br/>
The birds that haunt the borders of his flood,<br/>
That bath'd within, or basked upon his side,<br/>
To tuneful songs their narrow throats applied.<br/>
The captain gives command; the joyful train<br/>
Glide thro' the gloomy shade, and leave the main.
</p>
<p>
Now, Erato, thy poet's mind inspire,<br/>
And fill his soul with thy celestial fire!<br/>
Relate what Latium was; her ancient kings;<br/>
Declare the past and present state of things,<br/>
When first the Trojan fleet Ausonia sought,<br/>
And how the rivals lov'd, and how they fought.<br/>
These are my theme, and how the war began,<br/>
And how concluded by the godlike man:<br/>
For I shall sing of battles, blood, and rage,<br/>
Which princes and their people did engage;<br/>
And haughty souls, that, mov'd with mutual hate,<br/>
In fighting fields pursued and found their fate;<br/>
That rous'd the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms,<br/>
And peaceful Italy involv'd in arms.<br/>
A larger scene of action is display'd;<br/>
And, rising hence, a greater work is weigh'd.
</p>
<p>
Latinus, old and mild, had long possess'd<br/>
The Latin scepter, and his people blest:<br/>
His father Faunus; a Laurentian dame<br/>
His mother; fair Marica was her name.<br/>
But Faunus came from Picus: Picus drew<br/>
His birth from Saturn, if records be true.<br/>
Thus King Latinus, in the third degree,<br/>
Had Saturn author of his family.<br/>
But this old peaceful prince, as Heav'n decreed,<br/>
Was blest with no male issue to succeed:<br/>
His sons in blooming youth were snatch'd by fate;<br/>
One only daughter heir'd the royal state.<br/>
Fir'd with her love, and with ambition led,<br/>
The neighb'ring princes court her nuptial bed.<br/>
Among the crowd, but far above the rest,<br/>
Young Turnus to the beauteous maid address'd.<br/>
Turnus, for high descent and graceful mien,<br/>
Was first, and favour'd by the Latian queen;<br/>
With him she strove to join Lavinia's hand,<br/>
But dire portents the purpos'd match withstand.
</p>
<p>
Deep in the palace, of long growth, there stood<br/>
A laurel's trunk, a venerable wood;<br/>
Where rites divine were paid; whose holy hair<br/>
Was kept and cut with superstitious care.<br/>
This plant Latinus, when his town he wall'd,<br/>
Then found, and from the tree Laurentum call'd;<br/>
And last, in honour of his new abode,<br/>
He vow'd the laurel to the laurel's god.<br/>
It happen'd once (a boding prodigy!)<br/>
A swarm of bees, that cut the liquid sky,<br/>
Unknown from whence they took their airy flight,<br/>
Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight;<br/>
There with their clasping feet together clung,<br/>
And a long cluster from the laurel hung.<br/>
An ancient augur prophesied from hence:<br/>
"Behold on Latian shores a foreign prince!<br/>
From the same parts of heav'n his navy stands,<br/>
To the same parts on earth; his army lands;<br/>
The town he conquers, and the tow'r commands."
</p>
<p>
Yet more, when fair Lavinia fed the fire<br/>
Before the gods, and stood beside her sire,<br/>
Strange to relate, the flames, involv'd in smoke<br/>
Of incense, from the sacred altar broke,<br/>
Caught her dishevel'd hair and rich attire;<br/>
Her crown and jewels crackled in the fire:<br/>
From thence the fuming trail began to spread<br/>
And lambent glories danc'd about her head.<br/>
This new portent the seer with wonder views,<br/>
Then pausing, thus his prophecy renews:<br/>
"The nymph, who scatters flaming fires around,<br/>
Shall shine with honour, shall herself be crown'd;<br/>
But, caus'd by her irrevocable fate,<br/>
War shall the country waste, and change the state."
</p>
<p>
Latinus, frighted with this dire ostent,<br/>
For counsel to his father Faunus went,<br/>
And sought the shades renown'd for prophecy<br/>
Which near Albunea's sulph'rous fountain lie.<br/>
To these the Latian and the Sabine land<br/>
Fly, when distress'd, and thence relief demand.<br/>
The priest on skins of off'rings takes his ease,<br/>
And nightly visions in his slumber sees;<br/>
A swarm of thin aerial shapes appears,<br/>
And, flutt'ring round his temples, deafs his ears:<br/>
These he consults, the future fates to know,<br/>
From pow'rs above, and from the fiends below.<br/>
Here, for the gods' advice, Latinus flies,<br/>
Off'ring a hundred sheep for sacrifice:<br/>
Their woolly fleeces, as the rites requir'd,<br/>
He laid beneath him, and to rest retir'd.<br/>
No sooner were his eyes in slumber bound,<br/>
When, from above, a more than mortal sound<br/>
Invades his ears; and thus the vision spoke:<br/>
"Seek not, my seed, in Latian bands to yoke<br/>
Our fair Lavinia, nor the gods provoke.<br/>
A foreign son upon thy shore descends,<br/>
Whose martial fame from pole to pole extends.<br/>
His race, in arms and arts of peace renown'd,<br/>
Not Latium shall contain, nor Europe bound:<br/>
'Tis theirs whate'er the sun surveys around."<br/>
These answers, in the silent night receiv'd,<br/>
The king himself divulg'd, the land believ'd:<br/>
The fame thro' all the neighb'ring nations flew,<br/>
When now the Trojan navy was in view.
</p>
<p>
Beneath a shady tree, the hero spread<br/>
His table on the turf, with cakes of bread;<br/>
And, with his chiefs, on forest fruits he fed.<br/>
They sate; and, (not without the god's command,)<br/>
Their homely fare dispatch'd, the hungry band<br/>
Invade their trenchers next, and soon devour,<br/>
To mend the scanty meal, their cakes of flour.<br/>
Ascanius this observ'd, and smiling said:<br/>
"See, we devour the plates on which we fed."<br/>
The speech had omen, that the Trojan race<br/>
Should find repose, and this the time and place.<br/>
Aeneas took the word, and thus replies,<br/>
Confessing fate with wonder in his eyes:<br/>
"All hail, O earth! all hail, my household gods!<br/>
Behold the destin'd place of your abodes!<br/>
For thus Anchises prophesied of old,<br/>
And this our fatal place of rest foretold:<br/>
'When, on a foreign shore, instead of meat,<br/>
By famine forc'd, your trenchers you shall eat,<br/>
Then ease your weary Trojans will attend,<br/>
And the long labours of your voyage end.<br/>
Remember on that happy coast to build,<br/>
And with a trench inclose the fruitful field.'<br/>
This was that famine, this the fatal place<br/>
Which ends the wand'ring of our exil'd race.<br/>
Then, on tomorrow's dawn, your care employ,<br/>
To search the land, and where the cities lie,<br/>
And what the men; but give this day to joy.<br/>
Now pour to Jove; and, after Jove is blest,<br/>
Call great Anchises to the genial feast:<br/>
Crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught;<br/>
Enjoy the present hour; adjourn the future thought."
</p>
<p>
Thus having said, the hero bound his brows<br/>
With leafy branches, then perform'd his vows;<br/>
Adoring first the genius of the place,<br/>
Then Earth, the mother of the heav'nly race,<br/>
The nymphs, and native godheads yet unknown,<br/>
And Night, and all the stars that gild her sable throne,<br/>
And ancient Cybel, and Idaean Jove,<br/>
And last his sire below, and mother queen above.<br/>
Then heav'n's high monarch thunder'd thrice aloud,<br/>
And thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud.<br/>
Soon thro' the joyful camp a rumour flew,<br/>
The time was come their city to renew.<br/>
Then ev'ry brow with cheerful green is crown'd,<br/>
The feasts are doubled, and the bowls go round.
</p>
<p>
When next the rosy morn disclos'd the day,<br/>
The scouts to sev'ral parts divide their way,<br/>
To learn the natives' names, their towns explore,<br/>
The coasts and trendings of the crooked shore:<br/>
Here Tiber flows, and here Numicus stands;<br/>
Here warlike Latins hold the happy lands.<br/>
The pious chief, who sought by peaceful ways<br/>
To found his empire, and his town to raise,<br/>
A hundred youths from all his train selects,<br/>
And to the Latian court their course directs,<br/>
(The spacious palace where their prince resides,)<br/>
And all their heads with wreaths of olive hides.<br/>
They go commission'd to require a peace,<br/>
And carry presents to procure access.<br/>
Thus while they speed their pace, the prince designs<br/>
His new-elected seat, and draws the lines.<br/>
The Trojans round the place a rampire cast,<br/>
And palisades about the trenches plac'd.
</p>
<p>
Meantime the train, proceeding on their way,<br/>
From far the town and lofty tow'rs survey;<br/>
At length approach the walls. Without the gate,<br/>
They see the boys and Latian youth debate<br/>
The martial prizes on the dusty plain:<br/>
Some drive the cars, and some the coursers rein;<br/>
Some bend the stubborn bow for victory,<br/>
And some with darts their active sinews try.<br/>
A posting messenger, dispatch'd from hence,<br/>
Of this fair troop advis'd their aged prince,<br/>
That foreign men of mighty stature came;<br/>
Uncouth their habit, and unknown their name.<br/>
The king ordains their entrance, and ascends<br/>
His regal seat, surrounded by his friends.
</p>
<p>
The palace built by Picus, vast and proud,<br/>
Supported by a hundred pillars stood,<br/>
And round incompass'd with a rising wood.<br/>
The pile o'erlook'd the town, and drew the sight;<br/>
Surpris'd at once with reverence and delight.<br/>
There kings receiv'd the marks of sov'reign pow'r;<br/>
In state the monarchs march'd; the lictors bore<br/>
Their awful axes and the rods before.<br/>
Here the tribunal stood, the house of pray'r,<br/>
And here the sacred senators repair;<br/>
All at large tables, in long order set,<br/>
A ram their off'ring, and a ram their meat.<br/>
Above the portal, carv'd in cedar wood,<br/>
Plac'd in their ranks, their godlike grandsires stood;<br/>
Old Saturn, with his crooked scythe, on high;<br/>
And Italus, that led the colony;<br/>
And ancient Janus, with his double face,<br/>
And bunch of keys, the porter of the place.<br/>
There good Sabinus, planter of the vines,<br/>
On a short pruning hook his head reclines,<br/>
And studiously surveys his gen'rous wines;<br/>
Then warlike kings, who for their country fought,<br/>
And honourable wounds from battle brought.<br/>
Around the posts hung helmets, darts, and spears,<br/>
And captive chariots, axes, shields, and bars,<br/>
And broken beaks of ships, the trophies of their wars.<br/>
Above the rest, as chief of all the band,<br/>
Was Picus plac'd, a buckler in his hand;<br/>
His other wav'd a long divining wand.<br/>
Girt in his Gabin gown the hero sate,<br/>
Yet could not with his art avoid his fate:<br/>
For Circe long had lov'd the youth in vain,<br/>
Till love, refus'd, converted to disdain:<br/>
Then, mixing pow'rful herbs, with magic art,<br/>
She chang'd his form, who could not change his heart;<br/>
Constrain'd him in a bird, and made him fly,<br/>
With party-colour'd plumes, a chatt'ring pie.
</p>
<p>
In this high temple, on a chair of state,<br/>
The seat of audience, old Latinus sate;<br/>
Then gave admission to the Trojan train;<br/>
And thus with pleasing accents he began:<br/>
"Tell me, ye Trojans, for that name you own,<br/>
Nor is your course upon our coasts unknown;<br/>
Say what you seek, and whither were you bound:<br/>
Were you by stress of weather cast aground?<br/>
Such dangers as on seas are often seen,<br/>
And oft befall to miserable men,<br/>
Or come, your shipping in our ports to lay,<br/>
Spent and disabled in so long a way?<br/>
Say what you want: the Latians you shall find<br/>
Not forc'd to goodness, but by will inclin'd;<br/>
For, since the time of Saturn's holy reign,<br/>
His hospitable customs we retain.<br/>
I call to mind (but time the tale has worn)<br/>
Th' Arunci told, that Dardanus, tho' born<br/>
On Latian plains, yet sought the Phrygian shore,<br/>
And Samothracia, Samos call'd before.<br/>
From Tuscan Coritum he claim'd his birth;<br/>
But after, when exempt from mortal earth,<br/>
From thence ascended to his kindred skies,<br/>
A god, and, as a god, augments their sacrifice."
</p>
<p>
He said. Ilioneus made this reply:<br/>
"O king, of Faunus' royal family!<br/>
Nor wintry winds to Latium forc'd our way,<br/>
Nor did the stars our wand'ring course betray.<br/>
Willing we sought your shores; and, hither bound,<br/>
The port, so long desir'd, at length we found;<br/>
From our sweet homes and ancient realms expell'd;<br/>
Great as the greatest that the sun beheld.<br/>
The god began our line, who rules above;<br/>
And, as our race, our king descends from Jove:<br/>
And hither are we come, by his command,<br/>
To crave admission in your happy land.<br/>
How dire a tempest, from Mycenae pour'd,<br/>
Our plains, our temples, and our town devour'd;<br/>
What was the waste of war, what fierce alarms<br/>
Shook Asia's crown with European arms;<br/>
Ev'n such have heard, if any such there be,<br/>
Whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea;<br/>
And such as, born beneath the burning sky<br/>
And sultry sun, betwixt the tropics lie.<br/>
From that dire deluge, thro' the wat'ry waste,<br/>
Such length of years, such various perils past,<br/>
At last escap'd, to Latium we repair,<br/>
To beg what you without your want may spare:<br/>
The common water, and the common air;<br/>
Sheds which ourselves will build, and mean abodes,<br/>
Fit to receive and serve our banish'd gods.<br/>
Nor our admission shall your realm disgrace,<br/>
Nor length of time our gratitude efface.<br/>
Besides, what endless honour you shall gain,<br/>
To save and shelter Troy's unhappy train!<br/>
Now, by my sov'reign, and his fate, I swear,<br/>
Renown'd for faith in peace, for force in war;<br/>
Oft our alliance other lands desir'd,<br/>
And, what we seek of you, of us requir'd.<br/>
Despite not then, that in our hands we bear<br/>
These holy boughs, and sue with words of pray'r.<br/>
Fate and the gods, by their supreme command,<br/>
Have doom'd our ships to seek the Latian land.<br/>
To these abodes our fleet Apollo sends;<br/>
Here Dardanus was born, and hither tends;<br/>
Where Tuscan Tiber rolls with rapid force,<br/>
And where Numicus opes his holy source.<br/>
Besides, our prince presents, with his request,<br/>
Some small remains of what his sire possess'd.<br/>
This golden charger, snatch'd from burning Troy,<br/>
Anchises did in sacrifice employ;<br/>
This royal robe and this tiara wore<br/>
Old Priam, and this golden scepter bore<br/>
In full assemblies, and in solemn games;<br/>
These purple vests were weav'd by Dardan dames."
</p>
<p>
Thus while he spoke, Latinus roll'd around<br/>
His eyes, and fix'd a while upon the ground.<br/>
Intent he seem'd, and anxious in his breast;<br/>
Not by the scepter mov'd, or kingly vest,<br/>
But pond'ring future things of wondrous weight;<br/>
Succession, empire, and his daughter's fate.<br/>
On these he mus'd within his thoughtful mind,<br/>
And then revolv'd what Faunus had divin'd.<br/>
This was the foreign prince, by fate decreed<br/>
To share his scepter, and Lavinia's bed;<br/>
This was the race that sure portents foreshew<br/>
To sway the world, and land and sea subdue.<br/>
At length he rais'd his cheerful head, and spoke:<br/>
"The pow'rs," said he, "the pow'rs we both invoke,<br/>
To you, and yours, and mine, propitious be,<br/>
And firm our purpose with their augury!<br/>
Have what you ask; your presents I receive;<br/>
Land, where and when you please, with ample leave;<br/>
Partake and use my kingdom as your own;<br/>
All shall be yours, while I command the crown:<br/>
And, if my wish'd alliance please your king,<br/>
Tell him he should not send the peace, but bring.<br/>
Then let him not a friend's embraces fear;<br/>
The peace is made when I behold him here.<br/>
Besides this answer, tell my royal guest,<br/>
I add to his commands my own request:<br/>
One only daughter heirs my crown and state,<br/>
Whom not our oracles, nor Heav'n, nor fate,<br/>
Nor frequent prodigies, permit to join<br/>
With any native of th' Ausonian line.<br/>
A foreign son-in-law shall come from far<br/>
(Such is our doom), a chief renown'd in war,<br/>
Whose race shall bear aloft the Latian name,<br/>
And thro' the conquer'd world diffuse our fame.<br/>
Himself to be the man the fates require,<br/>
I firmly judge, and, what I judge, desire."
</p>
<p>
He said, and then on each bestow'd a steed.<br/>
Three hundred horses, in high stables fed,<br/>
Stood ready, shining all, and smoothly dress'd:<br/>
Of these he chose the fairest and the best,<br/>
To mount the Trojan troop. At his command<br/>
The steeds caparison'd with purple stand,<br/>
With golden trappings, glorious to behold,<br/>
And champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold.<br/>
Then to his absent guest the king decreed<br/>
A pair of coursers born of heav'nly breed,<br/>
Who from their nostrils breath'd ethereal fire;<br/>
Whom Circe stole from her celestial sire,<br/>
By substituting mares produc'd on earth,<br/>
Whose wombs conceiv'd a more than mortal birth.<br/>
These draw the chariot which Latinus sends,<br/>
And the rich present to the prince commends.<br/>
Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne,<br/>
To their expecting lord with peace return.
</p>
<p>
But jealous Juno, from Pachynus' height,<br/>
As she from Argos took her airy flight,<br/>
Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight.<br/>
She saw the Trojan and his joyful train<br/>
Descend upon the shore, desert the main,<br/>
Design a town, and, with unhop'd success,<br/>
Th' embassadors return with promis'd peace.<br/>
Then, pierc'd with pain, she shook her haughty head,<br/>
Sigh'd from her inward soul, and thus she said:<br/>
"O hated offspring of my Phrygian foes!<br/>
O fates of Troy, which Juno's fates oppose!<br/>
Could they not fall unpitied on the plain,<br/>
But slain revive, and, taken, scape again?<br/>
When execrable Troy in ashes lay,<br/>
Thro' fires and swords and seas they forc'd their way.<br/>
Then vanquish'd Juno must in vain contend,<br/>
Her rage disarm'd, her empire at an end.<br/>
Breathless and tir'd, is all my fury spent?<br/>
Or does my glutted spleen at length relent?<br/>
As if 'twere little from their town to chase,<br/>
I thro' the seas pursued their exil'd race;<br/>
Ingag'd the heav'ns, oppos'd the stormy main;<br/>
But billows roar'd, and tempests rag'd in vain.<br/>
What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done,<br/>
When these they overpass, and those they shun?<br/>
On Tiber's shores they land, secure of fate,<br/>
Triumphant o'er the storms and Juno's hate.<br/>
Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe,<br/>
And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia's wrath,<br/>
Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon;<br/>
What great offence had either people done?<br/>
But I, the consort of the Thunderer,<br/>
Have wag'd a long and unsuccessful war,<br/>
With various arts and arms in vain have toil'd,<br/>
And by a mortal man at length am foil'd.<br/>
If native pow'r prevail not, shall I doubt<br/>
To seek for needful succour from without?<br/>
If Jove and Heav'n my just desires deny,<br/>
Hell shall the pow'r of Heav'n and Jove supply.<br/>
Grant that the Fates have firm'd, by their decree,<br/>
The Trojan race to reign in Italy;<br/>
At least I can defer the nuptial day,<br/>
And with protracted wars the peace delay:<br/>
With blood the dear alliance shall be bought,<br/>
And both the people near destruction brought;<br/>
So shall the son-in-law and father join,<br/>
With ruin, war, and waste of either line.<br/>
O fatal maid, thy marriage is endow'd<br/>
With Phrygian, Latian, and Rutulian blood!<br/>
Bellona leads thee to thy lover's hand;<br/>
Another queen brings forth another brand,<br/>
To burn with foreign fires another land!<br/>
A second Paris, diff'ring but in name,<br/>
Shall fire his country with a second flame."
</p>
<p>
Thus having said, she sinks beneath the ground,<br/>
With furious haste, and shoots the Stygian sound,<br/>
To rouse Alecto from th' infernal seat<br/>
Of her dire sisters, and their dark retreat.<br/>
This Fury, fit for her intent, she chose;<br/>
One who delights in wars and human woes.<br/>
Ev'n Pluto hates his own misshapen race;<br/>
Her sister Furies fly her hideous face;<br/>
So frightful are the forms the monster takes,<br/>
So fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes.<br/>
Her Juno finds, and thus inflames her spite:<br/>
"O virgin daughter of eternal Night,<br/>
Give me this once thy labour, to sustain<br/>
My right, and execute my just disdain.<br/>
Let not the Trojans, with a feign'd pretence<br/>
Of proffer'd peace, delude the Latian prince.<br/>
Expel from Italy that odious name,<br/>
And let not Juno suffer in her fame.<br/>
'Tis thine to ruin realms, o'erturn a state,<br/>
Betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate,<br/>
And kindle kindred blood to mutual hate.<br/>
Thy hand o'er towns the fun'ral torch displays,<br/>
And forms a thousand ills ten thousand ways.<br/>
Now shake, out thy fruitful breast, the seeds<br/>
Of envy, discord, and of cruel deeds:<br/>
Confound the peace establish'd, and prepare<br/>
Their souls to hatred, and their hands to war."
</p>
<p>
Smear'd as she was with black Gorgonian blood,<br/>
The Fury sprang above the Stygian flood;<br/>
And on her wicker wings, sublime thro' night,<br/>
She to the Latian palace took her flight:<br/>
There sought the queen's apartment, stood before<br/>
The peaceful threshold, and besieg'd the door.<br/>
Restless Amata lay, her swelling breast<br/>
Fir'd with disdain for Turnus dispossess'd,<br/>
And the new nuptials of the Trojan guest.<br/>
From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes<br/>
Her darling plague, the fav'rite of her snakes;<br/>
With her full force she threw the poisonous dart,<br/>
And fix'd it deep within Amata's heart,<br/>
That, thus envenom'd, she might kindle rage,<br/>
And sacrifice to strife her house and husband's age.<br/>
Unseen, unfelt, the fiery serpent skims<br/>
Betwixt her linen and her naked limbs;<br/>
His baleful breath inspiring, as he glides,<br/>
Now like a chain around her neck he rides,<br/>
Now like a fillet to her head repairs,<br/>
And with his circling volumes folds her hairs.<br/>
At first the silent venom slid with ease,<br/>
And seiz'd her cooler senses by degrees;<br/>
Then, ere th' infected mass was fir'd too far,<br/>
In plaintive accents she began the war,<br/>
And thus bespoke her husband: "Shall," she said,<br/>
"A wand'ring prince enjoy Lavinia's bed?<br/>
If nature plead not in a parent's heart,<br/>
Pity my tears, and pity her desert.<br/>
I know, my dearest lord, the time will come,<br/>
You'd in vain, reverse your cruel doom;<br/>
The faithless pirate soon will set to sea,<br/>
And bear the royal virgin far away!<br/>
A guest like him, a Trojan guest before,<br/>
In shew of friendship sought the Spartan shore,<br/>
And ravish'd Helen from her husband bore.<br/>
Think on a king's inviolable word;<br/>
And think on Turnus, her once plighted lord:<br/>
To this false foreigner you give your throne,<br/>
And wrong a friend, a kinsman, and a son.<br/>
Resume your ancient care; and, if the god<br/>
Your sire, and you, resolve on foreign blood,<br/>
Know all are foreign, in a larger sense,<br/>
Not born your subjects, or deriv'd from hence.<br/>
Then, if the line of Turnus you retrace,<br/>
He springs from Inachus of Argive race."
</p>
<p>
But when she saw her reasons idly spent,<br/>
And could not move him from his fix'd intent,<br/>
She flew to rage; for now the snake possess'd<br/>
Her vital parts, and poison'd all her breast;<br/>
She raves, she runs with a distracted pace,<br/>
And fills with horrid howls the public place.<br/>
And, as young striplings whip the top for sport,<br/>
On the smooth pavement of an empty court;<br/>
The wooden engine flies and whirls about,<br/>
Admir'd, with clamours, of the beardless rout;<br/>
They lash aloud; each other they provoke,<br/>
And lend their little souls at ev'ry stroke:<br/>
Thus fares the queen; and thus her fury blows<br/>
Amidst the crowd, and kindles as she goes.<br/>
Nor yet content, she strains her malice more,<br/>
And adds new ills to those contriv'd before:<br/>
She flies the town, and, mixing with a throng<br/>
Of madding matrons, bears the bride along,<br/>
Wand'ring thro' woods and wilds, and devious ways,<br/>
And with these arts the Trojan match delays.<br/>
She feign'd the rites of Bacchus; cried aloud,<br/>
And to the buxom god the virgin vow'd.<br/>
"Evoe! O Bacchus!" thus began the song;<br/>
And "Evoe!" answer'd all the female throng.<br/>
"O virgin! worthy thee alone!" she cried;<br/>
"O worthy thee alone!" the crew replied.<br/>
"For thee she feeds her hair, she leads thy dance,<br/>
And with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance."<br/>
Like fury seiz'd the rest; the progress known,<br/>
All seek the mountains, and forsake the town:<br/>
All, clad in skins of beasts, the jav'lin bear,<br/>
Give to the wanton winds their flowing hair,<br/>
And shrieks and shoutings rend the suff'ring air.<br/>
The queen herself, inspir'd with rage divine,<br/>
Shook high above her head a flaming pine;<br/>
Then roll'd her haggard eyes around the throng,<br/>
And sung, in Turnus' name, the nuptial song:<br/>
"Io, ye Latian dames! if any here<br/>
Hold your unhappy queen, Amata, dear;<br/>
If there be here," she said, "who dare maintain<br/>
My right, nor think the name of mother vain;<br/>
Unbind your fillets, loose your flowing hair,<br/>
And orgies and nocturnal rites prepare."
</p>
<p>
Amata's breast the Fury thus invades,<br/>
And fires with rage, amid the sylvan shades;<br/>
Then, when she found her venom spread so far,<br/>
The royal house embroil'd in civil war,<br/>
Rais'd on her dusky wings, she cleaves the skies,<br/>
And seeks the palace where young Turnus lies.<br/>
His town, as fame reports, was built of old<br/>
By Danae, pregnant with almighty gold,<br/>
Who fled her father's rage, and, with a train<br/>
Of following Argives, thro' the stormy main,<br/>
Driv'n by the southern blasts, was fated here to reign.<br/>
'Twas Ardua once; now Ardea's name it bears;<br/>
Once a fair city, now consum'd with years.<br/>
Here, in his lofty palace, Turnus lay,<br/>
Betwixt the confines of the night and day,<br/>
Secure in sleep. The Fury laid aside<br/>
Her looks and limbs, and with new methods tried<br/>
The foulness of th' infernal form to hide.<br/>
Propp'd on a staff, she takes a trembling mien:<br/>
Her face is furrow'd, and her front obscene;<br/>
Deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws;<br/>
Sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws;<br/>
Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound,<br/>
Her temples with an olive wreath are crown'd.<br/>
Old Chalybe, who kept the sacred fane<br/>
Of Juno, now she seem'd, and thus began,<br/>
Appearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man:<br/>
"Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain<br/>
In fighting fields, and conquer towns in vain?<br/>
Win, for a Trojan head to wear the prize,<br/>
Usurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories?<br/>
The bride and scepter which thy blood has bought,<br/>
The king transfers; and foreign heirs are sought.<br/>
Go now, deluded man, and seek again<br/>
New toils, new dangers, on the dusty plain.<br/>
Repel the Tuscan foes; their city seize;<br/>
Protect the Latians in luxurious ease.<br/>
This dream all-pow'rful Juno sends; I bear<br/>
Her mighty mandates, and her words you hear.<br/>
Haste; arm your Ardeans; issue to the plain;<br/>
With fate to friend, assault the Trojan train:<br/>
Their thoughtless chiefs, their painted ships, that lie<br/>
In Tiber's mouth, with fire and sword destroy.<br/>
The Latian king, unless he shall submit,<br/>
Own his old promise, and his new forget;<br/>
Let him, in arms, the pow'r of Turnus prove,<br/>
And learn to fear whom he disdains to love.<br/>
For such is Heav'n's command." The youthful prince<br/>
With scorn replied, and made this bold defence:<br/>
"You tell me, mother, what I knew before:<br/>
The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore.<br/>
I neither fear nor will provoke the war;<br/>
My fate is Juno's most peculiar care.<br/>
But time has made you dote, and vainly tell<br/>
Of arms imagin'd in your lonely cell.<br/>
Go; be the temple and the gods your care;<br/>
Permit to men the thought of peace and war."
</p>
<p>
These haughty words Alecto's rage provoke,<br/>
And frighted Turnus trembled as she spoke.<br/>
Her eyes grow stiffen'd, and with sulphur burn;<br/>
Her hideous looks and hellish form return;<br/>
Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place,<br/>
And open all the furies of her face:<br/>
Then, darting fire from her malignant eyes,<br/>
She cast him backward as he strove to rise,<br/>
And, ling'ring, sought to frame some new replies.<br/>
High on her head she rears two twisted snakes,<br/>
Her chains she rattles, and her whip she shakes;<br/>
And, churning bloody foam, thus loudly speaks:<br/>
"Behold whom time has made to dote, and tell<br/>
Of arms imagin'd in her lonely cell!<br/>
Behold the Fates' infernal minister!<br/>
War, death, destruction, in my hand I bear."
</p>
<p>
Thus having said, her smould'ring torch, impress'd<br/>
With her full force, she plung'd into his breast.<br/>
Aghast he wak'd; and, starting from his bed,<br/>
Cold sweat, in clammy drops, his limbs o'erspread.<br/>
"Arms! arms!" he cries: "my sword and shield prepare!"<br/>
He breathes defiance, blood, and mortal war.<br/>
So, when with crackling flames a caldron fries,<br/>
The bubbling waters from the bottom rise:<br/>
Above the brims they force their fiery way;<br/>
Black vapours climb aloft, and cloud the day.
</p>
<p>
The peace polluted thus, a chosen band<br/>
He first commissions to the Latian land,<br/>
In threat'ning embassy; then rais'd the rest,<br/>
To meet in arms th' intruding Trojan guest,<br/>
To force the foes from the Lavinian shore,<br/>
And Italy's indanger'd peace restore.<br/>
Himself alone an equal match he boasts,<br/>
To fight the Phrygian and Ausonian hosts.<br/>
The gods invok'd, the Rutuli prepare<br/>
Their arms, and warn each other to the war.<br/>
His beauty these, and those his blooming age,<br/>
The rest his house and his own fame engage.
</p>
<p>
While Turnus urges thus his enterprise,<br/>
The Stygian Fury to the Trojans flies;<br/>
New frauds invents, and takes a steepy stand,<br/>
Which overlooks the vale with wide command;<br/>
Where fair Ascanius and his youthful train,<br/>
With horns and hounds, a hunting match ordain,<br/>
And pitch their toils around the shady plain.<br/>
The Fury fires the pack; they snuff, they vent,<br/>
And feed their hungry nostrils with the scent.<br/>
'Twas of a well-grown stag, whose antlers rise<br/>
High o'er his front; his beams invade the skies.<br/>
From this light cause th' infernal maid prepares<br/>
The country churls to mischief, hate, and wars.
</p>
<p>
The stately beast the two Tyrrhidae bred,<br/>
Snatch'd from his dams, and the tame youngling fed.<br/>
Their father Tyrrheus did his fodder bring,<br/>
Tyrrheus, chief ranger to the Latian king:<br/>
Their sister Silvia cherish'd with her care<br/>
The little wanton, and did wreaths prepare<br/>
To hang his budding horns, with ribbons tied<br/>
His tender neck, and comb'd his silken hide,<br/>
And bathed his body. Patient of command<br/>
In time he grew, and, growing us'd to hand,<br/>
He waited at his master's board for food;<br/>
Then sought his salvage kindred in the wood,<br/>
Where grazing all the day, at night he came<br/>
To his known lodgings, and his country dame.
</p>
<p>
This household beast, that us'd the woodland grounds,<br/>
Was view'd at first by the young hero's hounds,<br/>
As down the stream he swam, to seek retreat<br/>
In the cool waters, and to quench his heat.<br/>
Ascanius young, and eager of his game,<br/>
Soon bent his bow, uncertain in his aim;<br/>
But the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides,<br/>
Which pierc'd his bowels thro' his panting sides.<br/>
The bleeding creature issues from the floods,<br/>
Possess'd with fear, and seeks his known abodes,<br/>
His old familiar hearth and household gods.<br/>
He falls; he fills the house with heavy groans,<br/>
Implores their pity, and his pain bemoans.<br/>
Young Silvia beats her breast, and cries aloud<br/>
For succour from the clownish neighbourhood:<br/>
The churls assemble; for the fiend, who lay<br/>
In the close woody covert, urg'd their way.<br/>
One with a brand yet burning from the flame,<br/>
Arm'd with a knotty club another came:<br/>
Whate'er they catch or find, without their care,<br/>
Their fury makes an instrument of war.<br/>
Tyrrheus, the foster father of the beast,<br/>
Then clench'd a hatchet in his horny fist,<br/>
But held his hand from the descending stroke,<br/>
And left his wedge within the cloven oak,<br/>
To whet their courage and their rage provoke.<br/>
And now the goddess, exercis'd in ill,<br/>
Who watch'd an hour to work her impious will,<br/>
Ascends the roof, and to her crooked horn,<br/>
Such as was then by Latian shepherds borne,<br/>
Adds all her breath: the rocks and woods around,<br/>
And mountains, tremble at th' infernal sound.<br/>
The sacred lake of Trivia from afar,<br/>
The Veline fountains, and sulphureous Nar,<br/>
Shake at the baleful blast, the signal of the war.<br/>
Young mothers wildly stare, with fear possess'd,<br/>
And strain their helpless infants to their breast.
</p>
<p>
The clowns, a boist'rous, rude, ungovern'd crew,<br/>
With furious haste to the loud summons flew.<br/>
The pow'rs of Troy, then issuing on the plain,<br/>
With fresh recruits their youthful chief sustain:<br/>
Not theirs a raw and unexperienc'd train,<br/>
But a firm body of embattled men.<br/>
At first, while fortune favour'd neither side,<br/>
The fight with clubs and burning brands was tried;<br/>
But now, both parties reinforc'd, the fields<br/>
Are bright with flaming swords and brazen shields.<br/>
A shining harvest either host displays,<br/>
And shoots against the sun with equal rays.<br/>
Thus, when a black-brow'd gust begins to rise,<br/>
White foam at first on the curl'd ocean fries;<br/>
Then roars the main, the billows mount the skies;<br/>
Till, by the fury of the storm full blown,<br/>
The muddy bottom o'er the clouds is thrown.<br/>
First Almon falls, old Tyrrheus' eldest care,<br/>
Pierc'd with an arrow from the distant war:<br/>
Fix'd in his throat the flying weapon stood,<br/>
And stopp'd his breath, and drank his vital blood<br/>
Huge heaps of slain around the body rise:<br/>
Among the rest, the rich Galesus lies;<br/>
A good old man, while peace he preach'd in vain,<br/>
Amidst the madness of th' unruly train:<br/>
Five herds, five bleating flocks, his pastures fill'd;<br/>
His lands a hundred yoke of oxen till'd.
</p>
<p>
Thus, while in equal scales their fortune stood<br/>
The Fury bath'd them in each other's blood;<br/>
Then, having fix'd the fight, exulting flies,<br/>
And bears fulfill'd her promise to the skies.<br/>
To Juno thus she speaks: "Behold! It is done,<br/>
The blood already drawn, the war begun;<br/>
The discord is complete; nor can they cease<br/>
The dire debate, nor you command the peace.<br/>
Now, since the Latian and the Trojan brood<br/>
Have tasted vengeance and the sweets of blood;<br/>
Speak, and my pow'r shall add this office more:<br/>
The neighbr'ing nations of th' Ausonian shore<br/>
Shall hear the dreadful rumour, from afar,<br/>
Of arm'd invasion, and embrace the war."<br/>
Then Juno thus: "The grateful work is done,<br/>
The seeds of discord sow'd, the war begun;<br/>
Frauds, fears, and fury have possess'd the state,<br/>
And fix'd the causes of a lasting hate.<br/>
A bloody Hymen shall th' alliance join<br/>
Betwixt the Trojan and Ausonian line:<br/>
But thou with speed to night and hell repair;<br/>
For not the gods, nor angry Jove, will bear<br/>
Thy lawless wand'ring walks in upper air.<br/>
Leave what remains to me." Saturnia said:<br/>
The sullen fiend her sounding wings display'd,<br/>
Unwilling left the light, and sought the nether shade.
</p>
<p>
In midst of Italy, well known to fame,<br/>
There lies a lake, Amsanctus is the name,<br/>
Below the lofty mounts: on either side<br/>
Thick forests the forbidden entrance hide.<br/>
Full in the centre of the sacred wood<br/>
An arm arises of the Stygian flood,<br/>
Which, breaking from beneath with bellowing sound,<br/>
Whirls the black waves and rattling stones around.<br/>
Here Pluto pants for breath from out his cell,<br/>
And opens wide the grinning jaws of hell.<br/>
To this infernal lake the Fury flies;<br/>
Here hides her hated head, and frees the lab'ring skies.
</p>
<p>
Saturnian Juno now, with double care,<br/>
Attends the fatal process of the war.<br/>
The clowns, return'd, from battle bear the slain,<br/>
Implore the gods, and to their king complain.<br/>
The corps of Almon and the rest are shown;<br/>
Shrieks, clamours, murmurs, fill the frighted town.<br/>
Ambitious Turnus in the press appears,<br/>
And, aggravating crimes, augments their fears;<br/>
Proclaims his private injuries aloud,<br/>
A solemn promise made, and disavow'd;<br/>
A foreign son is sought, and a mix'd mungril brood.<br/>
Then they, whose mothers, frantic with their fear,<br/>
In woods and wilds the flags of Bacchus bear,<br/>
And lead his dances with dishevel'd hair,<br/>
Increase the clamour, and the war demand,<br/>
(Such was Amata's int'rest in the land,)<br/>
Against the public sanctions of the peace,<br/>
Against all omens of their ill success.<br/>
With fates averse, the rout in arms resort,<br/>
To force their monarch, and insult the court.<br/>
But, like a rock unmov'd, a rock that braves<br/>
The raging tempest and the rising waves,<br/>
Propp'd on himself he stands; his solid sides<br/>
Wash off the seaweeds, and the sounding tides:<br/>
So stood the pious prince, unmov'd, and long<br/>
Sustain'd the madness of the noisy throng.<br/>
But, when he found that Juno's pow'r prevail'd,<br/>
And all the methods of cool counsel fail'd,<br/>
He calls the gods to witness their offence,<br/>
Disclaims the war, asserts his innocence.<br/>
"Hurried by fate," he cries, "and borne before<br/>
A furious wind, we have the faithful shore.<br/>
O more than madmen! you yourselves shall bear<br/>
The guilt of blood and sacrilegious war:<br/>
Thou, Turnus, shalt atone it by thy fate,<br/>
And pray to Heav'n for peace, but pray too late.<br/>
For me, my stormy voyage at an end,<br/>
I to the port of death securely tend.<br/>
The fun'ral pomp which to your kings you pay,<br/>
Is all I want, and all you take away."<br/>
He said no more, but, in his walls confin'd,<br/>
Shut out the woes which he too well divin'd<br/>
Nor with the rising storm would vainly strive,<br/>
But left the helm, and let the vessel drive.
</p>
<p>
A solemn custom was observ'd of old,<br/>
Which Latium held, and now the Romans hold,<br/>
Their standard when in fighting fields they rear<br/>
Against the fierce Hyrcanians, or declare<br/>
The Scythian, Indian, or Arabian war;<br/>
Or from the boasting Parthians would regain<br/>
Their eagles, lost in Carrhae's bloody plain.<br/>
Two gates of steel (the name of Mars they bear,<br/>
And still are worship'd with religious fear)<br/>
Before his temple stand: the dire abode,<br/>
And the fear'd issues of the furious god,<br/>
Are fenc'd with brazen bolts; without the gates,<br/>
The wary guardian Janus doubly waits.<br/>
Then, when the sacred senate votes the wars,<br/>
The Roman consul their decree declares,<br/>
And in his robes the sounding gates unbars.<br/>
The youth in military shouts arise,<br/>
And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies.<br/>
These rites, of old by sov'reign princes us'd,<br/>
Were the king's office; but the king refus'd,<br/>
Deaf to their cries, nor would the gates unbar<br/>
Of sacred peace, or loose th' imprison'd war;<br/>
But hid his head, and, safe from loud alarms,<br/>
Abhorr'd the wicked ministry of arms.<br/>
Then heav'n's imperious queen shot down from high:<br/>
At her approach the brazen hinges fly;<br/>
The gates are forc'd, and ev'ry falling bar;<br/>
And, like a tempest, issues out the war.
</p>
<p>
The peaceful cities of th' Ausonian shore,<br/>
Lull'd in their ease, and undisturb'd before,<br/>
Are all on fire; and some, with studious care,<br/>
Their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare;<br/>
Some their soft limbs in painful marches try,<br/>
And war is all their wish, and arms the gen'ral cry.<br/>
Part scour the rusty shields with seam; and part<br/>
New grind the blunted ax, and point the dart:<br/>
With joy they view the waving ensigns fly,<br/>
And hear the trumpet's clangour pierce the sky.<br/>
Five cities forge their arms: th' Atinian pow'rs,<br/>
Antemnae, Tibur with her lofty tow'rs,<br/>
Ardea the proud, the Crustumerian town:<br/>
All these of old were places of renown.<br/>
Some hammer helmets for the fighting field;<br/>
Some twine young sallows to support the shield;<br/>
The croslet some, and some the cuishes mould,<br/>
With silver plated, and with ductile gold.<br/>
The rustic honours of the scythe and share<br/>
Give place to swords and plumes, the pride of war.<br/>
Old falchions are new temper'd in the fires;<br/>
The sounding trumpet ev'ry soul inspires.<br/>
The word is giv'n; with eager speed they lace<br/>
The shining headpiece, and the shield embrace.<br/>
The neighing steeds are to the chariot tied;<br/>
The trusty weapon sits on ev'ry side.
</p>
<p>
And now the mighty labour is begun<br/>
Ye Muses, open all your Helicon.<br/>
Sing you the chiefs that sway'd th' Ausonian land,<br/>
Their arms, and armies under their command;<br/>
What warriors in our ancient clime were bred;<br/>
What soldiers follow'd, and what heroes led.<br/>
For well you know, and can record alone,<br/>
What fame to future times conveys but darkly down.<br/>
Mezentius first appear'd upon the plain:<br/>
Scorn sate upon his brows, and sour disdain,<br/>
Defying earth and heav'n. Etruria lost,<br/>
He brings to Turnus' aid his baffled host.<br/>
The charming Lausus, full of youthful fire,<br/>
Rode in the rank, and next his sullen sire;<br/>
To Turnus only second in the grace<br/>
Of manly mien, and features of the face.<br/>
A skilful horseman, and a huntsman bred,<br/>
With fates averse a thousand men he led:<br/>
His sire unworthy of so brave a son;<br/>
Himself well worthy of a happier throne.
</p>
<p>
Next Aventinus drives his chariot round<br/>
The Latian plains, with palms and laurels crown'd.<br/>
Proud of his steeds, he smokes along the field;<br/>
His father's hydra fills his ample shield:<br/>
A hundred serpents hiss about the brims;<br/>
The son of Hercules he justly seems<br/>
By his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs;<br/>
Of heav'nly part, and part of earthly blood,<br/>
A mortal woman mixing with a god.<br/>
For strong Alcides, after he had slain<br/>
The triple Geryon, drove from conquer'd Spain<br/>
His captive herds; and, thence in triumph led,<br/>
On Tuscan Tiber's flow'ry banks they fed.<br/>
Then on Mount Aventine the son of Jove<br/>
The priestess Rhea found, and forc'd to love.<br/>
For arms, his men long piles and jav'lins bore;<br/>
And poles with pointed steel their foes in battle gore.<br/>
Like Hercules himself his son appears,<br/>
In salvage pomp; a lion's hide he wears;<br/>
About his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin;<br/>
The teeth and gaping jaws severely grin.<br/>
Thus, like the god his father, homely dress'd,<br/>
He strides into the hall, a horrid guest.
</p>
<p>
Then two twin brothers from fair Tibur came,<br/>
(Which from their brother Tiburs took the name,)<br/>
Fierce Coras and Catillus, void of fear:<br/>
Arm'd Argive horse they led, and in the front appear.<br/>
Like cloud-born Centaurs, from the mountain's height<br/>
With rapid course descending to the fight;<br/>
They rush along; the rattling woods give way;<br/>
The branches bend before their sweepy sway.
</p>
<p>
Nor was Praeneste's founder wanting there,<br/>
Whom fame reports the son of Mulciber:<br/>
Found in the fire, and foster'd in the plains,<br/>
A shepherd and a king at once he reigns,<br/>
And leads to Turnus' aid his country swains.<br/>
His own Praeneste sends a chosen band,<br/>
With those who plow Saturnia's Gabine land;<br/>
Besides the succour which cold Anien yields,<br/>
The rocks of Hernicus, and dewy fields,<br/>
Anagnia fat, and Father Amasene—<br/>
A num'rous rout, but all of naked men:<br/>
Nor arms they wear, nor swords and bucklers wield,<br/>
Nor drive the chariot thro' the dusty field,<br/>
But whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead,<br/>
And spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head;<br/>
The left foot naked, when they march to fight,<br/>
But in a bull's raw hide they sheathe the right.<br/>
Messapus next, (great Neptune was his sire,)<br/>
Secure of steel, and fated from the fire,<br/>
In pomp appears, and with his ardour warms<br/>
A heartless train, unexercis'd in arms:<br/>
The just Faliscans he to battle brings,<br/>
And those who live where Lake Ciminius springs;<br/>
And where Feronia's grove and temple stands,<br/>
Who till Fescennian or Flavinian lands.<br/>
All these in order march, and marching sing<br/>
The warlike actions of their sea-born king;<br/>
Like a long team of snowy swans on high,<br/>
Which clap their wings, and cleave the liquid sky,<br/>
When, homeward from their wat'ry pastures borne,<br/>
They sing, and Asia's lakes their notes return.<br/>
Not one who heard their music from afar,<br/>
Would think these troops an army train'd to war,<br/>
But flocks of fowl, that, when the tempests roar,<br/>
With their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore.
</p>
<p>
Then Clausus came, who led a num'rous band<br/>
Of troops embodied from the Sabine land,<br/>
And, in himself alone, an army brought.<br/>
'Twas he, the noble Claudian race begot,<br/>
The Claudian race, ordain'd, in times to come,<br/>
To share the greatness of imperial Rome.<br/>
He led the Cures forth, of old renown,<br/>
Mutuscans from their olive-bearing town,<br/>
And all th' Eretian pow'rs; besides a band<br/>
That follow'd from Velinum's dewy land,<br/>
And Amiternian troops, of mighty fame,<br/>
And mountaineers, that from Severus came,<br/>
And from the craggy cliffs of Tetrica,<br/>
And those where yellow Tiber takes his way,<br/>
And where Himella's wanton waters play.<br/>
Casperia sends her arms, with those that lie<br/>
By Fabaris, and fruitful Foruli:<br/>
The warlike aids of Horta next appear,<br/>
And the cold Nursians come to close the rear,<br/>
Mix'd with the natives born of Latine blood,<br/>
Whom Allia washes with her fatal flood.<br/>
Not thicker billows beat the Libyan main,<br/>
When pale Orion sets in wintry rain;<br/>
Nor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise,<br/>
Or Lycian fields, when Phoebus burns the skies,<br/>
Than stand these troops: their bucklers ring around;<br/>
Their trampling turns the turf, and shakes the solid ground.
</p>
<p>
High in his chariot then Halesus came,<br/>
A foe by birth to Troy's unhappy name:<br/>
From Agamemnon born—to Turnus' aid<br/>
A thousand men the youthful hero led,<br/>
Who till the Massic soil, for wine renown'd,<br/>
And fierce Auruncans from their hilly ground,<br/>
And those who live by Sidicinian shores,<br/>
And where with shoaly fords Vulturnus roars,<br/>
Cales' and Osca's old inhabitants,<br/>
And rough Saticulans, inur'd to wants:<br/>
Light demi-lances from afar they throw,<br/>
Fasten'd with leathern thongs, to gall the foe.<br/>
Short crooked swords in closer fight they wear;<br/>
And on their warding arm light bucklers bear.
</p>
<p>
Nor Oebalus, shalt thou be left unsung,<br/>
From nymph Semethis and old Telon sprung,<br/>
Who then in Teleboan Capri reign'd;<br/>
But that short isle th' ambitious youth disdain'd,<br/>
And o'er Campania stretch'd his ample sway,<br/>
Where swelling Sarnus seeks the Tyrrhene sea;<br/>
O'er Batulum, and where Abella sees,<br/>
From her high tow'rs, the harvest of her trees.<br/>
And these (as was the Teuton use of old)<br/>
Wield brazen swords, and brazen bucklers hold;<br/>
Sling weighty stones, when from afar they fight;<br/>
Their casques are cork, a covering thick and light.
</p>
<p>
Next these in rank, the warlike Ufens went,<br/>
And led the mountain troops that Nursia sent.<br/>
The rude Equicolae his rule obey'd;<br/>
Hunting their sport, and plund'ring was their trade.<br/>
In arms they plow'd, to battle still prepar'd:<br/>
Their soil was barren, and their hearts were hard.
</p>
<p>
Umbro the priest the proud Marrubians led,<br/>
By King Archippus sent to Turnus' aid,<br/>
And peaceful olives crown'd his hoary head.<br/>
His wand and holy words, the viper's rage,<br/>
And venom'd wounds of serpents could assuage.<br/>
He, when he pleas'd with powerful juice to steep<br/>
Their temples, shut their eyes in pleasing sleep.<br/>
But vain were Marsian herbs, and magic art,<br/>
To cure the wound giv'n by the Dardan dart:<br/>
Yet his untimely fate th' Angitian woods<br/>
In sighs remurmur'd to the Fucine floods.
</p>
<p>
The son of fam'd Hippolytus was there,<br/>
Fam'd as his sire, and, as his mother, fair;<br/>
Whom in Egerian groves Aricia bore,<br/>
And nurs'd his youth along the marshy shore,<br/>
Where great Diana's peaceful altars flame,<br/>
In fruitful fields; and Virbius was his name.<br/>
Hippolytus, as old records have said,<br/>
Was by his stepdam sought to share her bed;<br/>
But, when no female arts his mind could move,<br/>
She turn'd to furious hate her impious love.<br/>
Torn by wild horses on the sandy shore,<br/>
Another's crimes th' unhappy hunter bore,<br/>
Glutting his father's eyes with guiltless gore.<br/>
But chaste Diana, who his death deplor'd,<br/>
With Aesculapian herbs his life restor'd.<br/>
Then Jove, who saw from high, with just disdain,<br/>
The dead inspir'd with vital breath again,<br/>
Struck to the centre, with his flaming dart,<br/>
Th' unhappy founder of the godlike art.<br/>
But Trivia kept in secret shades alone<br/>
Her care, Hippolytus, to fate unknown;<br/>
And call'd him Virbius in th' Egerian grove,<br/>
Where then he liv'd obscure, but safe from Jove.<br/>
For this, from Trivia's temple and her wood<br/>
Are coursers driv'n, who shed their master's blood,<br/>
Affrighted by the monsters of the flood.<br/>
His son, the second Virbius, yet retain'd<br/>
His father's art, and warrior steeds he rein'd.
</p>
<p>
Amid the troops, and like the leading god,<br/>
High o'er the rest in arms the graceful Turnus rode:<br/>
A triple of plumes his crest adorn'd,<br/>
On which with belching flames Chimaera burn'd:<br/>
The more the kindled combat rises high'r,<br/>
The more with fury burns the blazing fire.<br/>
Fair Io grac'd his shield; but Io now<br/>
With horns exalted stands, and seems to low—<br/>
A noble charge! Her keeper by her side,<br/>
To watch her walks, his hundred eyes applied;<br/>
And on the brims her sire, the wat'ry god,<br/>
Roll'd from a silver urn his crystal flood.<br/>
A cloud of foot succeeds, and fills the fields<br/>
With swords, and pointed spears, and clatt'ring shields;<br/>
Of Argives, and of old Sicanian bands,<br/>
And those who plow the rich Rutulian lands;<br/>
Auruncan youth, and those Sacrana yields,<br/>
And the proud Labicans, with painted shields,<br/>
And those who near Numician streams reside,<br/>
And those whom Tiber's holy forests hide,<br/>
Or Circe's hills from the main land divide;<br/>
Where Ufens glides along the lowly lands,<br/>
Or the black water of Pomptina stands.
</p>
<p>
Last, from the Volscians fair Camilla came,<br/>
And led her warlike troops, a warrior dame;<br/>
Unbred to spinning, in the loom unskill'd,<br/>
She chose the nobler Pallas of the field.<br/>
Mix'd with the first, the fierce Virago fought,<br/>
Sustain'd the toils of arms, the danger sought,<br/>
Outstripp'd the winds in speed upon the plain,<br/>
Flew o'er the fields, nor hurt the bearded grain:<br/>
She swept the seas, and, as she skimm'd along,<br/>
Her flying feet unbath'd on billows hung.<br/>
Men, boys, and women, stupid with surprise,<br/>
Where'er she passes, fix their wond'ring eyes:<br/>
Longing they look, and, gaping at the sight,<br/>
Devour her o'er and o'er with vast delight;<br/>
Her purple habit sits with such a grace<br/>
On her smooth shoulders, and so suits her face;<br/>
Her head with ringlets of her hair is crown'd,<br/>
And in a golden caul the curls are bound.<br/>
She shakes her myrtle jav'lin; and, behind,<br/>
Her Lycian quiver dances in the wind.

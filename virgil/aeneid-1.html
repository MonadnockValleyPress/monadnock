<h1>Aeneid</h1>
<h2>by Virgil</h2>
<h3>Book I</h3>
<p>
Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate,<br/>
And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate,<br/>
Expell'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore.<br/>
Long labours, both by sea and land, he bore,<br/>
And in the doubtful war, before he won<br/>
The Latian realm, and built the destin'd town;<br/>
His banish'd gods restor'd to rites divine,<br/>
And settled sure succession in his line,<br/>
From whence the race of Alban fathers come,<br/>
And the long glories of majestic Rome.<br/>
O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate;<br/>
What goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate;<br/>
For what offence the Queen of Heav'n began<br/>
To persecute so brave, so just a man;<br/>
Involv'd his anxious life in endless cares,<br/>
Expos'd to wants, and hurried into wars!<br/>
Can heav'nly minds such high resentment show,<br/>
Or exercise their spite in human woe?
</p>
<p>
Against the Tiber's mouth, but far away,<br/>
An ancient town was seated on the sea;<br/>
A Tyrian colony; the people made<br/>
Stout for the war, and studious of their trade:<br/>
Carthage the name; belov'd by Juno more<br/>
Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore.<br/>
Here stood her chariot; here, if Heav'n were kind,<br/>
The seat of awful empire she design'd.<br/>
Yet she had heard an ancient rumour fly,<br/>
(Long cited by the people of the sky,)<br/>
That times to come should see the Trojan race<br/>
Her Carthage ruin, and her tow'rs deface;<br/>
Nor thus confin'd, the yoke of sov'reign sway<br/>
Should on the necks of all the nations lay.<br/>
She ponder'd this, and fear'd it was in fate;<br/>
Nor could forget the war she wag'd of late<br/>
For conqu'ring Greece against the Trojan state.<br/>
Besides, long causes working in her mind,<br/>
And secret seeds of envy, lay behind;<br/>
Deep graven in her heart the doom remain'd<br/>
Of partial Paris, and her form disdain'd;<br/>
The grace bestow'd on ravish'd Ganymed,<br/>
Electra's glories, and her injur'd bed.<br/>
Each was a cause alone; and all combin'd<br/>
To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind.<br/>
For this, far distant from the Latian coast<br/>
She drove the remnants of the Trojan host;<br/>
And sev'n long years th' unhappy wand'ring train<br/>
Were toss'd by storms, and scatter'd thro' the main.<br/>
Such time, such toil, requir'd the Roman name,<br/>
Such length of labour for so vast a frame.
</p>
<p>
Now scarce the Trojan fleet, with sails and oars,<br/>
Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores,<br/>
Ent'ring with cheerful shouts the wat'ry reign,<br/>
And plowing frothy furrows in the main;<br/>
When, lab'ring still with endless discontent,<br/>
The Queen of Heav'n did thus her fury vent:
</p>
<p>
"Then am I vanquish'd? must I yield?" said she,<br/>
"And must the Trojans reign in Italy?<br/>
So Fate will have it, and Jove adds his force;<br/>
Nor can my pow'r divert their happy course.<br/>
Could angry Pallas, with revengeful spleen,<br/>
The Grecian navy burn, and drown the men?<br/>
She, for the fault of one offending foe,<br/>
The bolts of Jove himself presum'd to throw:<br/>
With whirlwinds from beneath she toss'd the ship,<br/>
And bare expos'd the bosom of the deep;<br/>
Then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game,<br/>
The wretch, yet hissing with her father's flame,<br/>
She strongly seiz'd, and with a burning wound<br/>
Transfix'd, and naked, on a rock she bound.<br/>
But I, who walk in awful state above,<br/>
The majesty of heav'n, the sister wife of Jove,<br/>
For length of years my fruitless force employ<br/>
Against the thin remains of ruin'd Troy!<br/>
What nations now to Juno's pow'r will pray,<br/>
Or off'rings on my slighted altars lay?"
</p>
<p>
Thus rag'd the goddess; and, with fury fraught.<br/>
The restless regions of the storms she sought,<br/>
Where, in a spacious cave of living stone,<br/>
The tyrant Aeolus, from his airy throne,<br/>
With pow'r imperial curbs the struggling winds,<br/>
And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds.<br/>
This way and that th' impatient captives tend,<br/>
And, pressing for release, the mountains rend.<br/>
High in his hall th' undaunted monarch stands,<br/>
And shakes his scepter, and their rage commands;<br/>
Which did he not, their unresisted sway<br/>
Would sweep the world before them in their way;<br/>
Earth, air, and seas thro' empty space would roll,<br/>
And heav'n would fly before the driving soul.<br/>
In fear of this, the Father of the Gods<br/>
Confin'd their fury to those dark abodes,<br/>
And lock'd 'em safe within, oppress'd with mountain loads;<br/>
Impos'd a king, with arbitrary sway,<br/>
To loose their fetters, or their force allay.<br/>
To whom the suppliant queen her pray'rs address'd,<br/>
And thus the tenor of her suit express'd:
</p>
<p>
"O Aeolus! for to thee the King of Heav'n<br/>
The pow'r of tempests and of winds has giv'n;<br/>
Thy force alone their fury can restrain,<br/>
And smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main.<br/>
A race of wand'ring slaves, abhorr'd by me,<br/>
With prosp'rous passage cut the Tuscan sea;<br/>
To fruitful Italy their course they steer,<br/>
And for their vanquish'd gods design new temples there.<br/>
Raise all thy winds; with night involve the skies;<br/>
Sink or disperse my fatal enemies.<br/>
Twice sev'n, the charming daughters of the main,<br/>
Around my person wait, and bear my train:<br/>
Succeed my wish, and second my design;<br/>
The fairest, Deiopeia, shall be thine,<br/>
And make thee father of a happy line."
</p>
<p>
To this the god: "'Tis yours, O queen, to will<br/>
The work which duty binds me to fulfil.<br/>
These airy kingdoms, and this wide command,<br/>
Are all the presents of your bounteous hand:<br/>
Yours is my sov'reign's grace; and, as your guest,<br/>
I sit with gods at their celestial feast;<br/>
Raise tempests at your pleasure, or subdue;<br/>
Dispose of empire, which I hold from you."
</p>
<p>
He said, and hurl'd against the mountain side<br/>
His quiv'ring spear, and all the god applied.<br/>
The raging winds rush thro' the hollow wound,<br/>
And dance aloft in air, and skim along the ground;<br/>
Then, settling on the sea, the surges sweep,<br/>
Raise liquid mountains, and disclose the deep.<br/>
South, East, and West with mix'd confusion roar,<br/>
And roll the foaming billows to the shore.<br/>
The cables crack; the sailors' fearful cries<br/>
Ascend; and sable night involves the skies;<br/>
And heav'n itself is ravish'd from their eyes.<br/>
Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue;<br/>
Then flashing fires the transient light renew;<br/>
The face of things a frightful image bears,<br/>
And present death in various forms appears.<br/>
Struck with unusual fright, the Trojan chief,<br/>
With lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief;<br/>
And, "Thrice and four times happy those," he cried,<br/>
"That under Ilian walls before their parents died!<br/>
Tydides, bravest of the Grecian train!<br/>
Why could not I by that strong arm be slain,<br/>
And lie by noble Hector on the plain,<br/>
Or great Sarpedon, in those bloody fields<br/>
Where Simois rolls the bodies and the shields<br/>
Of heroes, whose dismember'd hands yet bear<br/>
The dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear!"
</p>
<p>
Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails,<br/>
Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails,<br/>
And rent the sheets; the raging billows rise,<br/>
And mount the tossing vessels to the skies:<br/>
Nor can the shiv'ring oars sustain the blow;<br/>
The galley gives her side, and turns her prow;<br/>
While those astern, descending down the steep,<br/>
Thro' gaping waves behold the boiling deep.<br/>
Three ships were hurried by the southern blast,<br/>
And on the secret shelves with fury cast.<br/>
Those hidden rocks th' Ausonian sailors knew:<br/>
They call'd them Altars, when they rose in view,<br/>
And show'd their spacious backs above the flood.<br/>
Three more fierce Eurus, in his angry mood,<br/>
Dash'd on the shallows of the moving sand,<br/>
And in mid ocean left them moor'd a-land.<br/>
Orontes' bark, that bore the Lycian crew,<br/>
(A horrid sight!) ev'n in the hero's view,<br/>
From stem to stern by waves was overborne:<br/>
The trembling pilot, from his rudder torn,<br/>
Was headlong hurl'd; thrice round the ship was toss'd,<br/>
Then bulg'd at once, and in the deep was lost;<br/>
And here and there above the waves were seen<br/>
Arms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men.<br/>
The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way,<br/>
And suck'd thro' loosen'd planks the rushing sea.<br/>
Ilioneus was her chief: Alethes old,<br/>
Achates faithful, Abas young and bold,<br/>
Endur'd not less; their ships, with gaping seams,<br/>
Admit the deluge of the briny streams.
</p>
<p>
Meantime imperial Neptune heard the sound<br/>
Of raging billows breaking on the ground.<br/>
Displeas'd, and fearing for his wat'ry reign,<br/>
He rear'd his awful head above the main,<br/>
Serene in majesty; then roll'd his eyes<br/>
Around the space of earth, and seas, and skies.<br/>
He saw the Trojan fleet dispers'd, distress'd,<br/>
By stormy winds and wintry heav'n oppress'd.<br/>
Full well the god his sister's envy knew,<br/>
And what her aims and what her arts pursue.<br/>
He summon'd Eurus and the western blast,<br/>
And first an angry glance on both he cast;<br/>
Then thus rebuk'd: "Audacious winds! from whence<br/>
This bold attempt, this rebel insolence?<br/>
Is it for you to ravage seas and land,<br/>
Unauthoriz'd by my supreme command?<br/>
To raise such mountains on the troubled main?<br/>
Whom I—but first 'tis fit the billows to restrain;<br/>
And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign.<br/>
Hence! to your lord my royal mandate bear,<br/>
The realms of ocean and the fields of air<br/>
Are mine, not his. By fatal lot to me<br/>
The liquid empire fell, and trident of the sea.<br/>
His pow'r to hollow caverns is confin'd:<br/>
There let him reign, the jailer of the wind,<br/>
With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call,<br/>
And boast and bluster in his empty hall."<br/>
He spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth'd the sea,<br/>
Dispell'd the darkness, and restor'd the day.<br/>
Cymothoe, Triton, and the sea-green train<br/>
Of beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main,<br/>
Clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands:<br/>
The god himself with ready trident stands,<br/>
And opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands;<br/>
Then heaves them off the shoals. Where'er he guides<br/>
His finny coursers and in triumph rides,<br/>
The waves unruffle and the sea subsides.<br/>
As, when in tumults rise th' ignoble crowd,<br/>
Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud;<br/>
And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly,<br/>
And all the rustic arms that fury can supply:<br/>
If then some grave and pious man appear,<br/>
They hush their noise, and lend a list'ning ear;<br/>
He soothes with sober words their angry mood,<br/>
And quenches their innate desire of blood:<br/>
So, when the Father of the Flood appears,<br/>
And o'er the seas his sov'reign trident rears,<br/>
Their fury falls: he skims the liquid plains,<br/>
High on his chariot, and, with loosen'd reins,<br/>
Majestic moves along, and awful peace maintains.<br/>
The weary Trojans ply their shatter'd oars<br/>
To nearest land, and make the Libyan shores.
</p>
<p>
Within a long recess there lies a bay:<br/>
An island shades it from the rolling sea,<br/>
And forms a port secure for ships to ride;<br/>
Broke by the jutting land, on either side,<br/>
In double streams the briny waters glide.<br/>
Betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene<br/>
Appears above, and groves for ever green:<br/>
A grot is form'd beneath, with mossy seats,<br/>
To rest the Nereids, and exclude the heats.<br/>
Down thro' the crannies of the living walls<br/>
The crystal streams descend in murm'ring falls:<br/>
No haulsers need to bind the vessels here,<br/>
Nor bearded anchors; for no storms they fear.<br/>
Sev'n ships within this happy harbour meet,<br/>
The thin remainders of the scatter'd fleet.<br/>
The Trojans, worn with toils, and spent with woes,<br/>
Leap on the welcome land, and seek their wish'd repose.
</p>
<p>
First, good Achates, with repeated strokes<br/>
Of clashing flints, their hidden fire provokes:<br/>
Short flame succeeds; a bed of wither'd leaves<br/>
The dying sparkles in their fall receives:<br/>
Caught into life, in fiery fumes they rise,<br/>
And, fed with stronger food, invade the skies.<br/>
The Trojans, dropping wet, or stand around<br/>
The cheerful blaze, or lie along the ground:<br/>
Some dry their corn, infected with the brine,<br/>
Then grind with marbles, and prepare to dine.<br/>
Aeneas climbs the mountain's airy brow,<br/>
And takes a prospect of the seas below,<br/>
If Capys thence, or Antheus he could spy,<br/>
Or see the streamers of Caicus fly.<br/>
No vessels were in view; but, on the plain,<br/>
Three beamy stags command a lordly train<br/>
Of branching heads: the more ignoble throng<br/>
Attend their stately steps, and slowly graze along.<br/>
He stood; and, while secure they fed below,<br/>
He took the quiver and the trusty bow<br/>
Achates us'd to bear: the leaders first<br/>
He laid along, and then the vulgar pierc'd;<br/>
Nor ceas'd his arrows, till the shady plain<br/>
Sev'n mighty bodies with their blood distain.<br/>
For the sev'n ships he made an equal share,<br/>
And to the port return'd, triumphant from the war.<br/>
The jars of gen'rous wine (Acestes' gift,<br/>
When his Trinacrian shores the navy left)<br/>
He set abroach, and for the feast prepar'd,<br/>
In equal portions with the ven'son shar'd.<br/>
Thus while he dealt it round, the pious chief<br/>
With cheerful words allay'd the common grief:<br/>
"Endure, and conquer! Jove will soon dispose<br/>
To future good our past and present woes.<br/>
With me, the rocks of Scylla you have tried;<br/>
Th' inhuman Cyclops and his den defied.<br/>
What greater ills hereafter can you bear?<br/>
Resume your courage and dismiss your care,<br/>
An hour will come, with pleasure to relate<br/>
Your sorrows past, as benefits of Fate.<br/>
Thro' various hazards and events, we move<br/>
To Latium and the realms foredoom'd by Jove.<br/>
Call'd to the seat (the promise of the skies)<br/>
Where Trojan kingdoms once again may rise,<br/>
Endure the hardships of your present state;<br/>
Live, and reserve yourselves for better fate."
</p>
<p>
These words he spoke, but spoke not from his heart;<br/>
His outward smiles conceal'd his inward smart.<br/>
The jolly crew, unmindful of the past,<br/>
The quarry share, their plenteous dinner haste.<br/>
Some strip the skin; some portion out the spoil;<br/>
The limbs, yet trembling, in the caldrons boil;<br/>
Some on the fire the reeking entrails broil.<br/>
Stretch'd on the grassy turf, at ease they dine,<br/>
Restore their strength with meat, and cheer their souls with wine.<br/>
Their hunger thus appeas'd, their care attends<br/>
The doubtful fortune of their absent friends:<br/>
Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess,<br/>
Whether to deem 'em dead, or in distress.<br/>
Above the rest, Aeneas mourns the fate<br/>
Of brave Orontes, and th' uncertain state<br/>
Of Gyas, Lycus, and of Amycus.<br/>
The day, but not their sorrows, ended thus.
</p>
<p>
When, from aloft, almighty Jove surveys<br/>
Earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas,<br/>
At length on Libyan realms he fix'd his eyes:<br/>
Whom, pond'ring thus on human miseries,<br/>
When Venus saw, she with a lowly look,<br/>
Not free from tears, her heav'nly sire bespoke:
</p>
<p>
"O King of Gods and Men! whose awful hand<br/>
Disperses thunder on the seas and land,<br/>
Disposing all with absolute command;<br/>
How could my pious son thy pow'r incense?<br/>
Or what, alas! is vanish'd Troy's offence?<br/>
Our hope of Italy not only lost,<br/>
On various seas by various tempests toss'd,<br/>
But shut from ev'ry shore, and barr'd from ev'ry coast.<br/>
You promis'd once, a progeny divine<br/>
Of Romans, rising from the Trojan line,<br/>
In after times should hold the world in awe,<br/>
And to the land and ocean give the law.<br/>
How is your doom revers'd, which eas'd my care<br/>
When Troy was ruin'd in that cruel war?<br/>
Then fates to fates I could oppose; but now,<br/>
When Fortune still pursues her former blow,<br/>
What can I hope? What worse can still succeed?<br/>
What end of labours has your will decreed?<br/>
Antenor, from the midst of Grecian hosts,<br/>
Could pass secure, and pierce th' Illyrian coasts,<br/>
Where, rolling down the steep, Timavus raves<br/>
And thro' nine channels disembogues his waves.<br/>
At length he founded Padua's happy seat,<br/>
And gave his Trojans a secure retreat;<br/>
There fix'd their arms, and there renew'd their name,<br/>
And there in quiet rules, and crown'd with fame.<br/>
But we, descended from your sacred line,<br/>
Entitled to your heav'n and rites divine,<br/>
Are banish'd earth; and, for the wrath of one,<br/>
Remov'd from Latium and the promis'd throne.<br/>
Are these our scepters? these our due rewards?<br/>
And is it thus that Jove his plighted faith regards?"
</p>
<p>
To whom the Father of th' immortal race,<br/>
Smiling with that serene indulgent face,<br/>
With which he drives the clouds and clears the skies,<br/>
First gave a holy kiss; then thus replies:
</p>
<p>
"Daughter, dismiss thy fears; to thy desire<br/>
The fates of thine are fix'd, and stand entire.<br/>
Thou shalt behold thy wish'd Lavinian walls;<br/>
And, ripe for heav'n, when fate Aeneas calls,<br/>
Then shalt thou bear him up, sublime, to me:<br/>
No councils have revers'd my firm decree.<br/>
And, lest new fears disturb thy happy state,<br/>
Know, I have search'd the mystic rolls of Fate:<br/>
Thy son (nor is th' appointed season far)<br/>
In Italy shall wage successful war,<br/>
Shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field,<br/>
And sov'reign laws impose, and cities build,<br/>
Till, after ev'ry foe subdued, the sun<br/>
Thrice thro' the signs his annual race shall run:<br/>
This is his time prefix'd. Ascanius then,<br/>
Now call'd Iulus, shall begin his reign.<br/>
He thirty rolling years the crown shall wear,<br/>
Then from Lavinium shall the seat transfer,<br/>
And, with hard labour, Alba Longa build.<br/>
The throne with his succession shall be fill'd<br/>
Three hundred circuits more: then shall be seen<br/>
Ilia the fair, a priestess and a queen,<br/>
Who, full of Mars, in time, with kindly throes,<br/>
Shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose.<br/>
The royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain:<br/>
Then Romulus his grandsire's throne shall gain,<br/>
Of martial tow'rs the founder shall become,<br/>
The people Romans call, the city Rome.<br/>
To them no bounds of empire I assign,<br/>
Nor term of years to their immortal line.<br/>
Ev'n haughty Juno, who, with endless broils,<br/>
Earth, seas, and heav'n, and Jove himself turmoils;<br/>
At length aton'd, her friendly pow'r shall join,<br/>
To cherish and advance the Trojan line.<br/>
The subject world shall Rome's dominion own,<br/>
And, prostrate, shall adore the nation of the gown.<br/>
An age is ripening in revolving fate<br/>
When Troy shall overturn the Grecian state,<br/>
And sweet revenge her conqu'ring sons shall call,<br/>
To crush the people that conspir'd her fall.<br/>
Then Caesar from the Julian stock shall rise,<br/>
Whose empire ocean, and whose fame the skies<br/>
Alone shall bound; whom, fraught with eastern spoils,<br/>
Our heav'n, the just reward of human toils,<br/>
Securely shall repay with rites divine;<br/>
And incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine.<br/>
Then dire debate and impious war shall cease,<br/>
And the stern age be soften'd into peace:<br/>
Then banish'd Faith shall once again return,<br/>
And Vestal fires in hallow'd temples burn;<br/>
And Remus with Quirinus shall sustain<br/>
The righteous laws, and fraud and force restrain.<br/>
Janus himself before his fane shall wait,<br/>
And keep the dreadful issues of his gate,<br/>
With bolts and iron bars: within remains<br/>
Imprison'd Fury, bound in brazen chains;<br/>
High on a trophy rais'd, of useless arms,<br/>
He sits, and threats the world with vain alarms."
</p>
<p>
He said, and sent Cyllenius with command<br/>
To free the ports, and ope the Punic land<br/>
To Trojan guests; lest, ignorant of fate,<br/>
The queen might force them from her town and state.<br/>
Down from the steep of heav'n Cyllenius flies,<br/>
And cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies.<br/>
Soon on the Libyan shore descends the god,<br/>
Performs his message, and displays his rod:<br/>
The surly murmurs of the people cease;<br/>
And, as the fates requir'd, they give the peace:<br/>
The queen herself suspends the rigid laws,<br/>
The Trojans pities, and protects their cause.
</p>
<p>
Meantime, in shades of night Aeneas lies:<br/>
Care seiz'd his soul, and sleep forsook his eyes.<br/>
But, when the sun restor'd the cheerful day,<br/>
He rose, the coast and country to survey,<br/>
Anxious and eager to discover more.<br/>
It look'd a wild uncultivated shore;<br/>
But, whether humankind, or beasts alone<br/>
Possess'd the new-found region, was unknown.<br/>
Beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides:<br/>
Tall trees surround the mountain's shady sides;<br/>
The bending brow above a safe retreat provides.<br/>
Arm'd with two pointed darts, he leaves his friends,<br/>
And true Achates on his steps attends.<br/>
Lo! in the deep recesses of the wood,<br/>
Before his eyes his goddess mother stood:<br/>
A huntress in her habit and her mien;<br/>
Her dress a maid, her air confess'd a queen.<br/>
Bare were her knees, and knots her garments bind;<br/>
Loose was her hair, and wanton'd in the wind;<br/>
Her hand sustain'd a bow; her quiver hung behind.<br/>
She seem'd a virgin of the Spartan blood:<br/>
With such array Harpalyce bestrode<br/>
Her Thracian courser and outstripp'd the rapid flood.<br/>
"Ho, strangers! have you lately seen," she said,<br/>
"One of my sisters, like myself array'd,<br/>
Who cross'd the lawn, or in the forest stray'd?<br/>
A painted quiver at her back she bore;<br/>
Varied with spots, a lynx's hide she wore;<br/>
And at full cry pursued the tusky boar."
</p>
<p>
Thus Venus: thus her son replied again:<br/>
"None of your sisters have we heard or seen,<br/>
O virgin! or what other name you bear<br/>
Above that style; O more than mortal fair!<br/>
Your voice and mien celestial birth betray!<br/>
If, as you seem, the sister of the day,<br/>
Or one at least of chaste Diana's train,<br/>
Let not an humble suppliant sue in vain;<br/>
But tell a stranger, long in tempests toss'd,<br/>
What earth we tread, and who commands the coast?<br/>
Then on your name shall wretched mortals call,<br/>
And offer'd victims at your altars fall."<br/>
"I dare not," she replied, "assume the name<br/>
Of goddess, or celestial honours claim:<br/>
For Tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear,<br/>
And purple buskins o'er their ankles wear.<br/>
Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are:<br/>
A people rude in peace, and rough in war.<br/>
The rising city, which from far you see,<br/>
Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony.<br/>
Phoenician Dido rules the growing state,<br/>
Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother's hate.<br/>
Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate;<br/>
Which I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known<br/>
For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne,<br/>
Possess'd fair Dido's bed; and either heart<br/>
At once was wounded with an equal dart.<br/>
Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid;<br/>
Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway'd:<br/>
One who condemn'd divine and human laws.<br/>
Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause.<br/>
The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth,<br/>
With steel invades his brother's life by stealth;<br/>
Before the sacred altar made him bleed,<br/>
And long from her conceal'd the cruel deed.<br/>
Some tale, some new pretence, he daily coin'd,<br/>
To soothe his sister, and delude her mind.<br/>
At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears<br/>
Of her unhappy lord: the spectre stares,<br/>
And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares.<br/>
The cruel altars and his fate he tells,<br/>
And the dire secret of his house reveals,<br/>
Then warns the widow, with her household gods,<br/>
To seek a refuge in remote abodes.<br/>
Last, to support her in so long a way,<br/>
He shows her where his hidden treasure lay.<br/>
Admonish'd thus, and seiz'd with mortal fright,<br/>
The queen provides companions of her flight:<br/>
They meet, and all combine to leave the state,<br/>
Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate.<br/>
They seize a fleet, which ready rigg'd they find;<br/>
Nor is Pygmalion's treasure left behind.<br/>
The vessels, heavy laden, put to sea<br/>
With prosp'rous winds; a woman leads the way.<br/>
I know not, if by stress of weather driv'n,<br/>
Or was their fatal course dispos'd by Heav'n;<br/>
At last they landed, where from far your eyes<br/>
May view the turrets of new Carthage rise;<br/>
There bought a space of ground, which Byrsa call'd,<br/>
From the bull's hide, they first inclos'd, and wall'd.<br/>
But whence are you? what country claims your birth?<br/>
What seek you, strangers, on our Libyan earth?"
</p>
<p>
To whom, with sorrow streaming from his eyes,<br/>
And deeply sighing, thus her son replies:<br/>
"Could you with patience hear, or I relate,<br/>
O nymph, the tedious annals of our fate!<br/>
Thro' such a train of woes if I should run,<br/>
The day would sooner than the tale be done!<br/>
From ancient Troy, by force expell'd, we came,<br/>
If you by chance have heard the Trojan name.<br/>
On various seas by various tempests toss'd,<br/>
At length we landed on your Libyan coast.<br/>
The good Aeneas am I call'd, a name,<br/>
While Fortune favour'd, not unknown to fame.<br/>
My household gods, companions of my woes,<br/>
With pious care I rescued from our foes.<br/>
To fruitful Italy my course was bent;<br/>
And from the King of Heav'n is my descent.<br/>
With twice ten sail I cross'd the Phrygian sea;<br/>
Fate and my mother goddess led my way.<br/>
Scarce sev'n, the thin remainders of my fleet,<br/>
From storms preserv'd, within your harbour meet.<br/>
Myself distress'd, an exile, and unknown,<br/>
Debarr'd from Europe, and from Asia thrown,<br/>
In Libyan deserts wander thus alone."
</p>
<p>
His tender parent could no longer bear;<br/>
But, interposing, sought to soothe his care.<br/>
"Whoe'er you are, not unbelov'd by Heav'n,<br/>
Since on our friendly shore your ships are driv'n:<br/>
Have courage: to the gods permit the rest,<br/>
And to the queen expose your just request.<br/>
Now take this earnest of success, for more:<br/>
Your scatter'd fleet is join'd upon the shore;<br/>
The winds are chang'd, your friends from danger free;<br/>
Or I renounce my skill in augury.<br/>
Twelve swans behold in beauteous order move,<br/>
And stoop with closing pinions from above;<br/>
Whom late the bird of Jove had driv'n along,<br/>
And thro' the clouds pursued the scatt'ring throng:<br/>
Now, all united in a goodly team,<br/>
They skim the ground, and seek the quiet stream.<br/>
As they, with joy returning, clap their wings,<br/>
And ride the circuit of the skies in rings;<br/>
Not otherwise your ships, and ev'ry friend,<br/>
Already hold the port, or with swift sails descend.<br/>
No more advice is needful; but pursue<br/>
The path before you, and the town in view."
</p>
<p>
Thus having said, she turn'd, and made appear<br/>
Her neck refulgent, and dishevel'd hair,<br/>
Which, flowing from her shoulders, reach'd the ground.<br/>
And widely spread ambrosial scents around:<br/>
In length of train descends her sweeping gown;<br/>
And, by her graceful walk, the Queen of Love is known.<br/>
The prince pursued the parting deity<br/>
With words like these: "Ah! whither do you fly?<br/>
Unkind and cruel! to deceive your son<br/>
In borrow'd shapes, and his embrace to shun;<br/>
Never to bless my sight, but thus unknown;<br/>
And still to speak in accents not your own."<br/>
Against the goddess these complaints he made,<br/>
But took the path, and her commands obey'd.<br/>
They march, obscure; for Venus kindly shrouds<br/>
With mists their persons, and involves in clouds,<br/>
That, thus unseen, their passage none might stay,<br/>
Or force to tell the causes of their way.<br/>
This part perform'd, the goddess flies sublime<br/>
To visit Paphos and her native clime;<br/>
Where garlands, ever green and ever fair,<br/>
With vows are offer'd, and with solemn pray'r:<br/>
A hundred altars in her temple smoke;<br/>
A thousand bleeding hearts her pow'r invoke.
</p>
<p>
They climb the next ascent, and, looking down,<br/>
Now at a nearer distance view the town.<br/>
The prince with wonder sees the stately tow'rs,<br/>
Which late were huts and shepherds' homely bow'rs,<br/>
The gates and streets; and hears, from ev'ry part,<br/>
The noise and busy concourse of the mart.<br/>
The toiling Tyrians on each other call<br/>
To ply their labour: some extend the wall;<br/>
Some build the citadel; the brawny throng<br/>
Or dig, or push unwieldly stones along.<br/>
Some for their dwellings choose a spot of ground,<br/>
Which, first design'd, with ditches they surround.<br/>
Some laws ordain; and some attend the choice<br/>
Of holy senates, and elect by voice.<br/>
Here some design a mole, while others there<br/>
Lay deep foundations for a theatre;<br/>
From marble quarries mighty columns hew,<br/>
For ornaments of scenes, and future view.<br/>
Such is their toil, and such their busy pains,<br/>
As exercise the bees in flow'ry plains,<br/>
When winter past, and summer scarce begun,<br/>
Invites them forth to labour in the sun;<br/>
Some lead their youth abroad, while some condense<br/>
Their liquid store, and some in cells dispense;<br/>
Some at the gate stand ready to receive<br/>
The golden burthen, and their friends relieve;<br/>
All with united force, combine to drive<br/>
The lazy drones from the laborious hive:<br/>
With envy stung, they view each other's deeds;<br/>
The fragrant work with diligence proceeds.<br/>
"Thrice happy you, whose walls already rise!"<br/>
Aeneas said, and view'd, with lifted eyes,<br/>
Their lofty tow'rs; then, ent'ring at the gate,<br/>
Conceal'd in clouds (prodigious to relate)<br/>
He mix'd, unmark'd, among the busy throng,<br/>
Borne by the tide, and pass'd unseen along.
</p>
<p>
Full in the centre of the town there stood,<br/>
Thick set with trees, a venerable wood.<br/>
The Tyrians, landing near this holy ground,<br/>
And digging here, a prosp'rous omen found:<br/>
From under earth a courser's head they drew,<br/>
Their growth and future fortune to foreshew.<br/>
This fated sign their foundress Juno gave,<br/>
Of a soil fruitful, and a people brave.<br/>
Sidonian Dido here with solemn state<br/>
Did Juno's temple build, and consecrate,<br/>
Enrich'd with gifts, and with a golden shrine;<br/>
But more the goddess made the place divine.<br/>
On brazen steps the marble threshold rose,<br/>
And brazen plates the cedar beams inclose:<br/>
The rafters are with brazen cov'rings crown'd;<br/>
The lofty doors on brazen hinges sound.<br/>
What first Aeneas in this place beheld,<br/>
Reviv'd his courage, and his fear expell'd.<br/>
For while, expecting there the queen, he rais'd<br/>
His wond'ring eyes, and round the temple gaz'd,<br/>
Admir'd the fortune of the rising town,<br/>
The striving artists, and their arts' renown;<br/>
He saw, in order painted on the wall,<br/>
Whatever did unhappy Troy befall:<br/>
The wars that fame around the world had blown,<br/>
All to the life, and ev'ry leader known.<br/>
There Agamemnon, Priam here, he spies,<br/>
And fierce Achilles, who both kings defies.<br/>
He stopp'd, and weeping said: "O friend! ev'n here<br/>
The monuments of Trojan woes appear!<br/>
Our known disasters fill ev'n foreign lands:<br/>
See there, where old unhappy Priam stands!<br/>
Ev'n the mute walls relate the warrior's fame,<br/>
And Trojan griefs the Tyrians' pity claim."<br/>
He said, his tears a ready passage find,<br/>
Devouring what he saw so well design'd,<br/>
And with an empty picture fed his mind:<br/>
For there he saw the fainting Grecians yield,<br/>
And here the trembling Trojans quit the field,<br/>
Pursued by fierce Achilles thro' the plain,<br/>
On his high chariot driving o'er the slain.<br/>
The tents of Rhesus next, his grief renew,<br/>
By their white sails betray'd to nightly view;<br/>
And wakeful Diomede, whose cruel sword<br/>
The sentries slew, nor spar'd their slumb'ring lord,<br/>
Then took the fiery steeds, ere yet the food<br/>
Of Troy they taste, or drink the Xanthian flood.<br/>
Elsewhere he saw where Troilus defied<br/>
Achilles, and unequal combat tried;<br/>
Then, where the boy disarm'd, with loosen'd reins,<br/>
Was by his horses hurried o'er the plains,<br/>
Hung by the neck and hair, and dragg'd around:<br/>
The hostile spear, yet sticking in his wound,<br/>
With tracks of blood inscrib'd the dusty ground.<br/>
Meantime the Trojan dames, oppress'd with woe,<br/>
To Pallas' fane in long procession go,<br/>
In hopes to reconcile their heav'nly foe.<br/>
They weep, they beat their breasts, they rend their hair,<br/>
And rich embroider'd vests for presents bear;<br/>
But the stern goddess stands unmov'd with pray'r.<br/>
Thrice round the Trojan walls Achilles drew<br/>
The corpse of Hector, whom in fight he slew.<br/>
Here Priam sues; and there, for sums of gold,<br/>
The lifeless body of his son is sold.<br/>
So sad an object, and so well express'd,<br/>
Drew sighs and groans from the griev'd hero's breast,<br/>
To see the figure of his lifeless friend,<br/>
And his old sire his helpless hand extend.<br/>
Himself he saw amidst the Grecian train,<br/>
Mix'd in the bloody battle on the plain;<br/>
And swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew,<br/>
His pompous ensigns, and his Indian crew.<br/>
Penthisilea there, with haughty grace,<br/>
Leads to the wars an Amazonian race:<br/>
In their right hands a pointed dart they wield;<br/>
The left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield.<br/>
Athwart her breast a golden belt she throws,<br/>
Amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes,<br/>
And dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose.
</p>
<p>
Thus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes,<br/>
Fix'd on the walls with wonder and surprise,<br/>
The beauteous Dido, with a num'rous train<br/>
And pomp of guards, ascends the sacred fane.<br/>
Such on Eurotas' banks, or Cynthus' height,<br/>
Diana seems; and so she charms the sight,<br/>
When in the dance the graceful goddess leads<br/>
The choir of nymphs, and overtops their heads:<br/>
Known by her quiver, and her lofty mien,<br/>
She walks majestic, and she looks their queen;<br/>
Latona sees her shine above the rest,<br/>
And feeds with secret joy her silent breast.<br/>
Such Dido was; with such becoming state,<br/>
Amidst the crowd, she walks serenely great.<br/>
Their labour to her future sway she speeds,<br/>
And passing with a gracious glance proceeds;<br/>
Then mounts the throne, high plac'd before the shrine:<br/>
In crowds around, the swarming people join.<br/>
She takes petitions, and dispenses laws,<br/>
Hears and determines ev'ry private cause;<br/>
Their tasks in equal portions she divides,<br/>
And, where unequal, there by lots decides.<br/>
Another way by chance Aeneas bends<br/>
His eyes, and unexpected sees his friends,<br/>
Antheus, Sergestus grave, Cloanthus strong,<br/>
And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng,<br/>
Whom late the tempest on the billows toss'd,<br/>
And widely scatter'd on another coast.<br/>
The prince, unseen, surpris'd with wonder stands,<br/>
And longs, with joyful haste, to join their hands;<br/>
But, doubtful of the wish'd event, he stays,<br/>
And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys,<br/>
Impatient till they told their present state,<br/>
And where they left their ships, and what their fate,<br/>
And why they came, and what was their request;<br/>
For these were sent, commission'd by the rest,<br/>
To sue for leave to land their sickly men,<br/>
And gain admission to the gracious queen.<br/>
Ent'ring, with cries they fill'd the holy fane;<br/>
Then thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began:
</p>
<p>
"O Queen! indulg'd by favour of the gods<br/>
To found an empire in these new abodes,<br/>
To build a town, with statutes to restrain<br/>
The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign,<br/>
We wretched Trojans, toss'd on ev'ry shore,<br/>
From sea to sea, thy clemency implore.<br/>
Forbid the fires our shipping to deface!<br/>
Receive th' unhappy fugitives to grace,<br/>
And spare the remnant of a pious race!<br/>
We come not with design of wasteful prey,<br/>
To drive the country, force the swains away:<br/>
Nor such our strength, nor such is our desire;<br/>
The vanquish'd dare not to such thoughts aspire.<br/>
A land there is, Hesperia nam'd of old;<br/>
The soil is fruitful, and the men are bold<br/>
Th' Oenotrians held it once, by common fame<br/>
Now call'd Italia, from the leader's name.<br/>
To that sweet region was our voyage bent,<br/>
When winds and ev'ry warring element<br/>
Disturb'd our course, and, far from sight of land,<br/>
Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand:<br/>
The sea came on; the South, with mighty roar,<br/>
Dispers'd and dash'd the rest upon the rocky shore.<br/>
Those few you see escap'd the storm, and fear,<br/>
Unless you interpose, a shipwreck here.<br/>
What men, what monsters, what inhuman race,<br/>
What laws, what barb'rous customs of the place,<br/>
Shut up a desert shore to drowning men,<br/>
And drive us to the cruel seas again?<br/>
If our hard fortune no compassion draws,<br/>
Nor hospitable rights, nor human laws,<br/>
The gods are just, and will revenge our cause.<br/>
Aeneas was our prince: a juster lord,<br/>
Or nobler warrior, never drew a sword;<br/>
Observant of the right, religious of his word.<br/>
If yet he lives, and draws this vital air,<br/>
Nor we, his friends, of safety shall despair;<br/>
Nor you, great queen, these offices repent,<br/>
Which he will equal, and perhaps augment.<br/>
We want not cities, nor Sicilian coasts,<br/>
Where King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts.<br/>
Permit our ships a shelter on your shores,<br/>
Refitted from your woods with planks and oars,<br/>
That, if our prince be safe, we may renew<br/>
Our destin'd course, and Italy pursue.<br/>
But if, O best of men, the Fates ordain<br/>
That thou art swallow'd in the Libyan main,<br/>
And if our young Iulus be no more,<br/>
Dismiss our navy from your friendly shore,<br/>
That we to good Acestes may return,<br/>
And with our friends our common losses mourn."<br/>
Thus spoke Ilioneus: the Trojan crew<br/>
With cries and clamours his request renew.
</p>
<p>
The modest queen a while, with downcast eyes,<br/>
Ponder'd the speech; then briefly thus replies:<br/>
"Trojans, dismiss your fears; my cruel fate,<br/>
And doubts attending an unsettled state,<br/>
Force me to guard my coast from foreign foes.<br/>
Who has not heard the story of your woes,<br/>
The name and fortune of your native place,<br/>
The fame and valour of the Phrygian race?<br/>
We Tyrians are not so devoid of sense,<br/>
Nor so remote from Phoebus' influence.<br/>
Whether to Latian shores your course is bent,<br/>
Or, driv'n by tempests from your first intent,<br/>
You seek the good Acestes' government,<br/>
Your men shall be receiv'd, your fleet repair'd,<br/>
And sail, with ships of convoy for your guard:<br/>
Or, would you stay, and join your friendly pow'rs<br/>
To raise and to defend the Tyrian tow'rs,<br/>
My wealth, my city, and myself are yours.<br/>
And would to Heav'n, the Storm, you felt, would bring<br/>
On Carthaginian coasts your wand'ring king.<br/>
My people shall, by my command, explore<br/>
The ports and creeks of ev'ry winding shore,<br/>
And towns, and wilds, and shady woods, in quest<br/>
Of so renown'd and so desir'd a guest."
</p>
<p>
Rais'd in his mind the Trojan hero stood,<br/>
And long'd to break from out his ambient cloud:<br/>
Achates found it, and thus urg'd his way:<br/>
"From whence, O goddess-born, this long delay?<br/>
What more can you desire, your welcome sure,<br/>
Your fleet in safety, and your friends secure?<br/>
One only wants; and him we saw in vain<br/>
Oppose the Storm, and swallow'd in the main.<br/>
Orontes in his fate our forfeit paid;<br/>
The rest agrees with what your mother said."<br/>
Scarce had he spoken, when the cloud gave way,<br/>
The mists flew upward and dissolv'd in day.
</p>
<p>
The Trojan chief appear'd in open sight,<br/>
August in visage, and serenely bright.<br/>
His mother goddess, with her hands divine,<br/>
Had form'd his curling locks, and made his temples shine,<br/>
And giv'n his rolling eyes a sparkling grace,<br/>
And breath'd a youthful vigour on his face;<br/>
Like polish'd ivory, beauteous to behold,<br/>
Or Parian marble, when enchas'd in gold:<br/>
Thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke,<br/>
And thus with manly modesty he spoke:
</p>
<p>
"He whom you seek am I; by tempests toss'd,<br/>
And sav'd from shipwreck on your Libyan coast;<br/>
Presenting, gracious queen, before your throne,<br/>
A prince that owes his life to you alone.<br/>
Fair majesty, the refuge and redress<br/>
Of those whom fate pursues, and wants oppress,<br/>
You, who your pious offices employ<br/>
To save the relics of abandon'd Troy;<br/>
Receive the shipwreck'd on your friendly shore,<br/>
With hospitable rites relieve the poor;<br/>
Associate in your town a wand'ring train,<br/>
And strangers in your palace entertain:<br/>
What thanks can wretched fugitives return,<br/>
Who, scatter'd thro' the world, in exile mourn?<br/>
The gods, if gods to goodness are inclin'd;<br/>
If acts of mercy touch their heav'nly mind,<br/>
And, more than all the gods, your gen'rous heart.<br/>
Conscious of worth, requite its own desert!<br/>
In you this age is happy, and this earth,<br/>
And parents more than mortal gave you birth.<br/>
While rolling rivers into seas shall run,<br/>
And round the space of heav'n the radiant sun;<br/>
While trees the mountain tops with shades supply,<br/>
Your honour, name, and praise shall never die.<br/>
Whate'er abode my fortune has assign'd,<br/>
Your image shall be present in my mind."<br/>
Thus having said, he turn'd with pious haste,<br/>
And joyful his expecting friends embrac'd:<br/>
With his right hand Ilioneus was grac'd,<br/>
Serestus with his left; then to his breast<br/>
Cloanthus and the noble Gyas press'd;<br/>
And so by turns descended to the rest.
</p>
<p>
The Tyrian queen stood fix'd upon his face,<br/>
Pleas'd with his motions, ravish'd with his grace;<br/>
Admir'd his fortunes, more admir'd the man;<br/>
Then recollected stood, and thus began:<br/>
"What fate, O goddess-born; what angry pow'rs<br/>
Have cast you shipwreck'd on our barren shores?<br/>
Are you the great Aeneas, known to fame,<br/>
Who from celestial seed your lineage claim?
</p>
<p>
The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore<br/>
To fam'd Anchises on th' Idaean shore?<br/>
It calls into my mind, tho' then a child,<br/>
When Teucer came, from Salamis exil'd,<br/>
And sought my father's aid, to be restor'd:<br/>
My father Belus then with fire and sword<br/>
Invaded Cyprus, made the region bare,<br/>
And, conqu'ring, finish'd the successful war.<br/>
From him the Trojan siege I understood,<br/>
The Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood.<br/>
Your foe himself the Dardan valour prais'd,<br/>
And his own ancestry from Trojans rais'd.<br/>
Enter, my noble guest, and you shall find,<br/>
If not a costly welcome, yet a kind:<br/>
For I myself, like you, have been distress'd,<br/>
Till Heav'n afforded me this place of rest;<br/>
Like you, an alien in a land unknown,<br/>
I learn to pity woes so like my own."<br/>
She said, and to the palace led her guest;<br/>
Then offer'd incense, and proclaim'd a feast.<br/>
Nor yet less careful for her absent friends,<br/>
Twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends;<br/>
Besides a hundred boars, a hundred lambs,<br/>
With bleating cries, attend their milky dams;<br/>
And jars of gen'rous wine and spacious bowls<br/>
She gives, to cheer the sailors' drooping souls.<br/>
Now purple hangings clothe the palace walls,<br/>
And sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls:<br/>
On Tyrian carpets, richly wrought, they dine;<br/>
With loads of massy plate the sideboards shine,<br/>
And antique vases, all of gold emboss'd<br/>
(The gold itself inferior to the cost),<br/>
Of curious work, where on the sides were seen<br/>
The fights and figures of illustrious men,<br/>
From their first founder to the present queen.
</p>
<p>
The good Aeneas, whose paternal care<br/>
Iulus' absence could no longer bear,<br/>
Dispatch'd Achates to the ships in haste,<br/>
To give a glad relation of the past,<br/>
And, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy,<br/>
Snatch'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy:<br/>
A robe of tissue, stiff with golden wire;<br/>
An upper vest, once Helen's rich attire,<br/>
From Argos by the fam'd adultress brought,<br/>
With golden flow'rs and winding foliage wrought,<br/>
Her mother Leda's present, when she came<br/>
To ruin Troy and set the world on flame;<br/>
The scepter Priam's eldest daughter bore,<br/>
Her orient necklace, and the crown she wore<br/>
Of double texture, glorious to behold,<br/>
One order set with gems, and one with gold.<br/>
Instructed thus, the wise Achates goes,<br/>
And in his diligence his duty shows.
</p>
<p>
But Venus, anxious for her son's affairs,<br/>
New counsels tries, and new designs prepares:<br/>
That Cupid should assume the shape and face<br/>
Of sweet Ascanius, and the sprightly grace;<br/>
Should bring the presents, in her nephew's stead,<br/>
And in Eliza's veins the gentle poison shed:<br/>
For much she fear'd the Tyrians, double-tongued,<br/>
And knew the town to Juno's care belong'd.<br/>
These thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke,<br/>
And thus alarm'd, to winged Love she spoke:<br/>
"My son, my strength, whose mighty pow'r alone<br/>
Controls the Thund'rer on his awful throne,<br/>
To thee thy much-afflicted mother flies,<br/>
And on thy succour and thy faith relies.<br/>
Thou know'st, my son, how Jove's revengeful wife,<br/>
By force and fraud, attempts thy brother's life;<br/>
And often hast thou mourn'd with me his pains.<br/>
Him Dido now with blandishment detains;<br/>
But I suspect the town where Juno reigns.<br/>
For this 'tis needful to prevent her art,<br/>
And fire with love the proud Phoenician's heart:<br/>
A love so violent, so strong, so sure,<br/>
As neither age can change, nor art can cure.<br/>
How this may be perform'd, now take my mind:<br/>
Ascanius by his father is design'd<br/>
To come, with presents laden, from the port,<br/>
To gratify the queen, and gain the court.<br/>
I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep,<br/>
And, ravish'd, in Idalian bow'rs to keep,<br/>
Or high Cythera, that the sweet deceit<br/>
May pass unseen, and none prevent the cheat.<br/>
Take thou his form and shape. I beg the grace<br/>
But only for a night's revolving space:<br/>
Thyself a boy, assume a boy's dissembled face;<br/>
That when, amidst the fervour of the feast,<br/>
The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast,<br/>
And with sweet kisses in her arms constrains,<br/>
Thou may'st infuse thy venom in her veins."<br/>
The God of Love obeys, and sets aside<br/>
His bow and quiver, and his plumy pride;<br/>
He walks Iulus in his mother's sight,<br/>
And in the sweet resemblance takes delight.
</p>
<p>
The goddess then to young Ascanius flies,<br/>
And in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes:<br/>
Lull'd in her lap, amidst a train of Loves,<br/>
She gently bears him to her blissful groves,<br/>
Then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head,<br/>
And softly lays him on a flow'ry bed.<br/>
Cupid meantime assum'd his form and face,<br/>
Foll'wing Achates with a shorter pace,<br/>
And brought the gifts. The queen already sate<br/>
Amidst the Trojan lords, in shining state,<br/>
High on a golden bed: her princely guest<br/>
Was next her side; in order sate the rest.<br/>
Then canisters with bread are heap'd on high;<br/>
Th' attendants water for their hands supply,<br/>
And, having wash'd, with silken towels dry.<br/>
Next fifty handmaids in long order bore<br/>
The censers, and with fumes the gods adore:<br/>
Then youths, and virgins twice as many, join<br/>
To place the dishes, and to serve the wine.<br/>
The Tyrian train, admitted to the feast,<br/>
Approach, and on the painted couches rest.<br/>
All on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze,<br/>
But view the beauteous boy with more amaze,<br/>
His rosy-colour'd cheeks, his radiant eyes,<br/>
His motions, voice, and shape, and all the god's disguise;<br/>
Nor pass unprais'd the vest and veil divine,<br/>
Which wand'ring foliage and rich flow'rs entwine.<br/>
But, far above the rest, the royal dame,<br/>
(Already doom'd to love's disastrous flame,)<br/>
With eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy,<br/>
Beholds the presents, and admires the boy.<br/>
The guileful god about the hero long,<br/>
With children's play, and false embraces, hung;<br/>
Then sought the queen: she took him to her arms<br/>
With greedy pleasure, and devour'd his charms.<br/>
Unhappy Dido little thought what guest,<br/>
How dire a god, she drew so near her breast;<br/>
But he, not mindless of his mother's pray'r,<br/>
Works in the pliant bosom of the fair,<br/>
And moulds her heart anew, and blots her former care.<br/>
The dead is to the living love resign'd;<br/>
And all Aeneas enters in her mind.
</p>
<p>
Now, when the rage of hunger was appeas'd,<br/>
The meat remov'd, and ev'ry guest was pleas'd,<br/>
The golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown'd,<br/>
And thro' the palace cheerful cries resound.<br/>
From gilded roofs depending lamps display<br/>
Nocturnal beams, that emulate the day.<br/>
A golden bowl, that shone with gems divine,<br/>
The queen commanded to be crown'd with wine:<br/>
The bowl that Belus us'd, and all the Tyrian line.<br/>
Then, silence thro' the hall proclaim'd, she spoke:<br/>
"O hospitable Jove! we thus invoke,<br/>
With solemn rites, thy sacred name and pow'r;<br/>
Bless to both nations this auspicious hour!<br/>
So may the Trojan and the Tyrian line<br/>
In lasting concord from this day combine.<br/>
Thou, Bacchus, god of joys and friendly cheer,<br/>
And gracious Juno, both be present here!<br/>
And you, my lords of Tyre, your vows address<br/>
To Heav'n with mine, to ratify the peace."<br/>
The goblet then she took, with nectar crown'd<br/>
(Sprinkling the first libations on the ground,)<br/>
And rais'd it to her mouth with sober grace;<br/>
Then, sipping, offer'd to the next in place.<br/>
'Twas Bitias whom she call'd, a thirsty soul;<br/>
He took the challenge, and embrac'd the bowl,<br/>
With pleasure swill'd the gold, nor ceas'd to draw,<br/>
Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw.<br/>
The goblet goes around: Iopas brought<br/>
His golden lyre, and sung what ancient Atlas taught:<br/>
The various labours of the wand'ring moon,<br/>
And whence proceed th' eclipses of the sun;<br/>
Th' original of men and beasts; and whence<br/>
The rains arise, and fires their warmth dispense,<br/>
And fix'd and erring stars dispose their influence;<br/>
What shakes the solid earth; what cause delays<br/>
The summer nights and shortens winter days.<br/>
With peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song:<br/>
Those peals are echo'd by the Trojan throng.<br/>
Th' unhappy queen with talk prolong'd the night,<br/>
And drank large draughts of love with vast delight;<br/>
Of Priam much enquir'd, of Hector more;<br/>
Then ask'd what arms the swarthy Memnon wore,<br/>
What troops he landed on the Trojan shore;<br/>
The steeds of Diomede varied the discourse,<br/>
And fierce Achilles, with his matchless force;<br/>
At length, as fate and her ill stars requir'd,<br/>
To hear the series of the war desir'd.<br/>
"Relate at large, my godlike guest," she said,<br/>
"The Grecian stratagems, the town betray'd:<br/>
The fatal issue of so long a war,<br/>
Your flight, your wand'rings, and your woes, declare;<br/>
For, since on ev'ry sea, on ev'ry coast,<br/>
Your men have been distress'd, your navy toss'd,<br/>
Sev'n times the sun has either tropic view'd,<br/>
The winter banish'd, and the spring renew'd."

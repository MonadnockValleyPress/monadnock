<h1>Aeneid</h1>
<h2>by Virgil</h2>
<h3>Book IV</h3>
<p>
But anxious cares already seiz'd the queen:<br/>
She fed within her veins a flame unseen;<br/>
The hero's valour, acts, and birth inspire<br/>
Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire.<br/>
His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart,<br/>
Improve the passion, and increase the smart.<br/>
Now, when the purple morn had chas'd away<br/>
The dewy shadows, and restor'd the day,<br/>
Her sister first with early care she sought,<br/>
And thus in mournful accents eas'd her thought:
</p>
<p>
"My dearest Anna, what new dreams affright<br/>
My lab'ring soul! what visions of the night<br/>
Disturb my quiet, and distract my breast<br/>
With strange ideas of our Trojan guest!<br/>
His worth, his actions, and majestic air,<br/>
A man descended from the gods declare.<br/>
Fear ever argues a degenerate kind;<br/>
His birth is well asserted by his mind.<br/>
Then, what he suffer'd, when by Fate betray'd!<br/>
What brave attempts for falling Troy he made!<br/>
Such were his looks, so gracefully he spoke,<br/>
That, were I not resolv'd against the yoke<br/>
Of hapless marriage, never to be curst<br/>
With second love, so fatal was my first,<br/>
To this one error I might yield again;<br/>
For, since Sichaeus was untimely slain,<br/>
This only man is able to subvert<br/>
The fix'd foundations of my stubborn heart.<br/>
And, to confess my frailty, to my shame,<br/>
Somewhat I find within, if not the same,<br/>
Too like the sparkles of my former flame.<br/>
But first let yawning earth a passage rend,<br/>
And let me thro' the dark abyss descend;<br/>
First let avenging Jove, with flames from high,<br/>
Drive down this body to the nether sky,<br/>
Condemn'd with ghosts in endless night to lie,<br/>
Before I break the plighted faith I gave!<br/>
No! he who had my vows shall ever have;<br/>
For, whom I lov'd on earth, I worship in the grave."
</p>
<p>
She said: the tears ran gushing from her eyes,<br/>
And stopp'd her speech. Her sister thus replies:<br/>
"O dearer than the vital air I breathe,<br/>
Will you to grief your blooming years bequeath,<br/>
Condemn'd to waste in woes your lonely life,<br/>
Without the joys of mother or of wife?<br/>
Think you these tears, this pompous train of woe,<br/>
Are known or valued by the ghosts below?<br/>
I grant that, while your sorrows yet were green,<br/>
It well became a woman, and a queen,<br/>
The vows of Tyrian princes to neglect,<br/>
To scorn Hyarbas, and his love reject,<br/>
With all the Libyan lords of mighty name;<br/>
But will you fight against a pleasing flame!<br/>
This little spot of land, which Heav'n bestows,<br/>
On ev'ry side is hemm'd with warlike foes;<br/>
Gaetulian cities here are spread around,<br/>
And fierce Numidians there your frontiers bound;<br/>
Here lies a barren waste of thirsty land,<br/>
And there the Syrtes raise the moving sand;<br/>
Barcaean troops besiege the narrow shore,<br/>
And from the sea Pygmalion threatens more.<br/>
Propitious Heav'n, and gracious Juno, lead<br/>
This wand'ring navy to your needful aid:<br/>
How will your empire spread, your city rise,<br/>
From such a union, and with such allies?<br/>
Implore the favour of the pow'rs above,<br/>
And leave the conduct of the rest to love.<br/>
Continue still your hospitable way,<br/>
And still invent occasions of their stay,<br/>
Till storms and winter winds shall cease to threat,<br/>
And planks and oars repair their shatter'd fleet."
</p>
<p>
These words, which from a friend and sister came,<br/>
With ease resolv'd the scruples of her fame,<br/>
And added fury to the kindled flame.<br/>
Inspir'd with hope, the project they pursue;<br/>
On ev'ry altar sacrifice renew:<br/>
A chosen ewe of two years old they pay<br/>
To Ceres, Bacchus, and the God of Day;<br/>
Preferring Juno's pow'r, for Juno ties<br/>
The nuptial knot and makes the marriage joys.<br/>
The beauteous queen before her altar stands,<br/>
And holds the golden goblet in her hands.<br/>
A milk-white heifer she with flow'rs adorns,<br/>
And pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns;<br/>
And, while the priests with pray'r the gods invoke,<br/>
She feeds their altars with Sabaean smoke,<br/>
With hourly care the sacrifice renews,<br/>
And anxiously the panting entrails views.<br/>
What priestly rites, alas! what pious art,<br/>
What vows avail to cure a bleeding heart!<br/>
A gentle fire she feeds within her veins,<br/>
Where the soft god secure in silence reigns.
</p>
<p>
Sick with desire, and seeking him she loves,<br/>
From street to street the raving Dido roves.<br/>
So when the watchful shepherd, from the blind,<br/>
Wounds with a random shaft the careless hind,<br/>
Distracted with her pain she flies the woods,<br/>
Bounds o'er the lawn, and seeks the silent floods,<br/>
With fruitless care; for still the fatal dart<br/>
Sticks in her side, and rankles in her heart.<br/>
And now she leads the Trojan chief along<br/>
The lofty walls, amidst the busy throng;<br/>
Displays her Tyrian wealth, and rising town,<br/>
Which love, without his labour, makes his own.<br/>
This pomp she shows, to tempt her wand'ring guest;<br/>
Her falt'ring tongue forbids to speak the rest.<br/>
When day declines, and feasts renew the night,<br/>
Still on his face she feeds her famish'd sight;<br/>
She longs again to hear the prince relate<br/>
His own adventures and the Trojan fate.<br/>
He tells it o'er and o'er; but still in vain,<br/>
For still she begs to hear it once again.<br/>
The hearer on the speaker's mouth depends,<br/>
And thus the tragic story never ends.
</p>
<p>
Then, when they part, when Phoebe's paler light<br/>
Withdraws, and falling stars to sleep invite,<br/>
She last remains, when ev'ry guest is gone,<br/>
Sits on the bed he press'd, and sighs alone;<br/>
Absent, her absent hero sees and hears;<br/>
Or in her bosom young Ascanius bears,<br/>
And seeks the father's image in the child,<br/>
If love by likeness might be so beguil'd.
</p>
<p>
Meantime the rising tow'rs are at a stand;<br/>
No labours exercise the youthful band,<br/>
Nor use of arts, nor toils of arms they know;<br/>
The mole is left unfinish'd to the foe;<br/>
The mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie,<br/>
Short of their promis'd height, that seem'd to threat the sky,
</p>
<p>
But when imperial Juno, from above,<br/>
Saw Dido fetter'd in the chains of love,<br/>
Hot with the venom which her veins inflam'd,<br/>
And by no sense of shame to be reclaim'd,<br/>
With soothing words to Venus she begun:<br/>
"High praises, endless honours, you have won,<br/>
And mighty trophies, with your worthy son!<br/>
Two gods a silly woman have undone!<br/>
Nor am I ignorant, you both suspect<br/>
This rising city, which my hands erect:<br/>
But shall celestial discord never cease?<br/>
'Tis better ended in a lasting peace.<br/>
You stand possess'd of all your soul desir'd:<br/>
Poor Dido with consuming love is fir'd.<br/>
Your Trojan with my Tyrian let us join;<br/>
So Dido shall be yours, Aeneas mine:<br/>
One common kingdom, one united line.<br/>
Eliza shall a Dardan lord obey,<br/>
And lofty Carthage for a dow'r convey."<br/>
Then Venus, who her hidden fraud descried,<br/>
Which would the scepter of the world misguide<br/>
To Libyan shores, thus artfully replied:<br/>
"Who, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose,<br/>
And such alliance and such gifts refuse,<br/>
If Fortune with our joint desires comply?<br/>
The doubt is all from Jove and destiny;<br/>
Lest he forbid, with absolute command,<br/>
To mix the people in one common land.<br/>
Or will the Trojan and the Tyrian line<br/>
In lasting leagues and sure succession join?<br/>
But you, the partner of his bed and throne,<br/>
May move his mind; my wishes are your own."
</p>
<p>
"Mine," said imperial Juno, "be the care;<br/>
Time urges, now, to perfect this affair:<br/>
Attend my counsel, and the secret share.<br/>
When next the Sun his rising light displays,<br/>
And gilds the world below with purple rays,<br/>
The queen, Aeneas, and the Tyrian court<br/>
Shall to the shady woods, for sylvan game, resort.<br/>
There, while the huntsmen pitch their toils around,<br/>
And cheerful horns from side to side resound,<br/>
A pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain<br/>
With hail, and thunder, and tempestuous rain;<br/>
The fearful train shall take their speedy flight,<br/>
Dispers'd, and all involv'd in gloomy night;<br/>
One cave a grateful shelter shall afford<br/>
To the fair princess and the Trojan lord.<br/>
I will myself the bridal bed prepare,<br/>
If you, to bless the nuptials, will be there:<br/>
So shall their loves be crown'd with due delights,<br/>
And Hymen shall be present at the rites."<br/>
The Queen of Love consents, and closely smiles<br/>
At her vain project, and discover'd wiles.
</p>
<p>
The rosy morn was risen from the main,<br/>
And horns and hounds awake the princely train:<br/>
They issue early thro' the city gate,<br/>
Where the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait,<br/>
With nets, and toils, and darts, beside the force<br/>
Of Spartan dogs, and swift Massylian horse.<br/>
The Tyrian peers and officers of state<br/>
For the slow queen in antechambers wait;<br/>
Her lofty courser, in the court below,<br/>
Who his majestic rider seems to know,<br/>
Proud of his purple trappings, paws the ground,<br/>
And champs the golden bit, and spreads the foam around.<br/>
The queen at length appears; on either hand<br/>
The brawny guards in martial order stand.<br/>
A flow'r'd simar with golden fringe she wore,<br/>
And at her back a golden quiver bore;<br/>
Her flowing hair a golden caul restrains,<br/>
A golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains.<br/>
Then young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace,<br/>
Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase.<br/>
But far above the rest in beauty shines<br/>
The great Aeneas, the troop he joins;<br/>
Like fair Apollo, when he leaves the frost<br/>
Of wint'ry Xanthus, and the Lycian coast,<br/>
When to his native Delos he resorts,<br/>
Ordains the dances, and renews the sports;<br/>
Where painted Scythians, mix'd with Cretan bands,<br/>
Before the joyful altars join their hands:<br/>
Himself, on Cynthus walking, sees below<br/>
The merry madness of the sacred show.<br/>
Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose;<br/>
A golden fillet binds his awful brows;<br/>
His quiver sounds: not less the prince is seen<br/>
In manly presence, or in lofty mien.
</p>
<p>
Now had they reach'd the hills, and storm'd the seat<br/>
Of salvage beasts, in dens, their last retreat.<br/>
The cry pursues the mountain goats: they bound<br/>
From rock to rock, and keep the craggy ground;<br/>
Quite otherwise the stags, a trembling train,<br/>
In herds unsingled, scour the dusty plain,<br/>
And a long chase in open view maintain.<br/>
The glad Ascanius, as his courser guides,<br/>
Spurs thro' the vale, and these and those outrides.<br/>
His horse's flanks and sides are forc'd to feel<br/>
The clanking lash, and goring of the steel.<br/>
Impatiently he views the feeble prey,<br/>
Wishing some nobler beast to cross his way,<br/>
And rather would the tusky boar attend,<br/>
Or see the tawny lion downward bend.
</p>
<p>
Meantime, the gath'ring clouds obscure the skies:<br/>
From pole to pole the forky lightning flies;<br/>
The rattling thunders roll; and Juno pours<br/>
A wintry deluge down, and sounding show'rs.<br/>
The company, dispers'd, to converts ride,<br/>
And seek the homely cots, or mountain's hollow side.<br/>
The rapid rains, descending from the hills,<br/>
To rolling torrents raise the creeping rills.<br/>
The queen and prince, as love or fortune guides,<br/>
One common cavern in her bosom hides.<br/>
Then first the trembling earth the signal gave,<br/>
And flashing fires enlighten all the cave;<br/>
Hell from below, and Juno from above,<br/>
And howling nymphs, were conscious of their love.<br/>
From this ill-omen'd hour in time arose<br/>
Debate and death, and all succeeding woes.
</p>
<p>
The queen, whom sense of honour could not move,<br/>
No longer made a secret of her love,<br/>
But call'd it marriage, by that specious name<br/>
To veil the crime and sanctify the shame.
</p>
<p>
The loud report thro' Libyan cities goes.<br/>
Fame, the great ill, from small beginnings grows:<br/>
Swift from the first; and ev'ry moment brings<br/>
New vigour to her flights, new pinions to her wings.<br/>
Soon grows the pigmy to gigantic size;<br/>
Her feet on earth, her forehead in the skies.<br/>
Inrag'd against the gods, revengeful Earth<br/>
Produc'd her last of the Titanian birth.<br/>
Swift is her walk, more swift her winged haste:<br/>
A monstrous phantom, horrible and vast.<br/>
As many plumes as raise her lofty flight,<br/>
So many piercing eyes inlarge her sight;<br/>
Millions of opening mouths to Fame belong,<br/>
And ev'ry mouth is furnish'd with a tongue,<br/>
And round with list'ning ears the flying plague is hung.<br/>
She fills the peaceful universe with cries;<br/>
No slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes;<br/>
By day, from lofty tow'rs her head she shews,<br/>
And spreads thro' trembling crowds disastrous news;<br/>
With court informers haunts, and royal spies;<br/>
Things done relates, not done she feigns, and mingles truth with lies.
</p>
<p>
Talk is her business, and her chief delight<br/>
To tell of prodigies and cause affright.<br/>
She fills the people's ears with Dido's name,<br/>
Who, lost to honour and the sense of shame,<br/>
Admits into her throne and nuptial bed<br/>
A wand'ring guest, who from his country fled:<br/>
Whole days with him she passes in delights,<br/>
And wastes in luxury long winter nights,<br/>
Forgetful of her fame and royal trust,<br/>
Dissolv'd in ease, abandon'd to her lust.
</p>
<p>
The goddess widely spreads the loud report,<br/>
And flies at length to King Hyarba's court.<br/>
When first possess'd with this unwelcome news<br/>
Whom did he not of men and gods accuse?<br/>
This prince, from ravish'd Garamantis born,<br/>
A hundred temples did with spoils adorn,<br/>
In Ammon's honour, his celestial sire;<br/>
A hundred altars fed with wakeful fire;<br/>
And, thro' his vast dominions, priests ordain'd,<br/>
Whose watchful care these holy rites maintain'd.<br/>
The gates and columns were with garlands crown'd,<br/>
And blood of victim beasts enrich'd the ground.
</p>
<p>
He, when he heard a fugitive could move<br/>
The Tyrian princess, who disdain'd his love,<br/>
His breast with fury burn'd, his eyes with fire,<br/>
Mad with despair, impatient with desire;<br/>
Then on the sacred altars pouring wine,<br/>
He thus with pray'rs implor'd his sire divine:<br/>
"Great Jove! propitious to the Moorish race,<br/>
Who feast on painted beds, with off'rings grace<br/>
Thy temples, and adore thy pow'r divine<br/>
With blood of victims, and with sparkling wine,<br/>
Seest thou not this? or do we fear in vain<br/>
Thy boasted thunder, and thy thoughtless reign?<br/>
Do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance?<br/>
Thine are the bolts, or the blind work of chance?<br/>
A wand'ring woman builds, within our state,<br/>
A little town, bought at an easy rate;<br/>
She pays me homage, and my grants allow<br/>
A narrow space of Libyan lands to plow;<br/>
Yet, scorning me, by passion blindly led,<br/>
Admits a banish'd Trojan to her bed!<br/>
And now this other Paris, with his train<br/>
Of conquer'd cowards, must in Afric reign!<br/>
(Whom, what they are, their looks and garb confess,<br/>
Their locks with oil perfum'd, their Lydian dress.)<br/>
He takes the spoil, enjoys the princely dame;<br/>
And I, rejected I, adore an empty name."
</p>
<p>
His vows, in haughty terms, he thus preferr'd,<br/>
And held his altar's horns. The mighty Thund'rer heard;<br/>
Then cast his eyes on Carthage, where he found<br/>
The lustful pair in lawless pleasure drown'd,<br/>
Lost in their loves, insensible of shame,<br/>
And both forgetful of their better fame.<br/>
He calls Cyllenius, and the god attends,<br/>
By whom his menacing command he sends:<br/>
"Go, mount the western winds, and cleave the sky;<br/>
Then, with a swift descent, to Carthage fly:<br/>
There find the Trojan chief, who wastes his days<br/>
In slothful riot and inglorious ease,<br/>
Nor minds the future city, giv'n by fate.<br/>
To him this message from my mouth relate:<br/>
'Not so fair Venus hop'd, when twice she won<br/>
Thy life with pray'rs, nor promis'd such a son.<br/>
Hers was a hero, destin'd to command<br/>
A martial race, and rule the Latian land,<br/>
Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw,<br/>
And on the conquer'd world impose the law.'<br/>
If glory cannot move a mind so mean,<br/>
Nor future praise from fading pleasure wean,<br/>
Yet why should he defraud his son of fame,<br/>
And grudge the Romans their immortal name!<br/>
What are his vain designs! what hopes he more<br/>
From his long ling'ring on a hostile shore,<br/>
Regardless to redeem his honour lost,<br/>
And for his race to gain th' Ausonian coast!<br/>
Bid him with speed the Tyrian court forsake;<br/>
With this command the slumb'ring warrior wake."
</p>
<p>
Hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds<br/>
His flying feet, and mounts the western winds:<br/>
And, whether o'er the seas or earth he flies,<br/>
With rapid force they bear him down the skies.<br/>
But first he grasps within his awful hand<br/>
The mark of sov'reign pow'r, his magic wand;<br/>
With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves;<br/>
With this he drives them down the Stygian waves;<br/>
With this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight,<br/>
And eyes, tho' clos'd in death, restores to light.<br/>
Thus arm'd, the god begins his airy race,<br/>
And drives the racking clouds along the liquid space;<br/>
Now sees the tops of Atlas, as he flies,<br/>
Whose brawny back supports the starry skies;<br/>
Atlas, whose head, with piny forests crown'd,<br/>
Is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapours bound.<br/>
Snows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin<br/>
The founts of rolling streams their race begin;<br/>
A beard of ice on his large breast depends.<br/>
Here, pois'd upon his wings, the god descends:<br/>
Then, rested thus, he from the tow'ring height<br/>
Plung'd downward, with precipitated flight,<br/>
Lights on the seas, and skims along the flood.<br/>
As waterfowl, who seek their fishy food,<br/>
Less, and yet less, to distant prospect show;<br/>
By turns they dance aloft, and dive below:<br/>
Like these, the steerage of his wings he plies,<br/>
And near the surface of the water flies,<br/>
Till, having pass'd the seas, and cross'd the sands,<br/>
He clos'd his wings, and stoop'd on Libyan lands:<br/>
Where shepherds once were hous'd in homely sheds,<br/>
Now tow'rs within the clouds advance their heads.<br/>
Arriving there, he found the Trojan prince<br/>
New ramparts raising for the town's defence.<br/>
A purple scarf, with gold embroider'd o'er,<br/>
(Queen Dido's gift,) about his waist he wore;<br/>
A sword, with glitt'ring gems diversified,<br/>
For ornament, not use, hung idly by his side.
</p>
<p>
Then thus, with winged words, the god began,<br/>
Resuming his own shape: "Degenerate man,<br/>
Thou woman's property, what mak'st thou here,<br/>
These foreign walls and Tyrian tow'rs to rear,<br/>
Forgetful of thy own? All-pow'rful Jove,<br/>
Who sways the world below and heav'n above,<br/>
Has sent me down with this severe command:<br/>
What means thy ling'ring in the Libyan land?<br/>
If glory cannot move a mind so mean,<br/>
Nor future praise from flitting pleasure wean,<br/>
Regard the fortunes of thy rising heir:<br/>
The promis'd crown let young Ascanius wear,<br/>
To whom th' Ausonian scepter, and the state<br/>
Of Rome's imperial name is ow'd by fate."<br/>
So spoke the god; and, speaking, took his flight,<br/>
Involv'd in clouds, and vanish'd out of sight.
</p>
<p>
The pious prince was seiz'd with sudden fear;<br/>
Mute was his tongue, and upright stood his hair.<br/>
Revolving in his mind the stern command,<br/>
He longs to fly, and loathes the charming land.<br/>
What should he say? or how should he begin?<br/>
What course, alas! remains to steer between<br/>
Th' offended lover and the pow'rful queen?<br/>
This way and that he turns his anxious mind,<br/>
And all expedients tries, and none can find.<br/>
Fix'd on the deed, but doubtful of the means,<br/>
After long thought, to this advice he leans:<br/>
Three chiefs he calls, commands them to repair<br/>
The fleet, and ship their men with silent care;<br/>
Some plausible pretence he bids them find,<br/>
To colour what in secret he design'd.<br/>
Himself, meantime, the softest hours would choose,<br/>
Before the love-sick lady heard the news;<br/>
And move her tender mind, by slow degrees,<br/>
To suffer what the sov'reign pow'r decrees:<br/>
Jove will inspire him, when, and what to say.<br/>
They hear with pleasure, and with haste obey.
</p>
<p>
But soon the queen perceives the thin disguise:<br/>
(What arts can blind a jealous woman's eyes!)<br/>
She was the first to find the secret fraud,<br/>
Before the fatal news was blaz'd abroad.<br/>
Love the first motions of the lover hears,<br/>
Quick to presage, and ev'n in safety fears.<br/>
Nor impious Fame was wanting to report<br/>
The ships repair'd, the Trojans' thick resort,<br/>
And purpose to forsake the Tyrian court.<br/>
Frantic with fear, impatient of the wound,<br/>
And impotent of mind, she roves the city round.<br/>
Less wild the Bacchanalian dames appear,<br/>
When, from afar, their nightly god they hear,<br/>
And howl about the hills, and shake the wreathy spear.<br/>
At length she finds the dear perfidious man;<br/>
Prevents his form'd excuse, and thus began:<br/>
"Base and ungrateful! could you hope to fly,<br/>
And undiscover'd scape a lover's eye?<br/>
Nor could my kindness your compassion move.<br/>
Nor plighted vows, nor dearer bands of love?<br/>
Or is the death of a despairing queen<br/>
Not worth preventing, tho' too well foreseen?<br/>
Ev'n when the wintry winds command your stay,<br/>
You dare the tempests, and defy the sea.<br/>
False as you are, suppose you were not bound<br/>
To lands unknown, and foreign coasts to sound;<br/>
Were Troy restor'd, and Priam's happy reign,<br/>
Now durst you tempt, for Troy, the raging main?<br/>
See whom you fly! am I the foe you shun?<br/>
Now, by those holy vows, so late begun,<br/>
By this right hand, (since I have nothing more<br/>
To challenge, but the faith you gave before;)<br/>
I beg you by these tears too truly shed,<br/>
By the new pleasures of our nuptial bed;<br/>
If ever Dido, when you most were kind,<br/>
Were pleasing in your eyes, or touch'd your mind;<br/>
By these my pray'rs, if pray'rs may yet have place,<br/>
Pity the fortunes of a falling race.<br/>
For you I have provok'd a tyrant's hate,<br/>
Incens'd the Libyan and the Tyrian state;<br/>
For you alone I suffer in my fame,<br/>
Bereft of honour, and expos'd to shame.<br/>
Whom have I now to trust, ungrateful guest?<br/>
(That only name remains of all the rest!)<br/>
What have I left? or whither can I fly?<br/>
Must I attend Pygmalion's cruelty,<br/>
Or till Hyarba shall in triumph lead<br/>
A queen that proudly scorn'd his proffer'd bed?<br/>
Had you deferr'd, at least, your hasty flight,<br/>
And left behind some pledge of our delight,<br/>
Some babe to bless the mother's mournful sight,<br/>
Some young Aeneas, to supply your place,<br/>
Whose features might express his father's face;<br/>
I should not then complain to live bereft<br/>
Of all my husband, or be wholly left."
</p>
<p>
Here paus'd the queen. Unmov'd he holds his eyes,<br/>
By Jove's command; nor suffer'd love to rise,<br/>
Tho' heaving in his heart; and thus at length replies:<br/>
"Fair queen, you never can enough repeat<br/>
Your boundless favours, or I own my debt;<br/>
Nor can my mind forget Eliza's name,<br/>
While vital breath inspires this mortal frame.<br/>
This only let me speak in my defence:<br/>
I never hop'd a secret flight from hence,<br/>
Much less pretended to the lawful claim<br/>
Of sacred nuptials, or a husband's name.<br/>
For, if indulgent Heav'n would leave me free,<br/>
And not submit my life to fate's decree,<br/>
My choice would lead me to the Trojan shore,<br/>
Those relics to review, their dust adore,<br/>
And Priam's ruin'd palace to restore.<br/>
But now the Delphian oracle commands,<br/>
And fate invites me to the Latian lands.<br/>
That is the promis'd place to which I steer,<br/>
And all my vows are terminated there.<br/>
If you, a Tyrian, and a stranger born,<br/>
With walls and tow'rs a Libyan town adorn,<br/>
Why may not we, like you, a foreign race,<br/>
Like you, seek shelter in a foreign place?<br/>
As often as the night obscures the skies<br/>
With humid shades, or twinkling stars arise,<br/>
Anchises' angry ghost in dreams appears,<br/>
Chides my delay, and fills my soul with fears;<br/>
And young Ascanius justly may complain<br/>
Of his defrauded and destin'd reign.<br/>
Ev'n now the herald of the gods appear'd:<br/>
Waking I saw him, and his message heard.<br/>
From Jove he came commission'd, heav'nly bright<br/>
With radiant beams, and manifest to sight<br/>
(The sender and the sent I both attest)<br/>
These walls he enter'd, and those words express'd.<br/>
Fair queen, oppose not what the gods command;<br/>
Forc'd by my fate, I leave your happy land."
</p>
<p>
Thus while he spoke, already she began,<br/>
With sparkling eyes, to view the guilty man;<br/>
From head to foot survey'd his person o'er,<br/>
Nor longer these outrageous threats forebore:<br/>
"False as thou art, and, more than false, forsworn!<br/>
Not sprung from noble blood, nor goddess-born,<br/>
But hewn from harden'd entrails of a rock!<br/>
And rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck!<br/>
Why should I fawn? what have I worse to fear?<br/>
Did he once look, or lent a list'ning ear,<br/>
Sigh'd when I sobb'd, or shed one kindly tear?<br/>
All symptoms of a base ungrateful mind,<br/>
So foul, that, which is worse, 'tis hard to find.<br/>
Of man's injustice why should I complain?<br/>
The gods, and Jove himself, behold in vain<br/>
Triumphant treason; yet no thunder flies,<br/>
Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes;<br/>
Faithless is earth, and faithless are the skies!<br/>
Justice is fled, and Truth is now no more!<br/>
I sav'd the shipwreck'd exile on my shore;<br/>
With needful food his hungry Trojans fed;<br/>
I took the traitor to my throne and bed:<br/>
Fool that I was—— 'tis little to repeat<br/>
The rest, I stor'd and rigg'd his ruin'd fleet.<br/>
I rave, I rave! A god's command he pleads,<br/>
And makes Heav'n accessary to his deeds.<br/>
Now Lycian lots, and now the Delian god,<br/>
Now Hermes is employ'd from Jove's abode,<br/>
To warn him hence; as if the peaceful state<br/>
Of heav'nly pow'rs were touch'd with human fate!<br/>
But go! thy flight no longer I detain;<br/>
Go seek thy promis'd kingdom thro' the main!<br/>
Yet, if the heav'ns will hear my pious vow,<br/>
The faithless waves, not half so false as thou,<br/>
Or secret sands, shall sepulchers afford<br/>
To thy proud vessels, and their perjur'd lord.<br/>
Then shalt thou call on injur'd Dido's name:<br/>
Dido shall come in a black sulph'ry flame,<br/>
When death has once dissolv'd her mortal frame;<br/>
Shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep:<br/>
Her angry ghost, arising from the deep,<br/>
Shall haunt thee waking, and disturb thy sleep.<br/>
At least my shade thy punishment shall know,<br/>
And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below."
</p>
<p>
Abruptly here she stops; then turns away<br/>
Her loathing eyes, and shuns the sight of day.<br/>
Amaz'd he stood, revolving in his mind<br/>
What speech to frame, and what excuse to find.<br/>
Her fearful maids their fainting mistress led,<br/>
And softly laid her on her ivory bed.
</p>
<p>
But good Aeneas, tho' he much desir'd<br/>
To give that pity which her grief requir'd;<br/>
Tho' much he mourn'd, and labour'd with his love,<br/>
Resolv'd at length, obeys the will of Jove;<br/>
Reviews his forces: they with early care<br/>
Unmoor their vessels, and for sea prepare.<br/>
The fleet is soon afloat, in all its pride,<br/>
And well-calk'd galleys in the harbour ride.<br/>
Then oaks for oars they fell'd; or, as they stood,<br/>
Of its green arms despoil'd the growing wood,<br/>
Studious of flight. The beach is cover'd o'er<br/>
With Trojan bands, that blacken all the shore:<br/>
On ev'ry side are seen, descending down,<br/>
Thick swarms of soldiers, loaden from the town.<br/>
Thus, in battalia, march embodied ants,<br/>
Fearful of winter, and of future wants,<br/>
T' invade the corn, and to their cells convey<br/>
The plunder'd forage of their yellow prey.<br/>
The sable troops, along the narrow tracks,<br/>
Scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs:<br/>
Some set their shoulders to the pond'rous grain;<br/>
Some guard the spoil; some lash the lagging train;<br/>
All ply their sev'ral tasks, and equal toil sustain.
</p>
<p>
What pangs the tender breast of Dido tore,<br/>
When, from the tow'r, she saw the cover'd shore,<br/>
And heard the shouts of sailors from afar,<br/>
Mix'd with the murmurs of the wat'ry war!<br/>
All-pow'rful Love! what changes canst thou cause<br/>
In human hearts, subjected to thy laws!<br/>
Once more her haughty soul the tyrant bends:<br/>
To pray'rs and mean submissions she descends.<br/>
No female arts or aids she left untried,<br/>
Nor counsels unexplor'd, before she died.<br/>
"Look, Anna! look! the Trojans crowd to sea;<br/>
They spread their canvas, and their anchors weigh.<br/>
The shouting crew their ships with garlands bind,<br/>
Invoke the sea gods, and invite the wind.<br/>
Could I have thought this threat'ning blow so near,<br/>
My tender soul had been forewarn'd to bear.<br/>
But do not you my last request deny;<br/>
With yon perfidious man your int'rest try,<br/>
And bring me news, if I must live or die.<br/>
You are his fav'rite; you alone can find<br/>
The dark recesses of his inmost mind:<br/>
In all his trusted secrets you have part,<br/>
And know the soft approaches to his heart.<br/>
Haste then, and humbly seek my haughty foe;<br/>
Tell him, I did not with the Grecians go,<br/>
Nor did my fleet against his friends employ,<br/>
Nor swore the ruin of unhappy Troy,<br/>
Nor mov'd with hands profane his father's dust:<br/>
Why should he then reject a suit so just!<br/>
Whom does he shun, and whither would he fly!<br/>
Can he this last, this only pray'r deny!<br/>
Let him at least his dang'rous flight delay,<br/>
Wait better winds, and hope a calmer sea.<br/>
The nuptials he disclaims I urge no more:<br/>
Let him pursue the promis'd Latian shore.<br/>
A short delay is all I ask him now;<br/>
A pause of grief, an interval from woe,<br/>
Till my soft soul be temper'd to sustain<br/>
Accustom'd sorrows, and inur'd to pain.<br/>
If you in pity grant this one request,<br/>
My death shall glut the hatred of his breast."<br/>
This mournful message pious Anna bears,<br/>
And seconds with her own her sister's tears:<br/>
But all her arts are still employ'd in vain;<br/>
Again she comes, and is refus'd again.<br/>
His harden'd heart nor pray'rs nor threat'nings move;<br/>
Fate, and the god, had stopp'd his ears to love.
</p>
<p>
As, when the winds their airy quarrel try,<br/>
Justling from ev'ry quarter of the sky,<br/>
This way and that the mountain oak they bend,<br/>
His boughs they shatter, and his branches rend;<br/>
With leaves and falling mast they spread the ground;<br/>
The hollow valleys echo to the sound:<br/>
Unmov'd, the royal plant their fury mocks,<br/>
Or, shaken, clings more closely to the rocks;<br/>
Far as he shoots his tow'ring head on high,<br/>
So deep in earth his fix'd foundations lie.<br/>
No less a storm the Trojan hero bears;<br/>
Thick messages and loud complaints he hears,<br/>
And bandied words, still beating on his ears.<br/>
Sighs, groans, and tears proclaim his inward pains;<br/>
But the firm purpose of his heart remains.
</p>
<p>
The wretched queen, pursued by cruel fate,<br/>
Begins at length the light of heav'n to hate,<br/>
And loathes to live. Then dire portents she sees,<br/>
To hasten on the death her soul decrees:<br/>
Strange to relate! for when, before the shrine,<br/>
She pours in sacrifice the purple wine,<br/>
The purple wine is turn'd to putrid blood,<br/>
And the white offer'd milk converts to mud.<br/>
This dire presage, to her alone reveal'd,<br/>
From all, and ev'n her sister, she conceal'd.<br/>
A marble temple stood within the grove,<br/>
Sacred to death, and to her murder'd love;<br/>
That honour'd chapel she had hung around<br/>
With snowy fleeces, and with garlands crown'd:<br/>
Oft, when she visited this lonely dome,<br/>
Strange voices issued from her husband's tomb;<br/>
She thought she heard him summon her away,<br/>
Invite her to his grave, and chide her stay.<br/>
Hourly 'tis heard, when with a boding note<br/>
The solitary screech owl strains her throat,<br/>
And, on a chimney's top, or turret's height,<br/>
With songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night.<br/>
Besides, old prophecies augment her fears;<br/>
And stern Aeneas in her dreams appears,<br/>
Disdainful as by day: she seems, alone,<br/>
To wander in her sleep, thro' ways unknown,<br/>
Guideless and dark; or, in a desert plain,<br/>
To seek her subjects, and to seek in vain:<br/>
Like Pentheus, when, distracted with his fear,<br/>
He saw two suns, and double Thebes, appear;<br/>
Or mad Orestes, when his mother's ghost<br/>
Full in his face infernal torches toss'd,<br/>
And shook her snaky locks: he shuns the sight,<br/>
Flies o'er the stage, surpris'd with mortal fright;<br/>
The Furies guard the door and intercept his flight.
</p>
<p>
Now, sinking underneath a load of grief,<br/>
From death alone she seeks her last relief;<br/>
The time and means resolv'd within her breast,<br/>
She to her mournful sister thus address'd<br/>
(Dissembling hope, her cloudy front she clears,<br/>
And a false vigour in her eyes appears):<br/>
"Rejoice!" she said. "Instructed from above,<br/>
My lover I shall gain, or lose my love.<br/>
Nigh rising Atlas, next the falling sun,<br/>
Long tracts of Ethiopian climates run:<br/>
There a Massylian priestess I have found,<br/>
Honour'd for age, for magic arts renown'd:<br/>
Th' Hesperian temple was her trusted care;<br/>
'Twas she supplied the wakeful dragon's fare.<br/>
She poppy seeds in honey taught to steep,<br/>
Reclaim'd his rage, and sooth'd him into sleep.<br/>
She watch'd the golden fruit; her charms unbind<br/>
The chains of love, or fix them on the mind:<br/>
She stops the torrents, leaves the channel dry,<br/>
Repels the stars, and backward bears the sky.<br/>
The yawning earth rebellows to her call,<br/>
Pale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall.<br/>
Witness, ye gods, and thou my better part,<br/>
How loth I am to try this impious art!<br/>
Within the secret court, with silent care,<br/>
Erect a lofty pile, expos'd in air:<br/>
Hang on the topmost part the Trojan vest,<br/>
Spoils, arms, and presents, of my faithless guest.<br/>
Next, under these, the bridal bed be plac'd,<br/>
Where I my ruin in his arms embrac'd:<br/>
All relics of the wretch are doom'd to fire;<br/>
For so the priestess and her charms require."
</p>
<p>
Thus far she said, and farther speech forbears;<br/>
A mortal paleness in her face appears:<br/>
Yet the mistrustless Anna could not find<br/>
The secret fun'ral in these rites design'd;<br/>
Nor thought so dire a rage possess'd her mind.<br/>
Unknowing of a train conceal'd so well,<br/>
She fear'd no worse than when Sichaeus fell;<br/>
Therefore obeys. The fatal pile they rear,<br/>
Within the secret court, expos'd in air.<br/>
The cloven holms and pines are heap'd on high,<br/>
And garlands on the hollow spaces lie.<br/>
Sad cypress, vervain, yew, compose the wreath,<br/>
And ev'ry baleful green denoting death.<br/>
The queen, determin'd to the fatal deed,<br/>
The spoils and sword he left, in order spread,<br/>
And the man's image on the nuptial bed.
</p>
<p>
And now (the sacred altars plac'd around)<br/>
The priestess enters, with her hair unbound,<br/>
And thrice invokes the pow'rs below the ground.<br/>
Night, Erebus, and Chaos she proclaims,<br/>
And threefold Hecate, with her hundred names,<br/>
And three Dianas: next, she sprinkles round<br/>
With feign'd Avernian drops the hallow'd ground;<br/>
Culls hoary simples, found by Phoebe's light,<br/>
With brazen sickles reap'd at noon of night;<br/>
Then mixes baleful juices in the bowl,<br/>
And cuts the forehead of a newborn foal,<br/>
Robbing the mother's love. The destin'd queen<br/>
Observes, assisting at the rites obscene;<br/>
A leaven'd cake in her devoted hands<br/>
She holds, and next the highest altar stands:<br/>
One tender foot was shod, her other bare;<br/>
Girt was her gather'd gown, and loose her hair.<br/>
Thus dress'd, she summon'd, with her dying breath,<br/>
The heav'ns and planets conscious of her death,<br/>
And ev'ry pow'r, if any rules above,<br/>
Who minds, or who revenges, injur'd love.
</p>
<p>
'Twas dead of night, when weary bodies close<br/>
Their eyes in balmy sleep and soft repose:<br/>
The winds no longer whisper thro' the woods,<br/>
Nor murm'ring tides disturb the gentle floods.<br/>
The stars in silent order mov'd around;<br/>
And Peace, with downy wings, was brooding on the ground<br/>
The flocks and herds, and party-colour'd fowl,<br/>
Which haunt the woods, or swim the weedy pool,<br/>
Stretch'd on the quiet earth, securely lay,<br/>
Forgetting the past labours of the day.<br/>
All else of nature's common gift partake:<br/>
Unhappy Dido was alone awake.<br/>
Nor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find;<br/>
Sleep fled her eyes, as quiet fled her mind.<br/>
Despair, and rage, and love divide her heart;<br/>
Despair and rage had some, but love the greater part.
</p>
<p>
Then thus she said within her secret mind:<br/>
"What shall I do? what succour can I find?<br/>
Become a suppliant to Hyarba's pride,<br/>
And take my turn, to court and be denied?<br/>
Shall I with this ungrateful Trojan go,<br/>
Forsake an empire, and attend a foe?<br/>
Himself I refug'd, and his train reliev'd;<br/>
'Tis true; but am I sure to be receiv'd?<br/>
Can gratitude in Trojan souls have place!<br/>
Laomedon still lives in all his race!<br/>
Then, shall I seek alone the churlish crew,<br/>
Or with my fleet their flying sails pursue?<br/>
What force have I but those whom scarce before<br/>
I drew reluctant from their native shore?<br/>
Will they again embark at my desire,<br/>
Once more sustain the seas, and quit their second Tyre?<br/>
Rather with steel thy guilty breast invade,<br/>
And take the fortune thou thyself hast made.<br/>
Your pity, sister, first seduc'd my mind,<br/>
Or seconded too well what I design'd.<br/>
These dear-bought pleasures had I never known,<br/>
Had I continued free, and still my own;<br/>
Avoiding love, I had not found despair,<br/>
But shar'd with salvage beasts the common air.<br/>
Like them, a lonely life I might have led,<br/>
Not mourn'd the living, nor disturb'd the dead."<br/>
These thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast.<br/>
On board, the Trojan found more easy rest.<br/>
Resolv'd to sail, in sleep he pass'd the night;<br/>
And order'd all things for his early flight.
</p>
<p>
To whom once more the winged god appears;<br/>
His former youthful mien and shape he wears,<br/>
And with this new alarm invades his ears:<br/>
"Sleep'st thou, O goddess-born! and canst thou drown<br/>
Thy needful cares, so near a hostile town,<br/>
Beset with foes; nor hear'st the western gales<br/>
Invite thy passage, and inspire thy sails?<br/>
She harbours in her heart a furious hate,<br/>
And thou shalt find the dire effects too late;<br/>
Fix'd on revenge, and obstinate to die.<br/>
Haste swiftly hence, while thou hast pow'r to fly.<br/>
The sea with ships will soon be cover'd o'er,<br/>
And blazing firebrands kindle all the shore.<br/>
Prevent her rage, while night obscures the skies,<br/>
And sail before the purple morn arise.<br/>
Who knows what hazards thy delay may bring?<br/>
Woman's a various and a changeful thing."<br/>
Thus Hermes in the dream; then took his flight<br/>
Aloft in air unseen, and mix'd with night.
</p>
<p>
Twice warn'd by the celestial messenger,<br/>
The pious prince arose with hasty fear;<br/>
Then rous'd his drowsy train without delay:<br/>
"Haste to your banks; your crooked anchors weigh,<br/>
And spread your flying sails, and stand to sea.<br/>
A god commands: he stood before my sight,<br/>
And urg'd us once again to speedy flight.<br/>
O sacred pow'r, what pow'r soe'er thou art,<br/>
To thy blest orders I resign my heart.<br/>
Lead thou the way; protect thy Trojan bands,<br/>
And prosper the design thy will commands."<br/>
He said: and, drawing forth his flaming sword,<br/>
His thund'ring arm divides the many-twisted cord.<br/>
An emulating zeal inspires his train:<br/>
They run; they snatch; they rush into the main.<br/>
With headlong haste they leave the desert shores,<br/>
And brush the liquid seas with lab'ring oars.
</p>
<p>
Aurora now had left her saffron bed,<br/>
And beams of early light the heav'ns o'erspread,<br/>
When, from a tow'r, the queen, with wakeful eyes,<br/>
Saw day point upward from the rosy skies.<br/>
She look'd to seaward; but the sea was void,<br/>
And scarce in ken the sailing ships descried.<br/>
Stung with despite, and furious with despair,<br/>
She struck her trembling breast, and tore her hair.<br/>
"And shall th' ungrateful traitor go," she said,<br/>
"My land forsaken, and my love betray'd?<br/>
Shall we not arm? not rush from ev'ry street,<br/>
To follow, sink, and burn his perjur'd fleet?<br/>
Haste, haul my galleys out! pursue the foe!<br/>
Bring flaming brands! set sail, and swiftly row!<br/>
What have I said? where am I? Fury turns<br/>
My brain; and my distemper'd bosom burns.<br/>
Then, when I gave my person and my throne,<br/>
This hate, this rage, had been more timely shown.<br/>
See now the promis'd faith, the vaunted name,<br/>
The pious man, who, rushing thro' the flame,<br/>
Preserv'd his gods, and to the Phrygian shore<br/>
The burthen of his feeble father bore!<br/>
I should have torn him piecemeal; strow'd in floods<br/>
His scatter'd limbs, or left expos'd in woods;<br/>
Destroy'd his friends and son; and, from the fire,<br/>
Have set the reeking boy before the sire.<br/>
Events are doubtful, which on battles wait:<br/>
Yet where's the doubt, to souls secure of fate?<br/>
My Tyrians, at their injur'd queen's command,<br/>
Had toss'd their fires amid the Trojan band;<br/>
At once extinguish'd all the faithless name;<br/>
And I myself, in vengeance of my shame,<br/>
Had fall'n upon the pile, to mend the fun'ral flame.<br/>
Thou Sun, who view'st at once the world below;<br/>
Thou Juno, guardian of the nuptial vow;<br/>
Thou Hecate hearken from thy dark abodes!<br/>
Ye Furies, fiends, and violated gods,<br/>
All pow'rs invok'd with Dido's dying breath,<br/>
Attend her curses and avenge her death!<br/>
If so the Fates ordain, Jove commands,<br/>
Th' ungrateful wretch should find the Latian lands,<br/>
Yet let a race untam'd, and haughty foes,<br/>
His peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose:<br/>
Oppress'd with numbers in th' unequal field,<br/>
His men discourag'd, and himself expell'd,<br/>
Let him for succour sue from place to place,<br/>
Torn from his subjects, and his son's embrace.<br/>
First, let him see his friends in battle slain,<br/>
And their untimely fate lament in vain;<br/>
And when, at length, the cruel war shall cease,<br/>
On hard conditions may he buy his peace:<br/>
Nor let him then enjoy supreme command;<br/>
But fall, untimely, by some hostile hand,<br/>
And lie unburied on the barren sand!<br/>
These are my pray'rs, and this my dying will;<br/>
And you, my Tyrians, ev'ry curse fulfil.<br/>
Perpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim,<br/>
Against the prince, the people, and the name.<br/>
These grateful off'rings on my grave bestow;<br/>
Nor league, nor love, the hostile nations know!<br/>
Now, and from hence, in ev'ry future age,<br/>
When rage excites your arms, and strength supplies the rage<br/>
Rise some avenger of our Libyan blood,<br/>
With fire and sword pursue the perjur'd brood;<br/>
Our arms, our seas, our shores, oppos'd to theirs;<br/>
And the same hate descend on all our heirs!"
</p>
<p>
This said, within her anxious mind she weighs<br/>
The means of cutting short her odious days.<br/>
Then to Sichaeus' nurse she briefly said<br/>
(For, when she left her country, hers was dead):<br/>
"Go, Barce, call my sister. Let her care<br/>
The solemn rites of sacrifice prepare;<br/>
The sheep, and all th' atoning off'rings bring,<br/>
Sprinkling her body from the crystal spring<br/>
With living drops; then let her come, and thou<br/>
With sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow.<br/>
Thus will I pay my vows to Stygian Jove,<br/>
And end the cares of my disastrous love;<br/>
Then cast the Trojan image on the fire,<br/>
And, as that burns, my passions shall expire."
</p>
<p>
The nurse moves onward, with officious care,<br/>
And all the speed her aged limbs can bear.<br/>
But furious Dido, with dark thoughts involv'd,<br/>
Shook at the mighty mischief she resolv'd.<br/>
With livid spots distinguish'd was her face;<br/>
Red were her rolling eyes, and discompos'd her pace;<br/>
Ghastly she gaz'd, with pain she drew her breath,<br/>
And nature shiver'd at approaching death.
</p>
<p>
Then swiftly to the fatal place she pass'd,<br/>
And mounts the fun'ral pile with furious haste;<br/>
Unsheathes the sword the Trojan left behind<br/>
(Not for so dire an enterprise design'd).<br/>
But when she view'd the garments loosely spread,<br/>
Which once he wore, and saw the conscious bed,<br/>
She paus'd, and with a sigh the robes embrac'd;<br/>
Then on the couch her trembling body cast,<br/>
Repress'd the ready tears, and spoke her last:<br/>
"Dear pledges of my love, while Heav'n so pleas'd,<br/>
Receive a soul, of mortal anguish eas'd:<br/>
My fatal course is finish'd; and I go,<br/>
A glorious name, among the ghosts below.<br/>
A lofty city by my hands is rais'd,<br/>
Pygmalion punish'd, and my lord appeas'd.<br/>
What could my fortune have afforded more,<br/>
Had the false Trojan never touch'd my shore!"<br/>
Then kiss'd the couch; and, "Must I die," she said,<br/>
"And unreveng'd? 'Tis doubly to be dead!<br/>
Yet ev'n this death with pleasure I receive:<br/>
On any terms, 'tis better than to live.<br/>
These flames, from far, may the false Trojan view;<br/>
These boding omens his base flight pursue!"
</p>
<p>
She said, and struck; deep enter'd in her side<br/>
The piercing steel, with reeking purple dyed:<br/>
Clogg'd in the wound the cruel weapon stands;<br/>
The spouting blood came streaming on her hands.<br/>
Her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke,<br/>
And with loud cries the sounding palace shook.<br/>
Distracted, from the fatal sight they fled,<br/>
And thro' the town the dismal rumour spread.<br/>
First from the frighted court the yell began;<br/>
Redoubled, thence from house to house it ran:<br/>
The groans of men, with shrieks, laments, and cries<br/>
Of mixing women, mount the vaulted skies.<br/>
Not less the clamour, than if ancient Tyre,<br/>
Or the new Carthage, set by foes on fire,<br/>
The rolling ruin, with their lov'd abodes,<br/>
Involv'd the blazing temples of their gods.
</p>
<p>
Her sister hears; and, furious with despair,<br/>
She beats her breast, and rends her yellow hair,<br/>
And, calling on Eliza's name aloud,<br/>
Runs breathless to the place, and breaks the crowd.<br/>
"Was all that pomp of woe for this prepar'd;<br/>
These fires, this fun'ral pile, these altars rear'd?<br/>
Was all this train of plots contriv'd," said she,<br/>
"All only to deceive unhappy me?<br/>
Which is the worst? Didst thou in death pretend<br/>
To scorn thy sister, or delude thy friend?<br/>
Thy summon'd sister, and thy friend, had come;<br/>
One sword had serv'd us both, one common tomb:<br/>
Was I to raise the pile, the pow'rs invoke,<br/>
Not to be present at the fatal stroke?<br/>
At once thou hast destroy'd thyself and me,<br/>
Thy town, thy senate, and thy colony!<br/>
Bring water; bathe the wound; while I in death<br/>
Lay close my lips to hers, and catch the flying breath."<br/>
This said, she mounts the pile with eager haste,<br/>
And in her arms the gasping queen embrac'd;<br/>
Her temples chaf'd; and her own garments tore,<br/>
To stanch the streaming blood, and cleanse the gore.<br/>
Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head,<br/>
And, fainting thrice, fell grov'ling on the bed;<br/>
Thrice op'd her heavy eyes, and sought the light,<br/>
But, having found it, sicken'd at the sight,<br/>
And clos'd her lids at last in endless night.
</p>
<p>
Then Juno, grieving that she should sustain<br/>
A death so ling'ring, and so full of pain,<br/>
Sent Iris down, to free her from the strife<br/>
Of lab'ring nature, and dissolve her life.<br/>
For since she died, not doom'd by Heav'n's decree,<br/>
Or her own crime, but human casualty,<br/>
And rage of love, that plung'd her in despair,<br/>
The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair,<br/>
Which Proserpine and they can only know;<br/>
Nor made her sacred to the shades below.<br/>
Downward the various goddess took her flight,<br/>
And drew a thousand colours from the light;<br/>
Then stood above the dying lover's head,<br/>
And said: "I thus devote thee to the dead.<br/>
This off'ring to th' infernal gods I bear."<br/>
Thus while she spoke, she cut the fatal hair:<br/>
The struggling soul was loos'd, and life dissolv'd in air.

<h1>Aeneid</h1>
<h2>by Virgil</h2>
<h3>Book II</h3>
<p>
All were attentive to the godlike man,<br/>
When from his lofty couch he thus began:<br/>
"Great queen, what you command me to relate<br/>
Renews the sad remembrance of our fate:<br/>
An empire from its old foundations rent,<br/>
And ev'ry woe the Trojans underwent;<br/>
A peopled city made a desert place;<br/>
All that I saw, and part of which I was:<br/>
Not ev'n the hardest of our foes could hear,<br/>
Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear.<br/>
And now the latter watch of wasting night,<br/>
And setting stars, to kindly rest invite;<br/>
But, since you take such int'rest in our woe,<br/>
And Troy's disastrous end desire to know,<br/>
I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell<br/>
What in our last and fatal night befell.
</p>
<p>
"By destiny compell'd, and in despair,<br/>
The Greeks grew weary of the tedious war,<br/>
And by Minerva's aid a fabric rear'd,<br/>
Which like a steed of monstrous height appear'd:<br/>
The sides were plank'd with pine; they feign'd it made<br/>
For their return, and this the vow they paid.<br/>
Thus they pretend, but in the hollow side<br/>
Selected numbers of their soldiers hide:<br/>
With inward arms the dire machine they load,<br/>
And iron bowels stuff the dark abode.<br/>
In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an isle<br/>
(While Fortune did on Priam's empire smile)<br/>
Renown'd for wealth; but, since, a faithless bay,<br/>
Where ships expos'd to wind and weather lay.<br/>
There was their fleet conceal'd. We thought, for Greece<br/>
Their sails were hoisted, and our fears release.<br/>
The Trojans, coop'd within their walls so long,<br/>
Unbar their gates, and issue in a throng,<br/>
Like swarming bees, and with delight survey<br/>
The camp deserted, where the Grecians lay:<br/>
The quarters of the sev'ral chiefs they show'd;<br/>
Here Phoenix, here Achilles, made abode;<br/>
Here join'd the battles; there the navy rode.<br/>
Part on the pile their wond'ring eyes employ:<br/>
The pile by Pallas rais'd to ruin Troy.<br/>
Thymoetes first ('tis doubtful whether hir'd,<br/>
Or so the Trojan destiny requir'd)<br/>
Mov'd that the ramparts might be broken down,<br/>
To lodge the monster fabric in the town.<br/>
But Capys, and the rest of sounder mind,<br/>
The fatal present to the flames designed,<br/>
Or to the wat'ry deep; at least to bore<br/>
The hollow sides, and hidden frauds explore.<br/>
The giddy vulgar, as their fancies guide,<br/>
With noise say nothing, and in parts divide.<br/>
Laocoon, follow'd by a num'rous crowd,<br/>
Ran from the fort, and cried, from far, aloud:<br/>
'O wretched countrymen! what fury reigns?<br/>
What more than madness has possess'd your brains?<br/>
Think you the Grecians from your coasts are gone?<br/>
And are Ulysses' arts no better known?<br/>
This hollow fabric either must inclose,<br/>
Within its blind recess, our secret foes;<br/>
Or 'tis an engine rais'd above the town,<br/>
T' o'erlook the walls, and then to batter down.<br/>
Somewhat is sure design'd, by fraud or force:<br/>
Trust not their presents, nor admit the horse.'<br/>
Thus having said, against the steed he threw<br/>
His forceful spear, which, hissing as it flew,<br/>
Pierc'd thro' the yielding planks of jointed wood,<br/>
And trembling in the hollow belly stood.<br/>
The sides, transpierc'd, return a rattling sound,<br/>
And groans of Greeks inclos'd come issuing thro' the wound<br/>
And, had not Heav'n the fall of Troy design'd,<br/>
Or had not men been fated to be blind,<br/>
Enough was said and done t'inspire a better mind.<br/>
Then had our lances pierc'd the treach'rous wood,<br/>
And Ilian tow'rs and Priam's empire stood.<br/>
Meantime, with shouts, the Trojan shepherds bring<br/>
A captive Greek, in bands, before the king;<br/>
Taken to take; who made himself their prey,<br/>
T' impose on their belief, and Troy betray;<br/>
Fix'd on his aim, and obstinately bent<br/>
To die undaunted, or to circumvent.<br/>
About the captive, tides of Trojans flow;<br/>
All press to see, and some insult the foe.<br/>
Now hear how well the Greeks their wiles disguis'd;<br/>
Behold a nation in a man compris'd.<br/>
Trembling the miscreant stood, unarm'd and bound;<br/>
He star'd, and roll'd his haggard eyes around,<br/>
Then said: 'Alas! what earth remains, what sea<br/>
Is open to receive unhappy me?<br/>
What fate a wretched fugitive attends,<br/>
Scorn'd by my foes, abandon'd by my friends?'<br/>
He said, and sigh'd, and cast a rueful eye:<br/>
Our pity kindles, and our passions die.<br/>
We cheer the youth to make his own defence,<br/>
And freely tell us what he was, and whence:<br/>
What news he could impart, we long to know,<br/>
And what to credit from a captive foe.
</p>
<p>
"His fear at length dismiss'd, he said: 'Whate'er<br/>
My fate ordains, my words shall be sincere:<br/>
I neither can nor dare my birth disclaim;<br/>
Greece is my country, Sinon is my name.<br/>
Tho' plung'd by Fortune's pow'r in misery,<br/>
'Tis not in Fortune's pow'r to make me lie.<br/>
If any chance has hither brought the name<br/>
Of Palamedes, not unknown to fame,<br/>
Who suffer'd from the malice of the times,<br/>
Accus'd and sentenc'd for pretended crimes,<br/>
Because these fatal wars he would prevent;<br/>
Whose death the wretched Greeks too late lament;<br/>
Me, then a boy, my father, poor and bare<br/>
Of other means, committed to his care,<br/>
His kinsman and companion in the war.<br/>
While Fortune favour'd, while his arms support<br/>
The cause, and rul'd the counsels, of the court,<br/>
I made some figure there; nor was my name<br/>
Obscure, nor I without my share of fame.<br/>
But when Ulysses, with fallacious arts,<br/>
Had made impression in the people's hearts,<br/>
And forg'd a treason in my patron's name<br/>
(I speak of things too far divulg'd by fame),<br/>
My kinsman fell. Then I, without support,<br/>
In private mourn'd his loss, and left the court.<br/>
Mad as I was, I could not bear his fate<br/>
With silent grief, but loudly blam'd the state,<br/>
And curs'd the direful author of my woes.<br/>
'Twas told again; and hence my ruin rose.<br/>
I threaten'd, if indulgent Heav'n once more<br/>
Would land me safely on my native shore,<br/>
His death with double vengeance to restore.<br/>
This mov'd the murderer's hate; and soon ensued<br/>
Th' effects of malice from a man so proud.<br/>
Ambiguous rumours thro' the camp he spread,<br/>
And sought, by treason, my devoted head;<br/>
New crimes invented; left unturn'd no stone,<br/>
To make my guilt appear, and hide his own;<br/>
Till Calchas was by force and threat'ning wrought:<br/>
But whyâ€”why dwell I on that anxious thought?<br/>
If on my nation just revenge you seek,<br/>
And 'tis t' appear a foe, t' appear a Greek;<br/>
Already you my name and country know;<br/>
Assuage your thirst of blood, and strike the blow:<br/>
My death will both the kingly brothers please,<br/>
And set insatiate Ithacus at ease.'<br/>
This fair unfinish'd tale, these broken starts,<br/>
Rais'd expectations in our longing hearts:<br/>
Unknowing as we were in Grecian arts.<br/>
His former trembling once again renew'd,<br/>
With acted fear, the villain thus pursued:
</p>
<p>
"'Long had the Grecians (tir'd with fruitless care,<br/>
And wearied with an unsuccessful war)<br/>
Resolv'd to raise the siege, and leave the town;<br/>
And, had the gods permitted, they had gone;<br/>
But oft the wintry seas and southern winds<br/>
Withstood their passage home, and chang'd their minds.<br/>
Portents and prodigies their souls amaz'd;<br/>
But most, when this stupendous pile was rais'd:<br/>
Then flaming meteors, hung in air, were seen,<br/>
And thunders rattled thro' a sky serene.<br/>
Dismay'd, and fearful of some dire event,<br/>
Eurypylus t' enquire their fate was sent.<br/>
He from the gods this dreadful answer brought:
</p>
<p>
"O Grecians, when the Trojan shores you sought,<br/>
Your passage with a virgin's blood was bought:<br/>
So must your safe return be bought again,<br/>
And Grecian blood once more atone the main."<br/>
The spreading rumour round the people ran;<br/>
All fear'd, and each believ'd himself the man.<br/>
Ulysses took th' advantage of their fright;<br/>
Call'd Calchas, and produc'd in open sight:<br/>
Then bade him name the wretch, ordain'd by fate<br/>
The public victim, to redeem the state.<br/>
Already some presag'd the dire event,<br/>
And saw what sacrifice Ulysses meant.<br/>
For twice five days the good old seer withstood<br/>
Th' intended treason, and was dumb to blood,<br/>
Till, tir'd, with endless clamours and pursuit<br/>
Of Ithacus, he stood no longer mute;<br/>
But, as it was agreed, pronounc'd that I<br/>
Was destin'd by the wrathful gods to die.<br/>
All prais'd the sentence, pleas'd the storm should fall<br/>
On one alone, whose fury threaten'd all.<br/>
The dismal day was come; the priests prepare<br/>
Their leaven'd cakes, and fillets for my hair.<br/>
I follow'd nature's laws, and must avow<br/>
I broke my bonds and fled the fatal blow.<br/>
Hid in a weedy lake all night I lay,<br/>
Secure of safety when they sail'd away.<br/>
But now what further hopes for me remain,<br/>
To see my friends, or native soil, again;<br/>
My tender infants, or my careful sire,<br/>
Whom they returning will to death require;<br/>
Will perpetrate on them their first design,<br/>
And take the forfeit of their heads for mine?<br/>
Which, O! if pity mortal minds can move,<br/>
If there be faith below, or gods above,<br/>
If innocence and truth can claim desert,<br/>
Ye Trojans, from an injur'd wretch avert.'
</p>
<p>
"False tears true pity move; the king commands<br/>
To loose his fetters, and unbind his hands:<br/>
Then adds these friendly words: 'Dismiss thy fears;<br/>
Forget the Greeks; be mine as thou wert theirs.<br/>
But truly tell, was it for force or guile,<br/>
Or some religious end, you rais'd the pile?'<br/>
Thus said the king. He, full of fraudful arts,<br/>
This well-invented tale for truth imparts:<br/>
'Ye lamps of heav'n!' he said, and lifted high<br/>
His hands now free, 'thou venerable sky!<br/>
Inviolable pow'rs, ador'd with dread!<br/>
Ye fatal fillets, that once bound this head!<br/>
Ye sacred altars, from whose flames I fled!<br/>
Be all of you adjur'd; and grant I may,<br/>
Without a crime, th' ungrateful Greeks betray,<br/>
Reveal the secrets of the guilty state,<br/>
And justly punish whom I justly hate!<br/>
But you, O king, preserve the faith you gave,<br/>
If I, to save myself, your empire save.<br/>
The Grecian hopes, and all th' attempts they made,<br/>
Were only founded on Minerva's aid.<br/>
But from the time when impious Diomede,<br/>
And false Ulysses, that inventive head,<br/>
Her fatal image from the temple drew,<br/>
The sleeping guardians of the castle slew,<br/>
Her virgin statue with their bloody hands<br/>
Polluted, and profan'd her holy bands;<br/>
From thence the tide of fortune left their shore,<br/>
And ebb'd much faster than it flow'd before:<br/>
Their courage languish'd, as their hopes decay'd;<br/>
And Pallas, now averse, refus'd her aid.<br/>
Nor did the goddess doubtfully declare<br/>
Her alter'd mind and alienated care.<br/>
When first her fatal image touch'd the ground,<br/>
She sternly cast her glaring eyes around,<br/>
That sparkled as they roll'd, and seem'd to threat:<br/>
Her heav'nly limbs distill'd a briny sweat.<br/>
Thrice from the ground she leap'd, was seen to wield<br/>
Her brandish'd lance, and shake her horrid shield.<br/>
Then Calchas bade our host for flight<br/>
And hope no conquest from the tedious war,<br/>
Till first they sail'd for Greece; with pray'rs besought<br/>
Her injur'd pow'r, and better omens brought.<br/>
And now their navy plows the wat'ry main,<br/>
Yet soon expect it on your shores again,<br/>
With Pallas pleas'd; as Calchas did ordain.<br/>
But first, to reconcile the blue-ey'd maid<br/>
For her stol'n statue and her tow'r betray'd,<br/>
Warn'd by the seer, to her offended name<br/>
We rais'd and dedicate this wondrous frame,<br/>
So lofty, lest thro' your forbidden gates<br/>
It pass, and intercept our better fates:<br/>
For, once admitted there, our hopes are lost;<br/>
And Troy may then a new Palladium boast;<br/>
For so religion and the gods ordain,<br/>
That, if you violate with hands profane<br/>
Minerva's gift, your town in flames shall burn,<br/>
(Which omen, O ye gods, on Grecia turn!)<br/>
But if it climb, with your assisting hands,<br/>
The Trojan walls, and in the city stands;<br/>
Then Troy shall Argos and Mycenae burn,<br/>
And the reverse of fate on us return.'
</p>
<p>
"With such deceits he gain'd their easy hearts,<br/>
Too prone to credit his perfidious arts.<br/>
What Diomede, nor Thetis' greater son,<br/>
A thousand ships, nor ten years' siege, had done:<br/>
False tears and fawning words the city won.
</p>
<p>
"A greater omen, and of worse portent,<br/>
Did our unwary minds with fear torment,<br/>
Concurring to produce the dire event.<br/>
Laocoon, Neptune's priest by lot that year,<br/>
With solemn pomp then sacrific'd a steer;<br/>
When, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied<br/>
Two serpents, rank'd abreast, the seas divide,<br/>
And smoothly sweep along the swelling tide.<br/>
Their flaming crests above the waves they show;<br/>
Their bellies seem to burn the seas below;<br/>
Their speckled tails advance to steer their course,<br/>
And on the sounding shore the flying billows force.<br/>
And now the strand, and now the plain they held;<br/>
Their ardent eyes with bloody streaks were fill'd;<br/>
Their nimble tongues they brandish'd as they came,<br/>
And lick'd their hissing jaws, that sputter'd flame.<br/>
We fled amaz'd; their destin'd way they take,<br/>
And to Laocoon and his children make;<br/>
And first around the tender boys they wind,<br/>
Then with their sharpen'd fangs their limbs and bodies grind.<br/>
The wretched father, running to their aid<br/>
With pious haste, but vain, they next invade;<br/>
Twice round his waist their winding volumes roll'd;<br/>
And twice about his gasping throat they fold.<br/>
The priest thus doubly chok'd, their crests divide,<br/>
And tow'ring o'er his head in triumph ride.<br/>
With both his hands he labours at the knots;<br/>
His holy fillets the blue venom blots;<br/>
His roaring fills the flitting air around.<br/>
Thus, when an ox receives a glancing wound,<br/>
He breaks his bands, the fatal altar flies,<br/>
And with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies.<br/>
Their tasks perform'd, the serpents quit their prey,<br/>
And to the tow'r of Pallas make their way:<br/>
Couch'd at her feet, they lie protected there<br/>
By her large buckler and protended spear.<br/>
Amazement seizes all; the gen'ral cry<br/>
Proclaims Laocoon justly doom'd to die,<br/>
Whose hand the will of Pallas had withstood,<br/>
And dared to violate the sacred wood.<br/>
All vote t' admit the steed, that vows be paid<br/>
And incense offer'd to th' offended maid.<br/>
A spacious breach is made; the town lies bare;<br/>
Some hoisting levers, some the wheels prepare<br/>
And fasten to the horse's feet; the rest<br/>
With cables haul along th' unwieldly beast.<br/>
Each on his fellow for assistance calls;<br/>
At length the fatal fabric mounts the walls,<br/>
Big with destruction. Boys with chaplets crown'd,<br/>
And choirs of virgins, sing and dance around.<br/>
Thus rais'd aloft, and then descending down,<br/>
It enters o'er our heads, and threats the town.<br/>
O sacred city, built by hands divine!<br/>
O valiant heroes of the Trojan line!<br/>
Four times he struck: as oft the clashing sound<br/>
Of arms was heard, and inward groans rebound.<br/>
Yet, mad with zeal, and blinded with our fate,<br/>
We haul along the horse in solemn state;<br/>
Then place the dire portent within the tow'r.<br/>
Cassandra cried, and curs'd th' unhappy hour;<br/>
Foretold our fate; but, by the god's decree,<br/>
All heard, and none believ'd the prophecy.<br/>
With branches we the fanes adorn, and waste,<br/>
In jollity, the day ordain'd to be the last.<br/>
Meantime the rapid heav'ns roll'd down the light,<br/>
And on the shaded ocean rush'd the night;<br/>
Our men, secure, nor guards nor sentries held,<br/>
But easy sleep their weary limbs compell'd.<br/>
The Grecians had embark'd their naval pow'rs<br/>
From Tenedos, and sought our well-known shores,<br/>
Safe under covert of the silent night,<br/>
And guided by th' imperial galley's light;<br/>
When Sinon, favour'd by the partial gods,<br/>
Unlock'd the horse, and op'd his dark abodes;<br/>
Restor'd to vital air our hidden foes,<br/>
Who joyful from their long confinement rose.<br/>
Tysander bold, and Sthenelus their guide,<br/>
And dire Ulysses down the cable slide:<br/>
Then Thoas, Athamas, and Pyrrhus haste;<br/>
Nor was the Podalirian hero last,<br/>
Nor injur'd Menelaus, nor the fam'd<br/>
Epeus, who the fatal engine fram'd.<br/>
A nameless crowd succeed; their forces join<br/>
T' invade the town, oppress'd with sleep and wine.<br/>
Those few they find awake first meet their fate;<br/>
Then to their fellows they unbar the gate.
</p>
<p>
"'Twas in the dead of night, when sleep repairs<br/>
Our bodies worn with toils, our minds with cares,<br/>
When Hector's ghost before my sight appears:<br/>
A bloody shroud he seem'd, and bath'd in tears;<br/>
Such as he was, when, by Pelides slain,<br/>
Thessalian coursers dragg'd him o'er the plain.<br/>
Swoln were his feet, as when the thongs were thrust<br/>
Thro' the bor'd holes; his body black with dust;<br/>
Unlike that Hector who return'd from toils<br/>
Of war, triumphant, in Aeacian spoils,<br/>
Or him who made the fainting Greeks retire,<br/>
And launch'd against their navy Phrygian fire.<br/>
His hair and beard stood stiffen'd with his gore;<br/>
And all the wounds he for his country bore<br/>
Now stream'd afresh, and with new purple ran.<br/>
I wept to see the visionary man,<br/>
And, while my trance continued, thus began:<br/>
'O light of Trojans, and support of Troy,<br/>
Thy father's champion, and thy country's joy!<br/>
O, long expected by thy friends! from whence<br/>
Art thou so late return'd for our defence?<br/>
Do we behold thee, wearied as we are<br/>
With length of labours, and with toils of war?<br/>
After so many fun'rals of thy own<br/>
Art thou restor'd to thy declining town?<br/>
But say, what wounds are these? What new disgrace<br/>
Deforms the manly features of thy face?'
</p>
<p>
"To this the spectre no reply did frame,<br/>
But answer'd to the cause for which he came,<br/>
And, groaning from the bottom of his breast,<br/>
This warning in these mournful words express'd:<br/>
'O goddess-born! escape, by timely flight,<br/>
The flames and horrors of this fatal night.<br/>
The foes already have possess'd the wall;<br/>
Troy nods from high, and totters to her fall.<br/>
Enough is paid to Priam's royal name,<br/>
More than enough to duty and to fame.<br/>
If by a mortal hand my father's throne<br/>
Could be defended, 'twas by mine alone.<br/>
Now Troy to thee commends her future state,<br/>
And gives her gods companions of thy fate:<br/>
From their assistance walls expect,<br/>
Which, wand'ring long, at last thou shalt erect.'<br/>
He said, and brought me, from their blest abodes,<br/>
The venerable statues of the gods,<br/>
With ancient Vesta from the sacred choir,<br/>
The wreaths and relics of th' immortal fire.
</p>
<p>
"Now peals of shouts come thund'ring from afar,<br/>
Cries, threats, and loud laments, and mingled war:<br/>
The noise approaches, tho' our palace stood<br/>
Aloof from streets, encompass'd with a wood.<br/>
Louder, and yet more loud, I hear th' alarms<br/>
Of human cries distinct, and clashing arms.<br/>
Fear broke my slumbers; I no longer stay,<br/>
But mount the terrace, thence the town survey,<br/>
And hearken what the frightful sounds convey.<br/>
Thus, when a flood of fire by wind is borne,<br/>
Crackling it rolls, and mows the standing corn;<br/>
Or deluges, descending on the plains,<br/>
Sweep o'er the yellow ear, destroy the pains<br/>
Of lab'ring oxen and the peasant's gains;<br/>
Unroot the forest oaks, and bear away<br/>
Flocks, folds, and trees, and undistinguish'd prey:<br/>
The shepherd climbs the cliff, and sees from far<br/>
The wasteful ravage of the wat'ry war.<br/>
Then Hector's faith was manifestly clear'd,<br/>
And Grecian frauds in open light appear'd.<br/>
The palace of Deiphobus ascends<br/>
In smoky flames, and catches on his friends.<br/>
Ucalegon burns next: the seas are bright<br/>
With splendour not their own, and shine with Trojan light.<br/>
New clamours and new clangours now arise,<br/>
The sound of trumpets mix'd with fighting cries.<br/>
With frenzy seiz'd, I run to meet th' alarms,<br/>
Resolv'd on death, resolv'd to die in arms,<br/>
But first to gather friends, with them t' oppose<br/>
If fortune favour'd, and repel the foes;<br/>
Spurr'd by my courage, by my country fir'd,<br/>
With sense of honour and revenge inspir'd.
</p>
<p>
"Pantheus, Apollo's priest, a sacred name,<br/>
Had scap'd the Grecian swords, and pass'd the flame:<br/>
With relics loaden, to my doors he fled,<br/>
And by the hand his tender grandson led.<br/>
'What hope, O Pantheus? whither can we run?<br/>
Where make a stand? and what may yet be done?'<br/>
Scarce had I said, when Pantheus, with a groan:<br/>
'Troy is no more, and Ilium was a town!<br/>
The fatal day, th' appointed hour, is come,<br/>
When wrathful Jove's irrevocable doom<br/>
Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands.<br/>
The fire consumes the town, the foe commands;<br/>
And armed hosts, an unexpected force,<br/>
Break from the bowels of the fatal horse.<br/>
Within the gates, proud Sinon throws about<br/>
The flames; and foes for entrance press without,<br/>
With thousand others, whom I fear to name,<br/>
More than from Argos or Mycenae came.<br/>
To sev'ral posts their parties they divide;<br/>
Some block the narrow streets, some scour the wide:<br/>
The bold they kill, th' unwary they surprise;<br/>
Who fights finds death, and death finds him who flies.<br/>
The warders of the gate but scarce maintain<br/>
Th' unequal combat, and resist in vain.'
</p>
<p>
"I heard; and Heav'n, that well-born souls inspires,<br/>
Prompts me thro' lifted swords and rising fires<br/>
To run where clashing arms and clamour calls,<br/>
And rush undaunted to defend the walls.<br/>
Ripheus and Iph'itas by my side engage,<br/>
For valour one renown'd, and one for age.<br/>
Dymas and Hypanis by moonlight knew<br/>
My motions and my mien, and to my party drew;<br/>
With young Coroebus, who by love was led<br/>
To win renown and fair Cassandra's bed,<br/>
And lately brought his troops to Priam's aid,<br/>
Forewarn'd in vain by the prophetic maid.<br/>
Whom when I saw resolv'd in arms to fall,<br/>
And that one spirit animated all:<br/>
'Brave souls!' said I, 'but brave, alas! in vain:<br/>
Come, finish what our cruel fates ordain.<br/>
You see the desp'rate state of our affairs,<br/>
And heav'n's protecting pow'rs are deaf to pray'rs.<br/>
The passive gods behold the Greeks defile<br/>
Their temples, and abandon to the spoil<br/>
Their own abodes: we, feeble few, conspire<br/>
To save a sinking town, involv'd in fire.<br/>
Then let us fall, but fall amidst our foes:<br/>
Despair of life the means of living shows.'<br/>
So bold a speech incourag'd their desire<br/>
Of death, and added fuel to their fire.
</p>
<p>
"As hungry wolves, with raging appetite,<br/>
Scour thro' the fields, nor fear the stormy night;<br/>
Their whelps at home expect the promis'd food,<br/>
And long to temper their dry chaps in blood:<br/>
So rush'd we forth at once; resolv'd to die,<br/>
Resolv'd, in death, the last extremes to try.<br/>
We leave the narrow lanes behind, and dare<br/>
Th' unequal combat in the public square:<br/>
Night was our friend; our leader was despair.<br/>
What tongue can tell the slaughter of that night?<br/>
What eyes can weep the sorrows and affright?<br/>
An ancient and imperial city falls:<br/>
The streets are fill'd with frequent funerals;<br/>
Houses and holy temples float in blood,<br/>
And hostile nations make a common flood.<br/>
Not only Trojans fall; but, in their turn,<br/>
The vanquish'd triumph, and the victors mourn.<br/>
Ours take new courage from despair and night:<br/>
Confus'd the fortune is, confus'd the fight.<br/>
All parts resound with tumults, plaints, and fears;<br/>
And grisly Death in sundry shapes appears.<br/>
Androgeos fell among us, with his band,<br/>
Who thought us Grecians newly come to land.<br/>
'From whence,' said he, 'my friends, this long delay?<br/>
You loiter, while the spoils are borne away:<br/>
Our ships are laden with the Trojan store;<br/>
And you, like truants, come too late ashore.'<br/>
He said, but soon corrected his mistake,<br/>
Found, by the doubtful answers which we make:<br/>
Amaz'd, he would have shunn'd th' unequal fight;<br/>
But we, more num'rous, intercept his flight.<br/>
As when some peasant, in a bushy brake,<br/>
Has with unwary footing press'd a snake;<br/>
He starts aside, astonish'd, when he spies<br/>
His rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes;<br/>
So from our arms surpris'd Androgeos flies.<br/>
In vain; for him and his we compass'd round,<br/>
Possess'd with fear, unknowing of the ground,<br/>
And of their lives an easy conquest found.<br/>
Thus Fortune on our first endeavor smil'd.<br/>
Coroebus then, with youthful hopes beguil'd,<br/>
Swoln with success, and a daring mind,<br/>
This new invention fatally design'd.<br/>
'My friends,' said he, 'since Fortune shows the way,<br/>
'Tis fit we should th' auspicious guide obey.<br/>
For what has she these Grecian arms bestow'd,<br/>
But their destruction, and the Trojans' good?<br/>
Then change we shields, and their devices bear:<br/>
Let fraud supply the want of force in war.<br/>
They find us arms.' This said, himself he dress'd<br/>
In dead Androgeos' spoils, his upper vest,<br/>
His painted buckler, and his plumy crest.<br/>
Thus Ripheus, Dymas, all the Trojan train,<br/>
Lay down their own attire, and strip the slain.<br/>
Mix'd with the Greeks, we go with ill presage,<br/>
Flatter'd with hopes to glut our greedy rage;<br/>
Unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet,<br/>
And strew with Grecian carcasses the street.<br/>
Thus while their straggling parties we defeat,<br/>
Some to the shore and safer ships retreat;<br/>
And some, oppress'd with more ignoble fear,<br/>
Remount the hollow horse, and pant in secret there.
</p>
<p>
"But, ah! what use of valour can be made,<br/>
When heav'n's propitious pow'rs refuse their aid!<br/>
Behold the royal prophetess, the fair<br/>
Cassandra, dragg'd by her dishevel'd hair,<br/>
Whom not Minerva's shrine, nor sacred bands,<br/>
In safety could protect from sacrilegious hands:<br/>
On heav'n she cast her eyes, she sigh'd, she cried,<br/>
('Twas all she could) her tender arms were tied.<br/>
So sad a sight Coroebus could not bear;<br/>
But, fir'd with rage, distracted with despair,<br/>
Amid the barb'rous ravishers he flew:<br/>
Our leader's rash example we pursue.<br/>
But storms of stones, from the proud temple's height,<br/>
Pour down, and on our batter'd helms alight:<br/>
We from our friends receiv'd this fatal blow,<br/>
Who thought us Grecians, as we seem'd in show.<br/>
They aim at the mistaken crests, from high;<br/>
And ours beneath the pond'rous ruin lie.<br/>
Then, mov'd with anger and disdain, to see<br/>
Their troops dispers'd, the royal virgin free,<br/>
The Grecians rally, and their pow'rs unite,<br/>
With fury charge us, and renew the fight.<br/>
The brother kings with Ajax join their force,<br/>
And the whole squadron of Thessalian horse.
</p>
<p>
"Thus, when the rival winds their quarrel try,<br/>
Contending for the kingdom of the sky,<br/>
South, east, and west, on airy coursers borne;<br/>
The whirlwind gathers, and the woods are torn:<br/>
Then Nereus strikes the deep; the billows rise,<br/>
And, mix'd with ooze and sand, pollute the skies.<br/>
The troops we squander'd first again appear<br/>
From several quarters, and enclose the rear.<br/>
They first observe, and to the rest betray,<br/>
Our diff'rent speech; our borrow'd arms survey.<br/>
Oppress'd with odds, we fall; Coroebus first,<br/>
At Pallas' altar, by Peneleus pierc'd.<br/>
Then Ripheus follow'd, in th' unequal fight;<br/>
Just of his word, observant of the right:<br/>
Heav'n thought not so. Dymas their fate attends,<br/>
With Hypanis, mistaken by their friends.<br/>
Nor, Pantheus, thee, thy mitre, nor the bands<br/>
Of awful Phoebus, sav'd from impious hands.<br/>
Ye Trojan flames, your testimony bear,<br/>
What I perform'd, and what I suffer'd there;<br/>
No sword avoiding in the fatal strife,<br/>
Expos'd to death, and prodigal of life;<br/>
Witness, ye heavens! I live not by my fault:<br/>
I strove to have deserv'd the death I sought.<br/>
But, when I could not fight, and would have died,<br/>
Borne off to distance by the growing tide,<br/>
Old Iphitus and I were hurried thence,<br/>
With Pelias wounded, and without defence.<br/>
New clamours from th' invested palace ring:<br/>
We run to die, or disengage the king.<br/>
So hot th' assault, so high the tumult rose,<br/>
While ours defend, and while the Greeks oppose<br/>
As all the Dardan and Argolic race<br/>
Had been contracted in that narrow space;<br/>
Or as all Ilium else were void of fear,<br/>
And tumult, war, and slaughter, only there.<br/>
Their targets in a tortoise cast, the foes,<br/>
Secure advancing, to the turrets rose:<br/>
Some mount the scaling ladders; some, more bold,<br/>
Swerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold;<br/>
Their left hand gripes their bucklers in th' ascent,<br/>
While with their right they seize the battlement.<br/>
From their demolish'd tow'rs the Trojans throw<br/>
Huge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe;<br/>
And heavy beams and rafters from the sides<br/>
(Such arms their last necessity provides)<br/>
And gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high,<br/>
The marks of state and ancient royalty.<br/>
The guards below, fix'd in the pass, attend<br/>
The charge undaunted, and the gate defend.<br/>
Renew'd in courage with recover'd breath,<br/>
A second time we ran to tempt our death,<br/>
To clear the palace from the foe, succeed<br/>
The weary living, and revenge the dead.
</p>
<p>
"A postern door, yet unobserv'd and free,<br/>
Join'd by the length of a blind gallery,<br/>
To the king's closet led: a way well known<br/>
To Hector's wife, while Priam held the throne,<br/>
Thro' which she brought Astyanax, unseen,<br/>
To cheer his grandsire and his grandsire's queen.<br/>
Thro' this we pass, and mount the tow'r, from whence<br/>
With unavailing arms the Trojans make defence.<br/>
From this the trembling king had oft descried<br/>
The Grecian camp, and saw their navy ride.<br/>
Beams from its lofty height with swords we hew,<br/>
Then, wrenching with our hands, th' assault renew;<br/>
And, where the rafters on the columns meet,<br/>
We push them headlong with our arms and feet.<br/>
The lightning flies not swifter than the fall,<br/>
Nor thunder louder than the ruin'd wall:<br/>
Down goes the top at once; the Greeks beneath<br/>
Are piecemeal torn, or pounded into death.<br/>
Yet more succeed, and more to death are sent;<br/>
We cease not from above, nor they below relent.<br/>
Before the gate stood Pyrrhus, threat'ning loud,<br/>
With glitt'ring arms conspicuous in the crowd.<br/>
So shines, renew'd in youth, the crested snake,<br/>
Who slept the winter in a thorny brake,<br/>
And, casting off his slough when spring returns,<br/>
Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns;<br/>
Restor'd with poisonous herbs, his ardent sides<br/>
Reflect the sun; and rais'd on spires he rides;<br/>
High o'er the grass, hissing he rolls along,<br/>
And brandishes by fits his forky tongue.<br/>
Proud Periphas, and fierce Automedon,<br/>
His father's charioteer, together run<br/>
To force the gate; the Scyrian infantry<br/>
Rush on in crowds, and the barr'd passage free.<br/>
Ent'ring the court, with shouts the skies they rend;<br/>
And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend.<br/>
Himself, among the foremost, deals his blows,<br/>
And with his ax repeated strokes bestows<br/>
On the strong doors; then all their shoulders ply,<br/>
Till from the posts the brazen hinges fly.<br/>
He hews apace; the double bars at length<br/>
Yield to his ax and unresisted strength.<br/>
A mighty breach is made: the rooms conceal'd<br/>
Appear, and all the palace is reveal'd;<br/>
The halls of audience, and of public state,<br/>
And where the lonely queen in secret sate.<br/>
Arm'd soldiers now by trembling maids are seen,<br/>
With not a door, and scarce a space, between.<br/>
The house is fill'd with loud laments and cries,<br/>
And shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies;<br/>
The fearful matrons run from place to place,<br/>
And kiss the thresholds, and the posts embrace.<br/>
The fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus plies,<br/>
And all his father sparkles in his eyes;<br/>
Nor bars, nor fighting guards, his force sustain:<br/>
The bars are broken, and the guards are slain.<br/>
In rush the Greeks, and all the apartments fill;<br/>
Those few defendants whom they find, they kill.<br/>
Not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood<br/>
Roars, when he finds his rapid course withstood;<br/>
Bears down the dams with unresisted sway,<br/>
And sweeps the cattle and the cots away.<br/>
These eyes beheld him when he march'd between<br/>
The brother kings: I saw th' unhappy queen,<br/>
The hundred wives, and where old Priam stood,<br/>
To stain his hallow'd altar with his brood.<br/>
The fifty nuptial beds (such hopes had he,<br/>
So large a promise, of a progeny),<br/>
The posts, of plated gold, and hung with spoils,<br/>
Fell the reward of the proud victor's toils.<br/>
Where'er the raging fire had left a space,<br/>
The Grecians enter and possess the place.
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps you may of Priam's fate enquire.<br/>
He, when he saw his regal town on fire,<br/>
His ruin'd palace, and his ent'ring foes,<br/>
On ev'ry side inevitable woes,<br/>
In arms, disus'd, invests his limbs, decay'd,<br/>
Like them, with age; a late and useless aid.<br/>
His feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain;<br/>
Loaded, not arm'd, he creeps along with pain,<br/>
Despairing of success, ambitious to be slain!<br/>
Uncover'd but by heav'n, there stood in view<br/>
An altar; near the hearth a laurel grew,<br/>
Dodder'd with age, whose boughs encompass round<br/>
The household gods, and shade the holy ground.<br/>
Here Hecuba, with all her helpless train<br/>
Of dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain.<br/>
Driv'n like a flock of doves along the sky,<br/>
Their images they hug, and to their altars fly.<br/>
The Queen, when she beheld her trembling lord,<br/>
And hanging by his side a heavy sword,<br/>
'What rage,' she cried, 'has seiz'd my husband's mind?<br/>
What arms are these, and to what use design'd?<br/>
These times want other aids! Were Hector here,<br/>
Ev'n Hector now in vain, like Priam, would appear.<br/>
With us, one common shelter thou shalt find,<br/>
Or in one common fate with us be join'd.'<br/>
She said, and with a last salute embrac'd<br/>
The poor old man, and by the laurel plac'd.<br/>
Behold! Polites, one of Priam's sons,<br/>
Pursued by Pyrrhus, there for safety runs.<br/>
Thro' swords and foes, amaz'd and hurt, he flies<br/>
Thro' empty courts and open galleries.<br/>
Him Pyrrhus, urging with his lance, pursues,<br/>
And often reaches, and his thrusts renews.<br/>
The youth, transfix'd, with lamentable cries,<br/>
Expires before his wretched parent's eyes:<br/>
Whom gasping at his feet when Priam saw,<br/>
The fear of death gave place to nature's law;<br/>
And, shaking more with anger than with age,<br/>
'The gods,' said he, 'requite thy brutal rage!<br/>
As sure they will, barbarian, sure they must,<br/>
If there be gods in heav'n, and gods be just:<br/>
Who tak'st in wrongs an insolent delight;<br/>
With a son's death t' infect a father's sight.<br/>
Not he, whom thou and lying fame conspire<br/>
To call thee his; not he, thy vaunted sire,<br/>
Thus us'd my wretched age: the gods he fear'd,<br/>
The laws of nature and of nations heard.<br/>
He cheer'd my sorrows, and, for sums of gold,<br/>
The bloodless carcass of my Hector sold;<br/>
Pitied the woes a parent underwent,<br/>
And sent me back in safety from his tent.'
</p>
<p>
"This said, his feeble hand a javelin threw,<br/>
Which, flutt'ring, seem'd to loiter as it flew:<br/>
Just, and but barely, to the mark it held,<br/>
And faintly tinkled on the brazen shield.
</p>
<p>
"Then Pyrrhus thus: 'Go thou from me to fate,<br/>
And to my father my foul deeds relate.<br/>
Now die!' With that he dragg'd the trembling sire,<br/>
Slidd'ring thro' clotter'd blood and holy mire,<br/>
(The mingled paste his murder'd son had made,)<br/>
Haul'd from beneath the violated shade,<br/>
And on the sacred pile the royal victim laid.<br/>
His right hand held his bloody falchion bare,<br/>
His left he twisted in his hoary hair;<br/>
Then, with a speeding thrust, his heart he found:<br/>
The lukewarm blood came rushing thro' the wound,<br/>
And sanguine streams distain'd the sacred ground.<br/>
Thus Priam fell, and shar'd one common fate<br/>
With Troy in ashes, and his ruin'd state:<br/>
He, who the scepter of all Asia sway'd,<br/>
Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey'd.<br/>
On the bleak shore now lies th' abandon'd king,<br/>
A headless carcass, and a nameless thing.
</p>
<p>
"Then, not before, I felt my curdled blood<br/>
Congeal with fear, my hair with horror stood:<br/>
My father's image fill'd my pious mind,<br/>
Lest equal years might equal fortune find.<br/>
Again I thought on my forsaken wife,<br/>
And trembled for my son's abandon'd life.<br/>
I look'd about, but found myself alone,<br/>
Deserted at my need! My friends were gone.<br/>
Some spent with toil, some with despair oppress'd,<br/>
Leap'd headlong from the heights; the flames consum'd the rest.<br/>
Thus, wand'ring in my way, without a guide,<br/>
The graceless Helen in the porch I spied<br/>
Of Vesta's temple; there she lurk'd alone;<br/>
Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown:<br/>
But, by the flames that cast their blaze around,<br/>
That common bane of Greece and Troy I found.<br/>
For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword;<br/>
More dreads the vengeance of her injur'd lord;<br/>
Ev'n by those gods who refug'd her abhorr'd.<br/>
Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard,<br/>
Resolv'd to give her guilt the due reward:<br/>
'Shall she triumphant sail before the wind,<br/>
And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind?<br/>
Shall she her kingdom and her friends review,<br/>
In state attended with a captive crew,<br/>
While unreveng'd the good old Priam falls,<br/>
And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls?<br/>
For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood<br/>
Were swell'd with bodies, and were drunk with blood?<br/>
'Tis true, a soldier can small honour gain,<br/>
And boast no conquest, from a woman slain:<br/>
Yet shall the fact not pass without applause,<br/>
Of vengeance taken in so just a cause;<br/>
The punish'd crime shall set my soul at ease,<br/>
And murm'ring manes of my friends appease.'<br/>
Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light<br/>
Spread o'er the place; and, shining heav'nly bright,<br/>
My mother stood reveal'd before my sight<br/>
Never so radiant did her eyes appear;<br/>
Not her own star confess'd a light so clear:<br/>
Great in her charms, as when on gods above<br/>
She looks, and breathes herself into their love.<br/>
She held my hand, the destin'd blow to break;<br/>
Then from her rosy lips began to speak:<br/>
'My son, from whence this madness, this neglect<br/>
Of my commands, and those whom I protect?<br/>
Why this unmanly rage? Recall to mind<br/>
Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind.<br/>
Look if your helpless father yet survive,<br/>
Or if Ascanius or Creusa live.<br/>
Around your house the greedy Grecians err;<br/>
And these had perish'd in the nightly war,<br/>
But for my presence and protecting care.<br/>
Not Helen's face, nor Paris, was in fault;<br/>
But by the gods was this destruction brought.<br/>
Now cast your eyes around, while I dissolve<br/>
The mists and films that mortal eyes involve,<br/>
Purge from your sight the dross, and make you see<br/>
The shape of each avenging deity.<br/>
Enlighten'd thus, my just commands fulfil,<br/>
Nor fear obedience to your mother's will.<br/>
Where yon disorder'd heap of ruin lies,<br/>
Stones rent from stones; where clouds of dust arise,<br/>
Amid that smother Neptune holds his place,<br/>
Below the wall's foundation drives his mace,<br/>
And heaves the building from the solid base.<br/>
Look where, in arms, imperial Juno stands<br/>
Full in the Scaean gate, with loud commands,<br/>
Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands.<br/>
See! Pallas, of her snaky buckler proud,<br/>
Bestrides the tow'r, refulgent thro' the cloud:<br/>
See! Jove new courage to the foe supplies,<br/>
And arms against the town the partial deities.<br/>
Haste hence, my son; this fruitless labour end:<br/>
Haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend:<br/>
Haste; and a mother's care your passage shall befriend.'<br/>
She said, and swiftly vanish'd from my sight,<br/>
Obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night.<br/>
I look'd, I listen'd; dreadful sounds I hear;<br/>
And the dire forms of hostile gods appear.<br/>
Troy sunk in flames I saw, nor could prevent;<br/>
And Ilium from its old foundations rent;<br/>
Rent like a mountain ash, which dar'd the winds,<br/>
And stood the sturdy strokes of lab'ring hinds.<br/>
About the roots the cruel ax resounds;<br/>
The stumps are pierc'd with oft-repeated wounds:<br/>
The war is felt on high; the nodding crown<br/>
Now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honours down.<br/>
To their united force it yields, tho' late,<br/>
And mourns with mortal groans th' approaching fate:<br/>
The roots no more their upper load sustain;<br/>
But down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro' the plain.
</p>
<p>
"Descending thence, I scape thro' foes and fire:<br/>
Before the goddess, foes and flames retire.<br/>
Arriv'd at home, he, for whose only sake,<br/>
Or most for his, such toils I undertake,<br/>
The good Anchises, whom, by timely flight,<br/>
I purpos'd to secure on Ida's height,<br/>
Refus'd the journey, resolute to die<br/>
And add his fun'rals to the fate of Troy,<br/>
Rather than exile and old age sustain.<br/>
'Go you, whose blood runs warm in ev'ry vein.<br/>
Had Heav'n decreed that I should life enjoy,<br/>
Heav'n had decreed to save unhappy Troy.<br/>
'Tis, sure, enough, if not too much, for one,<br/>
Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown.<br/>
Make haste to save the poor remaining crew,<br/>
And give this useless corpse a long adieu.<br/>
These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath;<br/>
At least the pitying foes will aid my death,<br/>
To take my spoils, and leave my body bare:<br/>
As for my sepulcher, let Heav'n take care.<br/>
'Tis long since I, for my celestial wife<br/>
Loath'd by the gods, have dragg'd a ling'ring life;<br/>
Since ev'ry hour and moment I expire,<br/>
Blasted from heav'n by Jove's avenging fire.'<br/>
This oft repeated, he stood fix'd to die:<br/>
Myself, my wife, my son, my family,<br/>
Intreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry.<br/>
'What, will he still persist, on death resolve,<br/>
And in his ruin all his house involve!'<br/>
He still persists his reasons to maintain;<br/>
Our pray'rs, our tears, our loud laments, are vain.
</p>
<p>
"Urg'd by despair, again I go to try<br/>
The fate of arms, resolv'd in fight to die:<br/>
'What hope remains, but what my death must give?<br/>
Can I, without so dear a father, live?<br/>
You term it prudence, what I baseness call:<br/>
Could such a word from such a parent fall?<br/>
If Fortune please, and so the gods ordain,<br/>
That nothing should of ruin'd Troy remain,<br/>
And you conspire with Fortune to be slain,<br/>
The way to death is wide, th' approaches near:<br/>
For soon relentless Pyrrhus will appear,<br/>
Reeking with Priam's blood: the wretch who slew<br/>
The son (inhuman) in the father's view,<br/>
And then the sire himself to the dire altar drew.<br/>
O goddess mother, give me back to Fate;<br/>
Your gift was undesir'd, and came too late!<br/>
Did you, for this, unhappy me convey<br/>
Thro' foes and fires, to see my house a prey?<br/>
Shall I my father, wife, and son behold,<br/>
Welt'ring in blood, each other's arms infold?<br/>
Haste! gird my sword, tho' spent and overcome:<br/>
'Tis the last summons to receive our doom.<br/>
I hear thee, Fate; and I obey thy call!<br/>
Not unreveng'd the foe shall see my fall.<br/>
Restore me to the yet unfinish'd fight:<br/>
My death is wanting to conclude the night.'<br/>
Arm'd once again, my glitt'ring sword I wield,<br/>
While th' other hand sustains my weighty shield,<br/>
And forth I rush to seek th' abandon'd field.<br/>
I went; but sad Creusa stopp'd my way,<br/>
And cross the threshold in my passage lay,<br/>
Embrac'd my knees, and, when I would have gone,<br/>
Shew'd me my feeble sire and tender son:<br/>
'If death be your design, at least,' said she,<br/>
'Take us along to share your destiny.<br/>
If any farther hopes in arms remain,<br/>
This place, these pledges of your love, maintain.<br/>
To whom do you expose your father's life,<br/>
Your son's, and mine, your now forgotten wife!'<br/>
While thus she fills the house with clam'rous cries,<br/>
Our hearing is diverted by our eyes:<br/>
For, while I held my son, in the short space<br/>
Betwixt our kisses and our last embrace;<br/>
Strange to relate, from young Iulus' head<br/>
A lambent flame arose, which gently spread<br/>
Around his brows, and on his temples fed.<br/>
Amaz'd, with running water we prepare<br/>
To quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair;<br/>
But old Anchises, vers'd in omens, rear'd<br/>
His hands to heav'n, and this request preferr'd:<br/>
'If any vows, almighty Jove, can bend<br/>
Thy will; if piety can pray'rs commend,<br/>
Confirm the glad presage which thou art pleas'd to send.'<br/>
Scarce had he said, when, on our left, we hear<br/>
A peal of rattling thunder roll in air:<br/>
There shot a streaming lamp along the sky,<br/>
Which on the winged lightning seem'd to fly;<br/>
From o'er the roof the blaze began to move,<br/>
And, trailing, vanish'd in th' Idaean grove.<br/>
It swept a path in heav'n, and shone a guide,<br/>
Then in a steaming stench of sulphur died.
</p>
<p>
"The good old man with suppliant hands implor'd<br/>
The gods' protection, and their star ador'd.<br/>
'Now, now,' said he, 'my son, no more delay!<br/>
I yield, I follow where Heav'n shews the way.<br/>
Keep, O my country gods, our dwelling place,<br/>
And guard this relic of the Trojan race,<br/>
This tender child! These omens are your own,<br/>
And you can yet restore the ruin'd town.<br/>
At least accomplish what your signs foreshow:<br/>
I stand resign'd, and am prepar'd to go.'
</p>
<p>
"He said. The crackling flames appear on high.<br/>
And driving sparkles dance along the sky.<br/>
With Vulcan's rage the rising winds conspire,<br/>
And near our palace roll the flood of fire.<br/>
'Haste, my dear father, ('tis no time to wait,)<br/>
And load my shoulders with a willing freight.<br/>
Whate'er befalls, your life shall be my care;<br/>
One death, or one deliv'rance, we will share.<br/>
My hand shall lead our little son; and you,<br/>
My faithful consort, shall our steps pursue.<br/>
Next, you, my servants, heed my strict commands:<br/>
Without the walls a ruin'd temple stands,<br/>
To Ceres hallow'd once; a cypress nigh<br/>
Shoots up her venerable head on high,<br/>
By long religion kept; there bend your feet,<br/>
And in divided parties let us meet.<br/>
Our country gods, the relics, and the bands,<br/>
Hold you, my father, in your guiltless hands:<br/>
In me 'tis impious holy things to bear,<br/>
Red as I am with slaughter, new from war,<br/>
Till in some living stream I cleanse the guilt<br/>
Of dire debate, and blood in battle spilt.'<br/>
Thus, ord'ring all that prudence could provide,<br/>
I clothe my shoulders with a lion's hide<br/>
And yellow spoils; then, on my bending back,<br/>
The welcome load of my dear father take;<br/>
While on my better hand Ascanius hung,<br/>
And with unequal paces tripp'd along.<br/>
Creusa kept behind; by choice we stray<br/>
Thro' ev'ry dark and ev'ry devious way.<br/>
I, who so bold and dauntless just before,<br/>
The Grecian darts and shock of lances bore,<br/>
At ev'ry shadow now am seiz'd with fear,<br/>
Not for myself, but for the charge I bear;<br/>
Till, near the ruin'd gate arriv'd at last,<br/>
Secure, and deeming all the danger past,<br/>
A frightful noise of trampling feet we hear.<br/>
My father, looking thro' the shades, with fear,<br/>
Cried out: 'Haste, haste, my son, the foes are nigh;<br/>
Their swords and shining armour I descry.'<br/>
Some hostile god, for some unknown offence,<br/>
Had sure bereft my mind of better sense;<br/>
For, while thro' winding ways I took my flight,<br/>
And sought the shelter of the gloomy night,<br/>
Alas! I lost Creusa: hard to tell<br/>
If by her fatal destiny she fell,<br/>
Or weary sate, or wander'd with affright;<br/>
But she was lost for ever to my sight.<br/>
I knew not, or reflected, till I meet<br/>
My friends, at Ceres' now deserted seat.<br/>
We met: not one was wanting; only she<br/>
Deceiv'd her friends, her son, and wretched me.
</p>
<p>
"What mad expressions did my tongue refuse!<br/>
Whom did I not, of gods or men, accuse!<br/>
This was the fatal blow, that pain'd me more<br/>
Than all I felt from ruin'd Troy before.<br/>
Stung with my loss, and raving with despair,<br/>
Abandoning my now forgotten care,<br/>
Of counsel, comfort, and of hope bereft,<br/>
My sire, my son, my country gods I left.<br/>
In shining armour once again I sheathe<br/>
My limbs, not feeling wounds, nor fearing death.<br/>
Then headlong to the burning walls I run,<br/>
And seek the danger I was forc'd to shun.<br/>
I tread my former tracks; thro' night explore<br/>
Each passage, ev'ry street I cross'd before.<br/>
All things were full of horror and affright,<br/>
And dreadful ev'n the silence of the night.<br/>
Then to my father's house I make repair,<br/>
With some small glimpse of hope to find her there.<br/>
Instead of her, the cruel Greeks I met;<br/>
The house was fill'd with foes, with flames beset.<br/>
Driv'n on the wings of winds, whole sheets of fire,<br/>
Thro' air transported, to the roofs aspire.<br/>
From thence to Priam's palace I resort,<br/>
And search the citadel and desert court.<br/>
Then, unobserv'd, I pass by Juno's church:<br/>
A guard of Grecians had possess'd the porch;<br/>
There Phoenix and Ulysses watch the prey,<br/>
And thither all the wealth of Troy convey:<br/>
The spoils which they from ransack'd houses brought,<br/>
And golden bowls from burning altars caught,<br/>
The tables of the gods, the purple vests,<br/>
The people's treasure, and the pomp of priests.<br/>
A rank of wretched youths, with pinion'd hands,<br/>
And captive matrons, in long order stands.<br/>
Then, with ungovern'd madness, I proclaim,<br/>
Thro' all the silent street, Creusa's name:<br/>
Creusa still I call; at length she hears,<br/>
And sudden thro' the shades of night appears.<br/>
Appears, no more Creusa, nor my wife,<br/>
But a pale spectre, larger than the life.<br/>
Aghast, astonish'd, and struck dumb with fear,<br/>
I stood; like bristles rose my stiffen'd hair.<br/>
Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief<br/>
'Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief.<br/>
Desist, my much-lov'd lord, t' indulge your pain;<br/>
You bear no more than what the gods ordain.<br/>
My fates permit me not from hence to fly;<br/>
Nor he, the great controller of the sky.<br/>
Long wand'ring ways for you the pow'rs decree;<br/>
On land hard labours, and a length of sea.<br/>
Then, after many painful years are past,<br/>
On Latium's happy shore you shall be cast,<br/>
Where gentle Tiber from his bed beholds<br/>
The flow'ry meadows, and the feeding folds.<br/>
There end your toils; and there your fates provide<br/>
A quiet kingdom, and a royal bride:<br/>
There fortune shall the Trojan line restore,<br/>
And you for lost Creusa weep no more.<br/>
Fear not that I shall watch, with servile shame,<br/>
Th' imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame;<br/>
Or, stooping to the victor's lust, disgrace<br/>
My goddess mother, or my royal race.<br/>
And now, farewell! The parent of the gods<br/>
Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes:<br/>
I trust our common issue to your care.'<br/>
She said, and gliding pass'd unseen in air.<br/>
I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue;<br/>
And thrice about her neck my arms I flung,<br/>
And, thrice deceiv'd, on vain embraces hung.<br/>
Light as an empty dream at break of day,<br/>
Or as a blast of wind, she rush'd away.
</p>
<p>
"Thus having pass'd the night in fruitless pain,<br/>
I to my longing friends return again,<br/>
Amaz'd th' augmented number to behold,<br/>
Of men and matrons mix'd, of young and old;<br/>
A wretched exil'd crew together brought,<br/>
With arms appointed, and with treasure fraught,<br/>
Resolv'd, and willing, under my command,<br/>
To run all hazards both of sea and land.<br/>
The Morn began, from Ida, to display<br/>
Her rosy cheeks; and Phosphor led the day:<br/>
Before the gates the Grecians took their post,<br/>
And all pretence of late relief was lost.<br/>
I yield to Fate, unwillingly retire,<br/>
And, loaded, up the hill convey my sire."

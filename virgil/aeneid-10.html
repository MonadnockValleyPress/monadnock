<h1>Aeneid</h1>
<h2>by Virgil</h2>
<h3>Book X</h3>
<p>
The gates of heav'n unfold: Jove summons all<br/>
The gods to council in the common hall.<br/>
Sublimely seated, he surveys from far<br/>
The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war,<br/>
And all th' inferior world. From first to last,<br/>
The sov'reign senate in degrees are plac'd.
</p>
<p>
Then thus th' almighty sire began: "Ye gods,<br/>
Natives or denizens of blest abodes,<br/>
From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind,<br/>
This backward fate from what was first design'd?<br/>
Why this protracted war, when my commands<br/>
Pronounc'd a peace, and gave the Latian lands?<br/>
What fear or hope on either part divides<br/>
Our heav'ns, and arms our powers on diff'rent sides?<br/>
A lawful time of war at length will come,<br/>
(Nor need your haste anticipate the doom),<br/>
When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome,<br/>
Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains,<br/>
And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains.<br/>
Then is your time for faction and debate,<br/>
For partial favour, and permitted hate.<br/>
Let now your immature dissension cease;<br/>
Sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace."
</p>
<p>
Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge;<br/>
But lovely Venus thus replies at large:<br/>
"O pow'r immense, eternal energy,<br/>
(For to what else protection can we fly?)<br/>
Seest thou the proud Rutulians, how they dare<br/>
In fields, unpunish'd, and insult my care?<br/>
How lofty Turnus vaunts amidst his train,<br/>
In shining arms, triumphant on the plain?<br/>
Ev'n in their lines and trenches they contend,<br/>
And scarce their walls the Trojan troops defend:<br/>
The town is fill'd with slaughter, and o'erfloats,<br/>
With a red deluge, their increasing moats.<br/>
Aeneas, ignorant, and far from thence,<br/>
Has left a camp expos'd, without defence.<br/>
This endless outrage shall they still sustain?<br/>
Shall Troy renew'd be forc'd and fir'd again?<br/>
A second siege my banish'd issue fears,<br/>
And a new Diomede in arms appears.<br/>
One more audacious mortal will be found;<br/>
And I, thy daughter, wait another wound.<br/>
Yet, if with fates averse, without thy leave,<br/>
The Latian lands my progeny receive,<br/>
Bear they the pains of violated law,<br/>
And thy protection from their aid withdraw.<br/>
But, if the gods their sure success foretell;<br/>
If those of heav'n consent with those of hell,<br/>
To promise Italy; who dare debate<br/>
The pow'r of Jove, or fix another fate?<br/>
What should I tell of tempests on the main,<br/>
Of Aeolus usurping Neptune's reign?<br/>
Of Iris sent, with Bacchanalian heat<br/>
T' inspire the matrons, and destroy the fleet?<br/>
Now Juno to the Stygian sky descends,<br/>
Solicits hell for aid, and arms the fiends.<br/>
That new example wanted yet above:<br/>
An act that well became the wife of Jove!<br/>
Alecto, rais'd by her, with rage inflames<br/>
The peaceful bosoms of the Latian dames.<br/>
Imperial sway no more exalts my mind;<br/>
(Such hopes I had indeed, while Heav'n was kind;)<br/>
Now let my happier foes possess my place,<br/>
Whom Jove prefers before the Trojan race;<br/>
And conquer they, whom you with conquest grace.<br/>
Since you can spare, from all your wide command,<br/>
No spot of earth, no hospitable land,<br/>
Which may my wand'ring fugitives receive;<br/>
(Since haughty Juno will not give you leave;)<br/>
Then, father, (if I still may use that name,)<br/>
By ruin'd Troy, yet smoking from the flame,<br/>
I beg you, let Ascanius, by my care,<br/>
Be freed from danger, and dismiss'd the war:<br/>
Inglorious let him live, without a crown.<br/>
The father may be cast on coasts unknown,<br/>
Struggling with fate; but let me save the son.<br/>
Mine is Cythera, mine the Cyprian tow'rs:<br/>
In those recesses, and those sacred bow'rs,<br/>
Obscurely let him rest; his right resign<br/>
To promis'd empire, and his Julian line.<br/>
Then Carthage may th' Ausonian towns destroy,<br/>
Nor fear the race of a rejected boy.<br/>
What profits it my son to scape the fire,<br/>
Arm'd with his gods, and loaded with his sire;<br/>
To pass the perils of the seas and wind;<br/>
Evade the Greeks, and leave the war behind;<br/>
To reach th' Italian shores; if, after all,<br/>
Our second Pergamus is doom'd to fall?<br/>
Much better had he curb'd his high desires,<br/>
And hover'd o'er his ill-extinguish'd fires.<br/>
To Simois' banks the fugitives restore,<br/>
And give them back to war, and all the woes before."
</p>
<p>
Deep indignation swell'd Saturnia's heart:<br/>
"And must I own," she said, "my secret smart—<br/>
What with more decence were in silence kept,<br/>
And, but for this unjust reproach, had slept?<br/>
Did god or man your fav'rite son advise,<br/>
With war unhop'd the Latians to surprise?<br/>
By fate, you boast, and by the gods' decree,<br/>
He left his native land for Italy!<br/>
Confess the truth; by mad Cassandra, more<br/>
Than Heav'n inspir'd, he sought a foreign shore!<br/>
Did I persuade to trust his second Troy<br/>
To the raw conduct of a beardless boy,<br/>
With walls unfinish'd, which himself forsakes,<br/>
And thro' the waves a wand'ring voyage takes?<br/>
When have I urg'd him meanly to demand<br/>
The Tuscan aid, and arm a quiet land?<br/>
Did I or Iris give this mad advice,<br/>
Or made the fool himself the fatal choice?<br/>
You think it hard, the Latians should destroy<br/>
With swords your Trojans, and with fires your Troy!<br/>
Hard and unjust indeed, for men to draw<br/>
Their native air, nor take a foreign law!<br/>
That Turnus is permitted still to live,<br/>
To whom his birth a god and goddess give!<br/>
But yet is just and lawful for your line<br/>
To drive their fields, and force with fraud to join;<br/>
Realms, not your own, among your clans divide,<br/>
And from the bridegroom tear the promis'd bride;<br/>
Petition, while you public arms prepare;<br/>
Pretend a peace, and yet provoke a war!<br/>
'Twas giv'n to you, your darling son to shroud,<br/>
To draw the dastard from the fighting crowd,<br/>
And, for a man, obtend an empty cloud.<br/>
From flaming fleets you turn'd the fire away,<br/>
And chang'd the ships to daughters of the sea.<br/>
But is my crime—the Queen of Heav'n offends,<br/>
If she presume to save her suff'ring friends!<br/>
Your son, not knowing what his foes decree,<br/>
You say, is absent: absent let him be.<br/>
Yours is Cythera, yours the Cyprian tow'rs,<br/>
The soft recesses, and the sacred bow'rs.<br/>
Why do you then these needless arms prepare,<br/>
And thus provoke a people prone to war?<br/>
Did I with fire the Trojan town deface,<br/>
Or hinder from return your exil'd race?<br/>
Was I the cause of mischief, or the man<br/>
Whose lawless lust the fatal war began?<br/>
Think on whose faith th' adult'rous youth relied;<br/>
Who promis'd, who procur'd, the Spartan bride?<br/>
When all th' united states of Greece combin'd,<br/>
To purge the world of the perfidious kind,<br/>
Then was your time to fear the Trojan fate:<br/>
Your quarrels and complaints are now too late."
</p>
<p>
Thus Juno. Murmurs rise, with mix'd applause,<br/>
Just as they favour or dislike the cause.<br/>
So winds, when yet unfledg'd in woods they lie,<br/>
In whispers first their tender voices try,<br/>
Then issue on the main with bellowing rage,<br/>
And storms to trembling mariners presage.
</p>
<p>
Then thus to both replied th' imperial god,<br/>
Who shakes heav'n's axles with his awful nod.<br/>
(When he begins, the silent senate stand<br/>
With rev'rence, list'ning to the dread command:<br/>
The clouds dispel; the winds their breath restrain;<br/>
And the hush'd waves lie flatted on the main.)<br/>
"Celestials, your attentive ears incline!<br/>
Since," said the god, "the Trojans must not join<br/>
In wish'd alliance with the Latian line;<br/>
Since endless jarrings and immortal hate<br/>
Tend but to discompose our happy state;<br/>
The war henceforward be resign'd to fate:<br/>
Each to his proper fortune stand or fall;<br/>
Equal and unconcern'd I look on all.<br/>
Rutulians, Trojans, are the same to me;<br/>
And both shall draw the lots their fates decree.<br/>
Let these assault, if Fortune be their friend;<br/>
And, if she favours those, let those defend:<br/>
The Fates will find their way." The Thund'rer said,<br/>
And shook the sacred honours of his head,<br/>
Attesting Styx, th' inviolable flood,<br/>
And the black regions of his brother god.<br/>
Trembled the poles of heav'n, and earth confess'd the nod.<br/>
This end the sessions had: the senate rise,<br/>
And to his palace wait their sov'reign thro' the skies.
</p>
<p>
Meantime, intent upon their siege, the foes<br/>
Within their walls the Trojan host inclose:<br/>
They wound, they kill, they watch at ev'ry gate;<br/>
Renew the fires, and urge their happy fate.
</p>
<p>
Th' Aeneans wish in vain their wanted chief,<br/>
Hopeless of flight, more hopeless of relief.<br/>
Thin on the tow'rs they stand; and ev'n those few<br/>
A feeble, fainting, and dejected crew.<br/>
Yet in the face of danger some there stood:<br/>
The two bold brothers of Sarpedon's blood,<br/>
Asius and Acmon; both th' Assaraci;<br/>
Young Haemon, and tho' young, resolv'd to die.<br/>
With these were Clarus and Thymoetes join'd;<br/>
Tibris and Castor, both of Lycian kind.<br/>
From Acmon's hands a rolling stone there came,<br/>
So large, it half deserv'd a mountain's name:<br/>
Strong-sinew'd was the youth, and big of bone;<br/>
His brother Mnestheus could not more have done,<br/>
Or the great father of th' intrepid son.<br/>
Some firebrands throw, some flights of arrows send;<br/>
And some with darts, and some with stones defend.
</p>
<p>
Amid the press appears the beauteous boy,<br/>
The care of Venus, and the hope of Troy.<br/>
His lovely face unarm'd, his head was bare;<br/>
In ringlets o'er his shoulders hung his hair.<br/>
His forehead circled with a diadem;<br/>
Distinguish'd from the crowd, he shines a gem,<br/>
Enchas'd in gold, or polish'd iv'ry set,<br/>
Amidst the meaner foil of sable jet.
</p>
<p>
Nor Ismarus was wanting to the war,<br/>
Directing pointed arrows from afar,<br/>
And death with poison arm'd—in Lydia born,<br/>
Where plenteous harvests the fat fields adorn;<br/>
Where proud Pactolus floats the fruitful lands,<br/>
And leaves a rich manure of golden sands.<br/>
There Capys, author of the Capuan name,<br/>
And there was Mnestheus too, increas'd in fame,<br/>
Since Turnus from the camp he cast with shame.
</p>
<p>
Thus mortal war was wag'd on either side.<br/>
Meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide:<br/>
For, anxious, from Evander when he went,<br/>
He sought the Tyrrhene camp, and Tarchon's tent;<br/>
Expos'd the cause of coming to the chief;<br/>
His name and country told, and ask'd relief;<br/>
Propos'd the terms; his own small strength declar'd;<br/>
What vengeance proud Mezentius had prepar'd:<br/>
What Turnus, bold and violent, design'd;<br/>
Then shew'd the slipp'ry state of humankind,<br/>
And fickle fortune; warn'd him to beware,<br/>
And to his wholesome counsel added pray'r.<br/>
Tarchon, without delay, the treaty signs,<br/>
And to the Trojan troops the Tuscan joins.
</p>
<p>
They soon set sail; nor now the fates withstand;<br/>
Their forces trusted with a foreign hand.<br/>
Aeneas leads; upon his stern appear<br/>
Two lions carv'd, which rising Ida bear—<br/>
Ida, to wand'ring Trojans ever dear.<br/>
Under their grateful shade Aeneas sate,<br/>
Revolving war's events, and various fate.<br/>
His left young Pallas kept, fix'd to his side,<br/>
And oft of winds enquir'd, and of the tide;<br/>
Oft of the stars, and of their wat'ry way;<br/>
And what he suffer'd both by land and sea.
</p>
<p>
Now, sacred sisters, open all your spring!<br/>
The Tuscan leaders, and their army sing,<br/>
Which follow'd great Aeneas to the war:<br/>
Their arms, their numbers, and their names declare.
</p>
<p>
A thousand youths brave Massicus obey,<br/>
Borne in the Tiger thro' the foaming sea;<br/>
From Asium brought, and Cosa, by his care:<br/>
For arms, light quivers, bows and shafts, they bear.<br/>
Fierce Abas next: his men bright armour wore;<br/>
His stern Apollo's golden statue bore.<br/>
Six hundred Populonia sent along,<br/>
All skill'd in martial exercise, and strong.<br/>
Three hundred more for battle Ilva joins,<br/>
An isle renown'd for steel, and unexhausted mines.<br/>
Asylas on his prow the third appears,<br/>
Who heav'n interprets, and the wand'ring stars;<br/>
From offer'd entrails prodigies expounds,<br/>
And peals of thunder, with presaging sounds.<br/>
A thousand spears in warlike order stand,<br/>
Sent by the Pisans under his command.
</p>
<p>
Fair Astur follows in the wat'ry field,<br/>
Proud of his manag'd horse and painted shield.<br/>
Gravisca, noisome from the neighb'ring fen,<br/>
And his own Caere, sent three hundred men;<br/>
With those which Minio's fields and Pyrgi gave,<br/>
All bred in arms, unanimous, and brave.
</p>
<p>
Thou, Muse, the name of Cinyras renew,<br/>
And brave Cupavo follow'd but by few;<br/>
Whose helm confess'd the lineage of the man,<br/>
And bore, with wings display'd, a silver swan.<br/>
Love was the fault of his fam'd ancestry,<br/>
Whose forms and fortunes in his ensigns fly.<br/>
For Cycnus lov'd unhappy Phaeton,<br/>
And sung his loss in poplar groves, alone,<br/>
Beneath the sister shades, to soothe his grief.<br/>
Heav'n heard his song, and hasten'd his relief,<br/>
And chang'd to snowy plumes his hoary hair,<br/>
And wing'd his flight, to chant aloft in air.<br/>
His son Cupavo brush'd the briny flood:<br/>
Upon his stern a brawny Centaur stood,<br/>
Who heav'd a rock, and, threat'ning still to throw,<br/>
With lifted hands alarm'd the seas below:<br/>
They seem'd to fear the formidable sight,<br/>
And roll'd their billows on, to speed his flight.
</p>
<p>
Ocnus was next, who led his native train<br/>
Of hardy warriors thro' the wat'ry plain:<br/>
The son of Manto by the Tuscan stream,<br/>
From whence the Mantuan town derives the name—<br/>
An ancient city, but of mix'd descent:<br/>
Three sev'ral tribes compose the government;<br/>
Four towns are under each; but all obey<br/>
The Mantuan laws, and own the Tuscan sway.
</p>
<p>
Hate to Mezentius arm'd five hundred more,<br/>
Whom Mincius from his sire Benacus bore:<br/>
Mincius, with wreaths of reeds his forehead cover'd o'er.<br/>
These grave Auletes leads: a hundred sweep<br/>
With stretching oars at once the glassy deep.<br/>
Him and his martial train the Triton bears;<br/>
High on his poop the sea-green god appears:<br/>
Frowning he seems his crooked shell to sound,<br/>
And at the blast the billows dance around.<br/>
A hairy man above the waist he shows;<br/>
A porpoise tail beneath his belly grows;<br/>
And ends a fish: his breast the waves divides,<br/>
And froth and foam augment the murm'ring tides.
</p>
<p>
Full thirty ships transport the chosen train<br/>
For Troy's relief, and scour the briny main.
</p>
<p>
Now was the world forsaken by the sun,<br/>
And Phoebe half her nightly race had run.<br/>
The careful chief, who never clos'd his eyes,<br/>
Himself the rudder holds, the sails supplies.<br/>
A choir of Nereids meet him on the flood,<br/>
Once his own galleys, hewn from Ida's wood;<br/>
But now, as many nymphs, the sea they sweep,<br/>
As rode, before, tall vessels on the deep.<br/>
They know him from afar; and in a ring<br/>
Enclose the ship that bore the Trojan king.<br/>
Cymodoce, whose voice excell'd the rest,<br/>
Above the waves advanc'd her snowy breast;<br/>
Her right hand stops the stern; her left divides<br/>
The curling ocean, and corrects the tides.<br/>
She spoke for all the choir, and thus began<br/>
With pleasing words to warn th' unknowing man:<br/>
"Sleeps our lov'd lord? O goddess-born, awake!<br/>
Spread ev'ry sail, pursue your wat'ry track,<br/>
And haste your course. Your navy once were we,<br/>
From Ida's height descending to the sea;<br/>
Till Turnus, as at anchor fix'd we stood,<br/>
Presum'd to violate our holy wood.<br/>
Then, loos'd from shore, we fled his fires profane<br/>
(Unwillingly we broke our master's chain),<br/>
And since have sought you thro' the Tuscan main.<br/>
The mighty Mother chang'd our forms to these,<br/>
And gave us life immortal in the seas.<br/>
But young Ascanius, in his camp distress'd,<br/>
By your insulting foes is hardly press'd.<br/>
Th' Arcadian horsemen, and Etrurian host,<br/>
Advance in order on the Latian coast:<br/>
To cut their way the Daunian chief designs,<br/>
Before their troops can reach the Trojan lines.<br/>
Thou, when the rosy morn restores the light,<br/>
First arm thy soldiers for th' ensuing fight:<br/>
Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield,<br/>
And bear aloft th' impenetrable shield.<br/>
Tomorrow's sun, unless my skill be vain,<br/>
Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain."<br/>
Parting, she spoke; and with immortal force<br/>
Push'd on the vessel in her wat'ry course;<br/>
For well she knew the way. Impell'd behind,<br/>
The ship flew forward, and outstripp'd the wind.<br/>
The rest make up. Unknowing of the cause,<br/>
The chief admires their speed, and happy omens draws.
</p>
<p>
Then thus he pray'd, and fix'd on heav'n his eyes:<br/>
"Hear thou, great Mother of the deities.<br/>
With turrets crown'd! (on Ida's holy hill<br/>
Fierce tigers, rein'd and curb'd, obey thy will.)<br/>
Firm thy own omens; lead us on to fight;<br/>
And let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right."
</p>
<p>
He said no more. And now renewing day<br/>
Had chas'd the shadows of the night away.<br/>
He charg'd the soldiers, with preventing care,<br/>
Their flags to follow, and their arms prepare;<br/>
Warn'd of th' ensuing fight, and bade 'em hope the war.<br/>
Now, his lofty poop, he view'd below<br/>
His camp incompass'd, and th' inclosing foe.<br/>
His blazing shield, imbrac'd, he held on high;<br/>
The camp receive the sign, and with loud shouts reply.<br/>
Hope arms their courage: from their tow'rs they throw<br/>
Their darts with double force, and drive the foe.<br/>
Thus, at the signal giv'n, the cranes arise<br/>
Before the stormy south, and blacken all the skies.
</p>
<p>
King Turnus wonder'd at the fight renew'd,<br/>
Till, looking back, the Trojan fleet he view'd,<br/>
The seas with swelling canvas cover'd o'er,<br/>
And the swift ships descending on the shore.<br/>
The Latians saw from far, with dazzled eyes,<br/>
The radiant crest that seem'd in flames to rise,<br/>
And dart diffusive fires around the field,<br/>
And the keen glitt'ring of the golden shield.<br/>
Thus threat'ning comets, when by night they rise,<br/>
Shoot sanguine streams, and sadden all the skies:<br/>
So Sirius, flashing forth sinister lights,<br/>
Pale humankind with plagues and with dry famine fright.
</p>
<p>
Yet Turnus with undaunted mind is bent<br/>
To man the shores, and hinder their descent,<br/>
And thus awakes the courage of his friends:<br/>
"What you so long have wish'd, kind Fortune sends;<br/>
In ardent arms to meet th' invading foe:<br/>
You find, and find him at advantage now.<br/>
Yours is the day: you need but only dare;<br/>
Your swords will make you masters of the war.<br/>
Your sires, your sons, your houses, and your lands,<br/>
And dearest wifes, are all within your hands.<br/>
Be mindful of the race from whence you came,<br/>
And emulate in arms your fathers' fame.<br/>
Now take the time, while stagg'ring yet they stand<br/>
With feet unfirm, and prepossess the strand:<br/>
Fortune befriends the bold." Nor more he said,<br/>
But balanc'd whom to leave, and whom to lead;<br/>
Then these elects, the landing to prevent;<br/>
And those he leaves, to keep the city pent.
</p>
<p>
Meantime the Trojan sends his troops ashore:<br/>
Some are by boats expos'd, by bridges more.<br/>
With lab'ring oars they bear along the strand,<br/>
Where the tide languishes, and leap a-land.<br/>
Tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes,<br/>
And, where no ford he finds, no water fries,<br/>
Nor billows with unequal murmurs roar,<br/>
But smoothly slide along, and swell the shore,<br/>
That course he steer'd, and thus he gave command:<br/>
"Here ply your oars, and at all hazard land:<br/>
Force on the vessel, that her keel may wound<br/>
This hated soil, and furrow hostile ground.<br/>
Let me securely land—I ask no more;<br/>
Then sink my ships, or shatter on the shore."
</p>
<p>
This fiery speech inflames his fearful friends:<br/>
They tug at ev'ry oar, and ev'ry stretcher bends;<br/>
They run their ships aground; the vessels knock,<br/>
(Thus forc'd ashore,) and tremble with the shock.<br/>
Tarchon's alone was lost, that stranded stood,<br/>
Stuck on a bank, and beaten by the flood:<br/>
She breaks her back; the loosen'd sides give way,<br/>
And plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea.<br/>
Their broken oars and floating planks withstand<br/>
Their passage, while they labour to the land,<br/>
And ebbing tides bear back upon th' uncertain sand.
</p>
<p>
Now Turnus leads his troops without delay,<br/>
Advancing to the margin of the sea.<br/>
The trumpets sound: Aeneas first assail'd<br/>
The clowns new-rais'd and raw, and soon prevail'd.<br/>
Great Theron fell, an omen of the fight;<br/>
Great Theron, large of limbs, of giant height.<br/>
He first in open field defied the prince:<br/>
But armour scal'd with gold was no defence<br/>
Against the fated sword, which open'd wide<br/>
His plated shield, and pierc'd his naked side.<br/>
Next, Lichas fell, who, not like others born,<br/>
Was from his wretched mother ripp'd and torn;<br/>
Sacred, O Phoebus, from his birth to thee;<br/>
For his beginning life from biting steel was free.<br/>
Not far from him was Gyas laid along,<br/>
Of monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and strong:<br/>
Vain bulk and strength! for, when the chief assail'd,<br/>
Nor valour nor Herculean arms avail'd,<br/>
Nor their fam'd father, wont in war to go<br/>
With great Alcides, while he toil'd below.<br/>
The noisy Pharos next receiv'd his death:<br/>
Aeneas writh'd his dart, and stopp'd his bawling breath.<br/>
Then wretched Cydon had receiv'd his doom,<br/>
Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom,<br/>
And sought with lust obscene polluted joys:<br/>
The Trojan sword had cur'd his love of boys,<br/>
Had not his sev'n bold brethren stopp'd the course<br/>
Of the fierce champions, with united force.<br/>
Sev'n darts were thrown at once; and some rebound<br/>
From his bright shield, some on his helmet sound:<br/>
The rest had reach'd him; but his mother's care<br/>
Prevented those, and turn'd aside in air.
</p>
<p>
The prince then call'd Achates, to supply<br/>
The spears that knew the way to victory—<br/>
"Those fatal weapons, which, inur'd to blood,<br/>
In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood:<br/>
Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain<br/>
Against our foes, on this contended plain."<br/>
He said; then seiz'd a mighty spear, and threw;<br/>
Which, wing'd with fate, thro' Maeon's buckler flew,<br/>
Pierc'd all the brazen plates, and reach'd his heart:<br/>
He stagger'd with intolerable smart.<br/>
Alcanor saw; and reach'd, but reach'd in vain,<br/>
His helping hand, his brother to sustain.<br/>
A second spear, which kept the former course,<br/>
From the same hand, and sent with equal force,<br/>
His right arm pierc'd, and holding on, bereft<br/>
His use of both, and pinion'd down his left.<br/>
Then Numitor from his dead brother drew<br/>
Th' ill-omen'd spear, and at the Trojan threw:<br/>
Preventing fate directs the lance awry,<br/>
Which, glancing, only mark'd Achates' thigh.
</p>
<p>
In pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came,<br/>
And, from afar, at Dryops took his aim.<br/>
The spear flew hissing thro' the middle space,<br/>
And pierc'd his throat, directed at his face;<br/>
It stopp'd at once the passage of his wind,<br/>
And the free soul to flitting air resign'd:<br/>
His forehead was the first that struck the ground;<br/>
Lifeblood and life rush'd mingled thro' the wound.<br/>
He slew three brothers of the Borean race,<br/>
And three, whom Ismarus, their native place,<br/>
Had sent to war, but all the sons of Thrace.<br/>
Halesus, next, the bold Aurunci leads:<br/>
The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds,<br/>
Conspicuous on his horse. On either hand,<br/>
These fight to keep, and those to win, the land.<br/>
With mutual blood th' Ausonian soil is dyed,<br/>
While on its borders each their claim decide.<br/>
As wintry winds, contending in the sky,<br/>
With equal force of lungs their titles try:<br/>
They rage, they roar; the doubtful rack of heav'n<br/>
Stands without motion, and the tide undriv'n:<br/>
Each bent to conquer, neither side to yield,<br/>
They long suspend the fortune of the field.<br/>
Both armies thus perform what courage can;<br/>
Foot set to foot, and mingled man to man.
</p>
<p>
But, in another part, th' Arcadian horse<br/>
With ill success engage the Latin force:<br/>
For, where th' impetuous torrent, rushing down,<br/>
Huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown,<br/>
They left their coursers, and, unus'd to fight<br/>
On foot, were scatter'd in a shameful flight.<br/>
Pallas, who with disdain and grief had view'd<br/>
His foes pursuing, and his friends pursued,<br/>
Us'd threat'nings mix'd with pray'rs, his last resource,<br/>
With these to move their minds, with those to fire their force<br/>
"Which way, companions? whether would you run?<br/>
By you yourselves, and mighty battles won,<br/>
By my great sire, by his establish'd name,<br/>
And early promise of my future fame;<br/>
By my youth, emulous of equal right<br/>
To share his honours—shun ignoble flight!<br/>
Trust not your feet: your hands must hew a way<br/>
Thro' yon black body, and that thick array:<br/>
'Tis thro' that forward path that we must come;<br/>
There lies our way, and that our passage home.<br/>
Nor pow'rs above, nor destinies below<br/>
Oppress our arms: with equal strength we go,<br/>
With mortal hands to meet a mortal foe.<br/>
See on what foot we stand: a scanty shore,<br/>
The sea behind, our enemies before;<br/>
No passage left, unless we swim the main;<br/>
Or, forcing these, the Trojan trenches gain."<br/>
This said, he strode with eager haste along,<br/>
And bore amidst the thickest of the throng.<br/>
Lagus, the first he met, with fate to foe,<br/>
Had heav'd a stone of mighty weight, to throw:<br/>
Stooping, the spear descended on his chine,<br/>
Just where the bone distinguished either loin:<br/>
It stuck so fast, so deeply buried lay,<br/>
That scarce the victor forc'd the steel away.<br/>
Hisbon came on: but, while he mov'd too slow<br/>
To wish'd revenge, the prince prevents his blow;<br/>
For, warding his at once, at once he press'd,<br/>
And plung'd the fatal weapon in his breast.<br/>
Then lewd Anchemolus he laid in dust,<br/>
Who stain'd his stepdam's bed with impious lust.<br/>
And, after him, the Daucian twins were slain,<br/>
Laris and Thymbrus, on the Latian plain;<br/>
So wondrous like in feature, shape, and size,<br/>
As caus'd an error in their parents' eyes—<br/>
Grateful mistake! but soon the sword decides<br/>
The nice distinction, and their fate divides:<br/>
For Thymbrus' head was lopp'd; and Laris' hand,<br/>
Dismember'd, sought its owner on the strand:<br/>
The trembling fingers yet the falchion strain,<br/>
And threaten still th' intended stroke in vain.
</p>
<p>
Now, to renew the charge, th' Arcadians came:<br/>
Sight of such acts, and sense of honest shame,<br/>
And grief, with anger mix'd, their minds inflame.<br/>
Then, with a casual blow was Rhoeteus slain,<br/>
Who chanc'd, as Pallas threw, to cross the plain:<br/>
The flying spear was after Ilus sent;<br/>
But Rhoeteus happen'd on a death unmeant:<br/>
From Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled,<br/>
The lance, athwart his body, laid him dead:<br/>
Roll'd from his chariot with a mortal wound,<br/>
And intercepted fate, he spurn'd the ground.<br/>
As when, in summer, welcome winds arise,<br/>
The watchful shepherd to the forest flies,<br/>
And fires the midmost plants; contagion spreads,<br/>
And catching flames infect the neighb'ring heads;<br/>
Around the forest flies the furious blast,<br/>
And all the leafy nation sinks at last,<br/>
And Vulcan rides in triumph o'er the waste;<br/>
The pastor, pleas'd with his dire victory,<br/>
Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky:<br/>
So Pallas' troops their scatter'd strength unite,<br/>
And, pouring on their foes, their prince delight.
</p>
<p>
Halesus came, fierce with desire of blood;<br/>
But first collected in his arms he stood:<br/>
Advancing then, he plied the spear so well,<br/>
Ladon, Demodocus, and Pheres fell.<br/>
Around his head he toss'd his glitt'ring brand,<br/>
And from Strymonius hew'd his better hand,<br/>
Held up to guard his throat; then hurl'd a stone<br/>
At Thoas' ample front, and pierc'd the bone:<br/>
It struck beneath the space of either eye;<br/>
And blood, and mingled brains, together fly.<br/>
Deep skill'd in future fates, Halesus' sire<br/>
Did with the youth to lonely groves retire:<br/>
But, when the father's mortal race was run,<br/>
Dire destiny laid hold upon the son,<br/>
And haul'd him to the war, to find, beneath<br/>
Th' Evandrian spear, a memorable death.<br/>
Pallas th' encounter seeks, but, ere he throws,<br/>
To Tuscan Tiber thus address'd his vows:<br/>
"O sacred stream, direct my flying dart,<br/>
And give to pass the proud Halesus' heart!<br/>
His arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear."<br/>
Pleas'd with the bribe, the god receiv'd his pray'r:<br/>
For, while his shield protects a friend distress'd,<br/>
The dart came driving on, and pierc'd his breast.
</p>
<p>
But Lausus, no small portion of the war,<br/>
Permits not panic fear to reign too far,<br/>
Caus'd by the death of so renown'd a knight;<br/>
But by his own example cheers the fight.<br/>
Fierce Abas first he slew; Abas, the stay<br/>
Of Trojan hopes, and hindrance of the day.<br/>
The Phrygian troops escap'd the Greeks in vain:<br/>
They, and their mix'd allies, now load the plain.<br/>
To the rude shock of war both armies came;<br/>
Their leaders equal, and their strength the same.<br/>
The rear so press'd the front, they could not wield<br/>
Their angry weapons, to dispute the field.<br/>
Here Pallas urges on, and Lausus there:<br/>
Of equal youth and beauty both appear,<br/>
But both by fate forbid to breathe their native air.<br/>
Their congress in the field great Jove withstands:<br/>
Both doom'd to fall, but fall by greater hands.
</p>
<p>
Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief<br/>
Of Lausus' danger, urging swift relief.<br/>
With his driv'n chariot he divides the crowd,<br/>
And, making to his friends, thus calls aloud:<br/>
"Let none presume his needless aid to join;<br/>
Retire, and clear the field; the fight is mine:<br/>
To this right hand is Pallas only due;<br/>
O were his father here, my just revenge to view!"<br/>
From the forbidden space his men retir'd.<br/>
Pallas their awe, and his stern words, admir'd;<br/>
Survey'd him o'er and o'er with wond'ring sight,<br/>
Struck with his haughty mien, and tow'ring height.<br/>
Then to the king: "Your empty vaunts forbear;<br/>
Success I hope, and fate I cannot fear;<br/>
Alive or dead, I shall deserve a name;<br/>
Jove is impartial, and to both the same."<br/>
He said, and to the void advanc'd his pace:<br/>
Pale horror sate on each Arcadian face.<br/>
Then Turnus, from his chariot leaping light,<br/>
Address'd himself on foot to single fight.<br/>
And, as a lion—when he spies from far<br/>
A bull that seems to meditate the war,<br/>
Bending his neck, and spurning back the sand—<br/>
Runs roaring downward from his hilly stand:<br/>
Imagine eager Turnus not more slow,<br/>
To rush from high on his unequal foe.
</p>
<p>
Young Pallas, when he saw the chief advance<br/>
Within due distance of his flying lance,<br/>
Prepares to charge him first, resolv'd to try<br/>
If fortune would his want of force supply;<br/>
And thus to Heav'n and Hercules address'd:<br/>
"Alcides, once on earth Evander's guest,<br/>
His son adjures you by those holy rites,<br/>
That hospitable board, those genial nights;<br/>
Assist my great attempt to gain this prize,<br/>
And let proud Turnus view, with dying eyes,<br/>
His ravish'd spoils." 'Twas heard, the vain request;<br/>
Alcides mourn'd, and stifled sighs within his breast.<br/>
Then Jove, to soothe his sorrow, thus began:<br/>
"Short bounds of life are set to mortal man.<br/>
'Tis virtue's work alone to stretch the narrow span.<br/>
So many sons of gods, in bloody fight,<br/>
Around the walls of Troy, have lost the light:<br/>
My own Sarpedon fell beneath his foe;<br/>
Nor I, his mighty sire, could ward the blow.<br/>
Ev'n Turnus shortly shall resign his breath,<br/>
And stands already on the verge of death."<br/>
This said, the god permits the fatal fight,<br/>
But from the Latian fields averts his sight.
</p>
<p>
Now with full force his spear young Pallas threw,<br/>
And, having thrown, his shining falchion drew<br/>
The steel just graz'd along the shoulder joint,<br/>
And mark'd it slightly with the glancing point,<br/>
Fierce Turnus first to nearer distance drew,<br/>
And pois'd his pointed spear, before he threw:<br/>
Then, as the winged weapon whizz'd along,<br/>
"See now," said he, "whose arm is better strung."<br/>
The spear kept on the fatal course, unstay'd<br/>
By plates of ir'n, which o'er the shield were laid:<br/>
Thro' folded brass and tough bull hides it pass'd,<br/>
His corslet pierc'd, and reach'd his heart at last.<br/>
In vain the youth tugs at the broken wood;<br/>
The soul comes issuing with the vital blood:<br/>
He falls; his arms upon his body sound;<br/>
And with his bloody teeth he bites the ground.
</p>
<p>
Turnus bestrode the corpse: "Arcadians, hear,"<br/>
Said he; "my message to your master bear:<br/>
Such as the sire deserv'd, the son I send;<br/>
It costs him dear to be the Phrygians' friend.<br/>
The lifeless body, tell him, I bestow,<br/>
Unask'd, to rest his wand'ring ghost below."<br/>
He said, and trampled down with all the force<br/>
Of his left foot, and spurn'd the wretched corse;<br/>
Then snatch'd the shining belt, with gold inlaid;<br/>
The belt Eurytion's artful hands had made,<br/>
Where fifty fatal brides, express'd to sight,<br/>
All in the compass of one mournful night,<br/>
Depriv'd their bridegrooms of returning light.
</p>
<p>
In an ill hour insulting Turnus tore<br/>
Those golden spoils, and in a worse he wore.<br/>
O mortals, blind in fate, who never know<br/>
To bear high fortune, or endure the low!<br/>
The time shall come, when Turnus, but in vain,<br/>
Shall wish untouch'd the trophies of the slain;<br/>
Shall wish the fatal belt were far away,<br/>
And curse the dire remembrance of the day.
</p>
<p>
The sad Arcadians, from th' unhappy field,<br/>
Bear back the breathless body on a shield.<br/>
O grace and grief of war! at once restor'd,<br/>
With praises, to thy sire, at once deplor'd!<br/>
One day first sent thee to the fighting field,<br/>
Beheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill'd;<br/>
One day beheld thee dead, and borne upon thy shield.<br/>
This dismal news, not from uncertain fame,<br/>
But sad spectators, to the hero came:<br/>
His friends upon the brink of ruin stand,<br/>
Unless reliev'd by his victorious hand.<br/>
He whirls his sword around, without delay,<br/>
And hews thro' adverse foes an ample way,<br/>
To find fierce Turnus, of his conquest proud:<br/>
Evander, Pallas, all that friendship ow'd<br/>
To large deserts, are present to his eyes;<br/>
His plighted hand, and hospitable ties.
</p>
<p>
Four sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred,<br/>
He took in fight, and living victims led,<br/>
To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire,<br/>
In sacrifice, before his fun'ral fire.<br/>
At Magus next he threw: he stoop'd below<br/>
The flying spear, and shunn'd the promis'd blow;<br/>
Then, creeping, clasp'd the hero's knees, and pray'd:<br/>
"By young Iulus, by thy father's shade,<br/>
O spare my life, and send me back to see<br/>
My longing sire, and tender progeny!<br/>
A lofty house I have, and wealth untold,<br/>
In silver ingots, and in bars of gold:<br/>
All these, and sums besides, which see no day,<br/>
The ransom of this one poor life shall pay.<br/>
If I survive, will Troy the less prevail?<br/>
A single soul's too light to turn the scale."<br/>
He said. The hero sternly thus replied:<br/>
"Thy bars and ingots, and the sums beside,<br/>
Leave for thy children's lot. Thy Turnus broke<br/>
All rules of war by one relentless stroke,<br/>
When Pallas fell: so deems, nor deems alone<br/>
My father's shadow, but my living son."<br/>
Thus having said, of kind remorse bereft,<br/>
He seiz'd his helm, and dragg'd him with his left;<br/>
Then with his right hand, while his neck he wreath'd,<br/>
Up to the hilts his shining falchion sheath'd.
</p>
<p>
Apollo's priest, Emonides, was near;<br/>
His holy fillets on his front appear;<br/>
Glitt'ring in arms, he shone amidst the crowd;<br/>
Much of his god, more of his purple, proud.<br/>
Him the fierce Trojan follow'd thro' the field:<br/>
The holy coward fell; and, forc'd to yield,<br/>
The prince stood o'er the priest, and, at one blow,<br/>
Sent him an off'ring to the shades below.<br/>
His arms Seresthus on his shoulders bears,<br/>
Design'd a trophy to the God of Wars.
</p>
<p>
Vulcanian Caeculus renews the fight,<br/>
And Umbro, born upon the mountains' height.<br/>
The champion cheers his troops t' encounter those,<br/>
And seeks revenge himself on other foes.<br/>
At Anxur's shield he drove; and, at the blow,<br/>
Both shield and arm to ground together go.<br/>
Anxur had boasted much of magic charms,<br/>
And thought he wore impenetrable arms,<br/>
So made by mutter'd spells; and, from the spheres,<br/>
Had life secur'd, in vain, for length of years.<br/>
Then Tarquitus the field in triumph trod;<br/>
A nymph his mother, his sire a god.<br/>
Exulting in bright arms, he braves the prince:<br/>
With his protended lance he makes defence;<br/>
Bears back his feeble foe; then, pressing on,<br/>
Arrests his better hand, and drags him down;<br/>
Stands o'er the prostrate wretch, and, as he lay,<br/>
Vain tales inventing, and prepar'd to pray,<br/>
Mows off his head: the trunk a moment stood,<br/>
Then sunk, and roll'd along the sand in blood.<br/>
The vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain:<br/>
"Lie there, proud man, unpitied, on the plain;<br/>
Lie there, inglorious, and without a tomb,<br/>
Far from thy mother and thy native home,<br/>
Exposed to savage beasts, and birds of prey,<br/>
Or thrown for food to monsters of the sea."
</p>
<p>
On Lycas and Antaeus next he ran,<br/>
Two chiefs of Turnus, and who led his van.<br/>
They fled for fear; with these, he chas'd along<br/>
Camers the yellow-lock'd, and Numa strong;<br/>
Both great in arms, and both were fair and young.<br/>
Camers was son to Volscens lately slain,<br/>
In wealth surpassing all the Latian train,<br/>
And in Amycla fix'd his silent easy reign.<br/>
And, as Aegaeon, when with heav'n he strove,<br/>
Stood opposite in arms to mighty Jove;<br/>
Mov'd all his hundred hands, provok'd the war,<br/>
Defied the forky lightning from afar;<br/>
At fifty mouths his flaming breath expires,<br/>
And flash for flash returns, and fires for fires;<br/>
In his right hand as many swords he wields,<br/>
And takes the thunder on as many shields:<br/>
With strength like his, the Trojan hero stood;<br/>
And soon the fields with falling corps were strow'd,<br/>
When once his falchion found the taste of blood.<br/>
With fury scarce to be conceiv'd, he flew<br/>
Against Niphaeus, whom four coursers drew.<br/>
They, when they see the fiery chief advance,<br/>
And pushing at their chests his pointed lance,<br/>
Wheel'd with so swift a motion, mad with fear,<br/>
They threw their master headlong from the chair.<br/>
They stare, they start, nor stop their course, before<br/>
They bear the bounding chariot to the shore.
</p>
<p>
Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains,<br/>
With two white steeds; but Liger holds the reins,<br/>
And Lucagus the lofty seat maintains:<br/>
Bold brethren both. The former wav'd in air<br/>
His flaming sword: Aeneas couch'd his spear,<br/>
Unus'd to threats, and more unus'd to fear.<br/>
Then Liger thus: "Thy confidence is vain<br/>
To scape from hence, as from the Trojan plain:<br/>
Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode,<br/>
Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode;<br/>
Nor Venus' veil is here, near Neptune's shield;<br/>
Thy fatal hour is come, and this the field."<br/>
Thus Liger vainly vaunts: the Trojan peer<br/>
Return'd his answer with his flying spear.<br/>
As Lucagus, to lash his horses, bends,<br/>
Prone to the wheels, and his left foot protends,<br/>
Prepar'd for fight; the fatal dart arrives,<br/>
And thro' the borders of his buckler drives;<br/>
Pass'd thro' and pierc'd his groin: the deadly wound,<br/>
Cast from his chariot, roll'd him on the ground.<br/>
Whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite:<br/>
"Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight;<br/>
Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat;<br/>
But you yourself forsake your empty seat."<br/>
He said, and seiz'd at once the loosen'd rein;<br/>
For Liger lay already on the plain,<br/>
By the same shock: then, stretching out his hands,<br/>
The recreant thus his wretched life demands:<br/>
"Now, by thyself, O more than mortal man!<br/>
By her and him from whom thy breath began,<br/>
Who form'd thee thus divine, I beg thee, spare<br/>
This forfeit life, and hear thy suppliant's pray'r."<br/>
Thus much he spoke, and more he would have said;<br/>
But the stern hero turn'd aside his head,<br/>
And cut him short: "I hear another man;<br/>
You talk'd not thus before the fight began.<br/>
Now take your turn; and, as a brother should,<br/>
Attend your brother to the Stygian flood."<br/>
Then thro' his breast his fatal sword he sent,<br/>
And the soul issued at the gaping vent.
</p>
<p>
As storms the skies, and torrents tear the ground,<br/>
Thus rag'd the prince, and scatter'd deaths around.<br/>
At length Ascanius and the Trojan train<br/>
Broke from the camp, so long besieg'd in vain.
</p>
<p>
Meantime the King of Gods and Mortal Man<br/>
Held conference with his queen, and thus began:<br/>
"My sister goddess, and well-pleasing wife,<br/>
Still think you Venus' aid supports the strife—<br/>
Sustains her Trojans—or themselves, alone,<br/>
With inborn valour force their fortune on?<br/>
How fierce in fight, with courage undecay'd!<br/>
Judge if such warriors want immortal aid."<br/>
To whom the goddess with the charming eyes,<br/>
Soft in her tone, submissively replies:<br/>
"Why, O my sov'reign lord, whose frown I fear,<br/>
And cannot, unconcern'd, your anger bear;<br/>
Why urge you thus my grief? when, if I still<br/>
(As once I was) were mistress of your will,<br/>
From your almighty pow'r your pleasing wife<br/>
Might gain the grace of length'ning Turnus' life,<br/>
Securely snatch him from the fatal fight,<br/>
And give him to his aged father's sight.<br/>
Now let him perish, since you hold it good,<br/>
And glut the Trojans with his pious blood.<br/>
Yet from our lineage he derives his name,<br/>
And, in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came;<br/>
Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine,<br/>
And offers daily incense at your shrine."
</p>
<p>
Then shortly thus the sov'reign god replied:<br/>
"Since in my pow'r and goodness you confide,<br/>
If for a little space, a lengthen'd span,<br/>
You beg reprieve for this expiring man,<br/>
I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence<br/>
From instant fate, and can so far dispense.<br/>
But, if some secret meaning lies beneath,<br/>
To save the short-liv'd youth from destin'd death,<br/>
Or if a farther thought you entertain,<br/>
To change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain."<br/>
To whom the goddess thus, with weeping eyes:<br/>
"And what if that request, your tongue denies,<br/>
Your heart should grant; and not a short reprieve,<br/>
But length of certain life, to Turnus give?<br/>
Now speedy death attends the guiltless youth,<br/>
If my presaging soul divines with truth;<br/>
Which, O! I wish, might err thro' causeless fears,<br/>
And you (for you have pow'r) prolong his years!"
</p>
<p>
Thus having said, involv'd in clouds, she flies,<br/>
And drives a storm before her thro' the skies.<br/>
Swift she descends, alighting on the plain,<br/>
Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain.<br/>
Of air condens'd a spectre soon she made;<br/>
And, what Aeneas was, such seem'd the shade.<br/>
Adorn'd with Dardan arms, the phantom bore<br/>
His head aloft; a plumy crest he wore;<br/>
This hand appear'd a shining sword to wield,<br/>
And that sustain'd an imitated shield.<br/>
With manly mien he stalk'd along the ground,<br/>
Nor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound.<br/>
(Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight,<br/>
Or dreadful visions in our dreams by night.)<br/>
The spectre seems the Daunian chief to dare,<br/>
And flourishes his empty sword in air.<br/>
At this, advancing, Turnus hurl'd his spear:<br/>
The phantom wheel'd, and seem'd to fly for fear.<br/>
Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled,<br/>
And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed.<br/>
"Whether, O coward?" (thus he calls aloud,<br/>
Nor found he spoke to wind, and chas'd a cloud,)<br/>
"Why thus forsake your bride! Receive from me<br/>
The fated land you sought so long by sea."<br/>
He said, and, brandishing at once his blade,<br/>
With eager pace pursued the flying shade.<br/>
By chance a ship was fasten'd to the shore,<br/>
Which from old Clusium King Osinius bore:<br/>
The plank was ready laid for safe ascent;<br/>
For shelter there the trembling shadow bent,<br/>
And skipp't and skulk'd, and under hatches went.<br/>
Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste,<br/>
Ascends the plank, and to the galley pass'd.<br/>
Scarce had he reach'd the prow: Saturnia's hand<br/>
The haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land.<br/>
With wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea,<br/>
And measures back with speed her former way.<br/>
Meantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe,<br/>
And sends his slaughter'd troops to shades below.
</p>
<p>
The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud,<br/>
And flew sublime, and vanish'd in a cloud.<br/>
Too late young Turnus the delusion found,<br/>
Far on the sea, still making from the ground.<br/>
Then, thankless for a life redeem'd by shame,<br/>
With sense of honour stung, and forfeit fame,<br/>
Fearful besides of what in fight had pass'd,<br/>
His hands and haggard eyes to heav'n he cast;<br/>
"O Jove!" he cried, "for what offence have I<br/>
Deserv'd to bear this endless infamy?<br/>
Whence am I forc'd, and whether am I borne?<br/>
How, and with what reproach, shall I return?<br/>
Shall ever I behold the Latian plain,<br/>
Or see Laurentum's lofty tow'rs again?<br/>
What will they say of their deserting chief<br/>
The war was mine: I fly from their relief;<br/>
I led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave;<br/>
And ev'n from hence their dying groans receive.<br/>
Here, overmatch'd in fight, in heaps they lie;<br/>
There, scatter'd o'er the fields, ignobly fly.<br/>
Gape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive!<br/>
Or, O ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve!<br/>
On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive;<br/>
Or set me shipwreck'd on some desert shore,<br/>
Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more,<br/>
Unknown to friends, or foes, or conscious Fame,<br/>
Lest she should follow, and my flight proclaim."
</p>
<p>
Thus Turnus rav'd, and various fates revolv'd:<br/>
The choice was doubtful, but the death resolv'd.<br/>
And now the sword, and now the sea took place,<br/>
That to revenge, and this to purge disgrace.<br/>
Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main,<br/>
By stretch of arms the distant shore to gain.<br/>
Thrice he the sword assay'd, and thrice the flood;<br/>
But Juno, mov'd with pity, both withstood.<br/>
And thrice repress'd his rage; strong gales supplied,<br/>
And push'd the vessel o'er the swelling tide.<br/>
At length she lands him on his native shores,<br/>
And to his father's longing arms restores.
</p>
<p>
Meantime, by Jove's impulse, Mezentius arm'd,<br/>
Succeeding Turnus, with his ardour warm'd<br/>
His fainting friends, reproach'd their shameful flight,<br/>
Repell'd the victors, and renew'd the fight.<br/>
Against their king the Tuscan troops conspire;<br/>
Such is their hate, and such their fierce desire<br/>
Of wish'd revenge: on him, and him alone,<br/>
All hands employ'd, and all their darts are thrown.<br/>
He, like a solid rock by seas inclos'd,<br/>
To raging winds and roaring waves oppos'd,<br/>
From his proud summit looking down, disdains<br/>
Their empty menace, and unmov'd remains.
</p>
<p>
Beneath his feet fell haughty Hebrus dead,<br/>
Then Latagus, and Palmus as he fled.<br/>
At Latagus a weighty stone he flung:<br/>
His face was flatted, and his helmet rung.<br/>
But Palmus from behind receives his wound;<br/>
Hamstring'd he falls, and grovels on the ground:<br/>
His crest and armour, from his body torn,<br/>
Thy shoulders, Lausus, and thy head adorn.<br/>
Evas and Mimas, both of Troy, he slew.<br/>
Mimas his birth from fair Theano drew,<br/>
Born on that fatal night, when, big with fire,<br/>
The queen produc'd young Paris to his sire:<br/>
But Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain,<br/>
Unthinking Mimas on the Latian plain.
</p>
<p>
And, as a savage boar, on mountains bred,<br/>
With forest mast and fatt'ning marshes fed,<br/>
When once he sees himself in toils inclos'd,<br/>
By huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos'd,<br/>
He whets his tusks, and turns, and dares the war;<br/>
Th' invaders dart their jav'lins from afar:<br/>
All keep aloof, and safely shout around;<br/>
But none presumes to give a nearer wound:<br/>
He frets and froths, erects his bristled hide,<br/>
And shakes a grove of lances from his side:<br/>
Not otherwise the troops, with hate inspir'd,<br/>
And just revenge against the tyrant fir'd,<br/>
Their darts with clamour at a distance drive,<br/>
And only keep the languish'd war alive.
</p>
<p>
From Coritus came Acron to the fight,<br/>
Who left his spouse betroth'd, and unconsummate night.<br/>
Mezentius sees him thro' the squadrons ride,<br/>
Proud of the purple favours of his bride.<br/>
Then, as a hungry lion, who beholds<br/>
A gamesome goat, who frisks about the folds,<br/>
Or beamy stag, that grazes on the plain—<br/>
He runs, he roars, he shakes his rising mane,<br/>
He grins, and opens wide his greedy jaws;<br/>
The prey lies panting underneath his paws:<br/>
He fills his famish'd maw; his mouth runs o'er<br/>
With unchew'd morsels, while he churns the gore:<br/>
So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes,<br/>
And first unhappy Acron overthrows:<br/>
Stretch'd at his length, he spurns the swarthy ground;<br/>
The lance, besmear'd with blood, lies broken in the wound.<br/>
Then with disdain the haughty victor view'd<br/>
Orodes flying, nor the wretch pursued,<br/>
Nor thought the dastard's back deserv'd a wound,<br/>
But, running, gain'd th' advantage of the ground:<br/>
Then turning short, he met him face to face,<br/>
To give his victory the better grace.<br/>
Orodes falls, in equal fight oppress'd:<br/>
Mezentius fix'd his foot upon his breast,<br/>
And rested lance; and thus aloud he cries:<br/>
"Lo! here the champion of my rebels lies!"<br/>
The fields around with Io Paean! ring;<br/>
And peals of shouts applaud the conqu'ring king.<br/>
At this the vanquish'd, with his dying breath,<br/>
Thus faintly spoke, and prophesied in death:<br/>
"Nor thou, proud man, unpunish'd shalt remain:<br/>
Like death attends thee on this fatal plain."<br/>
Then, sourly smiling, thus the king replied:<br/>
"For what belongs to me, let Jove provide;<br/>
But die thou first, whatever chance ensue."<br/>
He said, and from the wound the weapon drew.<br/>
A hov'ring mist came swimming o'er his sight,<br/>
And seal'd his eyes in everlasting night.
</p>
<p>
By Caedicus, Alcathous was slain;<br/>
Sacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain;<br/>
Orses the strong to greater strength must yield;<br/>
He, with Parthenius, were by Rapo kill'd.<br/>
Then brave Messapus Ericetes slew,<br/>
Who from Lycaon's blood his lineage drew.<br/>
But from his headstrong horse his fate he found,<br/>
Who threw his master, as he made a bound:<br/>
The chief, alighting, stuck him to the ground;<br/>
Then Clonius, hand to hand, on foot assails:<br/>
The Trojan sinks, and Neptune's son prevails.<br/>
Agis the Lycian, stepping forth with pride,<br/>
To single fight the boldest foe defied;<br/>
Whom Tuscan Valerus by force o'ercame,<br/>
And not belied his mighty father's fame.<br/>
Salius to death the great Antronius sent:<br/>
But the same fate the victor underwent,<br/>
Slain by Nealces' hand, well-skill'd to throw<br/>
The flying dart, and draw the far-deceiving bow.
</p>
<p>
Thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance;<br/>
By turns they quit their ground, by turns advance:<br/>
Victors and vanquish'd, in the various field,<br/>
Nor wholly overcome, nor wholly yield.<br/>
The gods from heav'n survey the fatal strife,<br/>
And mourn the miseries of human life.<br/>
Above the rest, two goddesses appear<br/>
Concern'd for each: here Venus, Juno there.<br/>
Amidst the crowd, infernal Ate shakes<br/>
Her scourge aloft, and crest of hissing snakes.
</p>
<p>
Once more the proud Mezentius, with disdain,<br/>
Brandish'd his spear, and rush'd into the plain,<br/>
Where tow'ring in the midmost rank he stood,<br/>
Like tall Orion stalking o'er the flood.<br/>
(When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves,<br/>
His shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves),<br/>
Or like a mountain ash, whose roots are spread,<br/>
Deep fix'd in earth; in clouds he hides his head.
</p>
<p>
The Trojan prince beheld him from afar,<br/>
And dauntless undertook the doubtful war.<br/>
Collected in his strength, and like a rock,<br/>
Pois'd on his base, Mezentius stood the shock.<br/>
He stood, and, measuring first with careful eyes<br/>
The space his spear could reach, aloud he cries:<br/>
"My strong right hand, and sword, assist my stroke!<br/>
(Those only gods Mezentius will invoke.)<br/>
His armour, from the Trojan pirate torn,<br/>
By my triumphant Lausus shall be worn."<br/>
He said; and with his utmost force he threw<br/>
The massy spear, which, hissing as it flew,<br/>
Reach'd the celestial shield, that stopp'd the course;<br/>
But, glancing thence, the yet unbroken force<br/>
Took a new bent obliquely, and betwixt<br/>
The side and bowels fam'd Anthores fix'd.<br/>
Anthores had from Argos travel'd far,<br/>
Alcides' friend, and brother of the war;<br/>
Till, tir'd with toils, fair Italy he chose,<br/>
And in Evander's palace sought repose.<br/>
Now, falling by another's wound, his eyes<br/>
He cast to heav'n, on Argos thinks, and dies.
</p>
<p>
The pious Trojan then his jav'lin sent;<br/>
The shield gave way; thro' treble plates it went<br/>
Of solid brass, of linen trebly roll'd,<br/>
And three bull hides which round the buckler fold.<br/>
All these it pass'd, resistless in the course,<br/>
Transpierc'd his thigh, and spent its dying force.<br/>
The gaping wound gush'd out a crimson flood.<br/>
The Trojan, glad with sight of hostile blood,<br/>
His falchion drew, to closer fight address'd,<br/>
And with new force his fainting foe oppress'd.
</p>
<p>
His father's peril Lausus view'd with grief;<br/>
He sigh'd, he wept, he ran to his relief.<br/>
And here, heroic youth, 'tis here I must<br/>
To thy immortal memory be just,<br/>
And sing an act so noble and so new,<br/>
Posterity will scarce believe 'tis true.<br/>
Pain'd with his wound, and useless for the fight,<br/>
The father sought to save himself by flight:<br/>
Encumber'd, slow he dragg'd the spear along,<br/>
Which pierc'd his thigh, and in his buckler hung.<br/>
The pious youth, resolv'd on death, below<br/>
The lifted sword springs forth to face the foe;<br/>
Protects his parent, and prevents the blow.<br/>
Shouts of applause ran ringing thro' the field,<br/>
To see the son the vanquish'd father shield.<br/>
All, fir'd with gen'rous indignation, strive,<br/>
And with a storm of darts to distance drive<br/>
The Trojan chief, who, held at bay from far,<br/>
On his Vulcanian orb sustain'd the war.
</p>
<p>
As, when thick hail comes rattling in the wind,<br/>
The plowman, passenger, and lab'ring hind<br/>
For shelter to the neighb'ring covert fly,<br/>
Or hous'd, or safe in hollow caverns lie;<br/>
But, that o'erblown, when heav'n above 'em smiles,<br/>
Return to travel, and renew their toils:<br/>
Aeneas thus, o'erwhelmed on ev'ry side,<br/>
The storm of darts, undaunted, did abide;<br/>
And thus to Lausus loud with friendly threat'ning cried:<br/>
"Why wilt thou rush to certain death, and rage<br/>
In rash attempts, beyond thy tender age,<br/>
Betray'd by pious love?" Nor, thus forborne,<br/>
The youth desists, but with insulting scorn<br/>
Provokes the ling'ring prince, whose patience, tir'd,<br/>
Gave place; and all his breast with fury fir'd.<br/>
For now the Fates prepar'd their sharpen'd shears;<br/>
And lifted high the flaming sword appears,<br/>
Which, full descending with a frightful sway,<br/>
Thro' shield and corslet forc'd th' impetuous way,<br/>
And buried deep in his fair bosom lay.<br/>
The purple streams thro' the thin armour strove,<br/>
And drench'd th' imbroider'd coat his mother wove;<br/>
And life at length forsook his heaving heart,<br/>
Loth from so sweet a mansion to depart.
</p>
<p>
But when, with blood and paleness all o'erspread,<br/>
The pious prince beheld young Lausus dead,<br/>
He griev'd; he wept; the sight an image brought<br/>
Of his own filial love, a sadly pleasing thought:<br/>
Then stretch'd his hand to hold him up, and said:<br/>
"Poor hapless youth! what praises can be paid<br/>
To love so great, to such transcendent store<br/>
Of early worth, and sure presage of more?<br/>
Accept whate'er Aeneas can afford;<br/>
Untouch'd thy arms, untaken be thy sword;<br/>
And all that pleas'd thee living, still remain<br/>
Inviolate, and sacred to the slain.<br/>
Thy body on thy parents I bestow,<br/>
To rest thy soul, at least, if shadows know,<br/>
Or have a sense of human things below.<br/>
There to thy fellow ghosts with glory tell:<br/>
''Twas by the great Aeneas hand I fell.'"<br/>
With this, his distant friends he beckons near,<br/>
Provokes their duty, and prevents their fear:<br/>
Himself assists to lift him from the ground,<br/>
With clotted locks, and blood that well'd from out the wound.
</p>
<p>
Meantime, his father, now no father, stood,<br/>
And wash'd his wounds by Tiber's yellow flood:<br/>
Oppress'd with anguish, panting, and o'erspent,<br/>
His fainting limbs against an oak he leant.<br/>
A bough his brazen helmet did sustain;<br/>
His heavier arms lay scatter'd on the plain:<br/>
A chosen train of youth around him stand;<br/>
His drooping head was rested on his hand:<br/>
His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought;<br/>
And all on Lausus ran his restless thought.<br/>
Careful, concern'd his danger to prevent,<br/>
He much enquir'd, and many a message sent<br/>
To warn him from the field—alas! in vain!<br/>
Behold, his mournful followers bear him slain!<br/>
O'er his broad shield still gush'd the yawning wound,<br/>
And drew a bloody trail along the ground.<br/>
Far off he heard their cries, far off divin'd<br/>
The dire event, with a foreboding mind.<br/>
With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head;<br/>
Then both his lifted hands to heav'n he spread;<br/>
Last, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said:<br/>
"What joys, alas! could this frail being give,<br/>
That I have been so covetous to live?<br/>
To see my son, and such a son, resign<br/>
His life, a ransom for preserving mine!<br/>
And am I then preserv'd, and art thou lost?<br/>
How much too dear has that redemption cost!<br/>
'Tis now my bitter banishment I feel:<br/>
This is a wound too deep for time to heal.<br/>
My guilt thy growing virtues did defame;<br/>
My blackness blotted thy unblemish'd name.<br/>
Chas'd from a throne, abandon'd, and exil'd<br/>
For foul misdeeds, were punishments too mild:<br/>
I ow'd my people these, and, from their hate,<br/>
With less resentment could have borne my fate.<br/>
And yet I live, and yet sustain the sight<br/>
Of hated men, and of more hated light:<br/>
But will not long." With that he rais'd from ground<br/>
His fainting limbs, that stagger'd with his wound;<br/>
Yet, with a mind resolv'd, and unappall'd<br/>
With pains or perils, for his courser call'd<br/>
Well-mouth'd, well-manag'd, whom himself did dress<br/>
With daily care, and mounted with success;<br/>
His aid in arms, his ornament in peace.
</p>
<p>
Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke,<br/>
The steed seem'd sensible, while thus he spoke:<br/>
"O Rhoebus, we have liv'd too long for me—<br/>
If life and long were terms that could agree!<br/>
This day thou either shalt bring back the head<br/>
And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead;<br/>
This day thou either shalt revenge my woe,<br/>
For murder'd Lausus, on his cruel foe;<br/>
Or, if inexorable fate deny<br/>
Our conquest, with thy conquer'd master die:<br/>
For, after such a lord, I rest secure,<br/>
Thou wilt no foreign reins, or Trojan load endure."<br/>
He said; and straight th' officious courser kneels,<br/>
To take his wonted weight. His hands he fills<br/>
With pointed jav'lins; on his head he lac'd<br/>
His glitt'ring helm, which terribly was grac'd<br/>
With waving horsehair, nodding from afar;<br/>
Then spurr'd his thund'ring steed amidst the war.<br/>
Love, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought,<br/>
Despair, and secret shame, and conscious thought<br/>
Of inborn worth, his lab'ring soul oppress'd,<br/>
Roll'd in his eyes, and rag'd within his breast.<br/>
Then loud he call'd Aeneas thrice by name:<br/>
The loud repeated voice to glad Aeneas came.<br/>
"Great Jove," he said, "and the far-shooting god,<br/>
Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good!"<br/>
He spoke no more; but hasten'd, void of fear,<br/>
And threaten'd with his long protended spear.
</p>
<p>
To whom Mezentius thus: "Thy vaunts are vain.<br/>
My Lausus lies extended on the plain:<br/>
He's lost! thy conquest is already won;<br/>
The wretched sire is murder'd in the son.<br/>
Nor fate I fear, but all the gods defy.<br/>
Forbear thy threats: my bus'ness is to die;<br/>
But first receive this parting legacy."<br/>
He said; and straight a whirling dart he sent;<br/>
Another after, and another went.<br/>
Round in a spacious ring he rides the field,<br/>
And vainly plies th' impenetrable shield.<br/>
Thrice rode he round; and thrice Aeneas wheel'd,<br/>
Turn'd as he turn'd: the golden orb withstood<br/>
The strokes, and bore about an iron wood.<br/>
Impatient of delay, and weary grown,<br/>
Still to defend, and to defend alone,<br/>
To wrench the darts which in his buckler light,<br/>
Urg'd and o'er-labour'd in unequal fight;<br/>
At length resolv'd, he throws with all his force<br/>
Full at the temples of the warrior horse.<br/>
Just where the stroke was aim'd, th' unerring spear<br/>
Made way, and stood transfix'd thro' either ear.<br/>
Seiz'd with unwonted pain, surpris'd with fright,<br/>
The wounded steed curvets, and, rais'd upright,<br/>
Lights on his feet before; his hoofs behind<br/>
Spring up in air aloft, and lash the wind.<br/>
Down comes the rider headlong from his height:<br/>
His horse came after with unwieldy weight,<br/>
And, flound'ring forward, pitching on his head,<br/>
His lord's encumber'd shoulder overlaid.
</p>
<p>
From either host, the mingled shouts and cries<br/>
Of Trojans and Rutulians rend the skies.<br/>
Aeneas, hast'ning, wav'd his fatal sword<br/>
High o'er his head, with this reproachful word:<br/>
"Now; where are now thy vaunts, the fierce disdain<br/>
Of proud Mezentius, and the lofty strain?"
</p>
<p>
Struggling, and wildly staring on the skies,<br/>
With scarce recover'd sight he thus replies:<br/>
"Why these insulting words, this waste of breath,<br/>
To souls undaunted, and secure of death?<br/>
'Tis no dishonour for the brave to die,<br/>
Nor came I here with hope of victory;<br/>
Nor ask I life, nor fought with that design:<br/>
As I had us'd my fortune, use thou thine.<br/>
My dying son contracted no such band;<br/>
The gift is hateful from his murd'rer's hand.<br/>
For this, this only favour let me sue,<br/>
If pity can to conquer'd foes be due:<br/>
Refuse it not; but let my body have<br/>
The last retreat of humankind, a grave.<br/>
Too well I know th' insulting people's hate;<br/>
Protect me from their vengeance after fate:<br/>
This refuge for my poor remains provide,<br/>
And lay my much-lov'd Lausus by my side."<br/>
He said, and to the sword his throat applied.<br/>
The crimson stream distain'd his arms around,<br/>
And the disdainful soul came rushing thro' the wound.

<h1>Aeneid</h1>
<h2>by Virgil</h2>
<h3>Book III</h3>
<p>
"When Heav'n had overturn'd the Trojan state<br/>
And Priam's throne, by too severe a fate;<br/>
When ruin'd Troy became the Grecians' prey,<br/>
And Ilium's lofty tow'rs in ashes lay;<br/>
Warn'd by celestial omens, we retreat,<br/>
To seek in foreign lands a happier seat.<br/>
Near old Antandros, and at Ida's foot,<br/>
The timber of the sacred groves we cut,<br/>
And build our fleet; uncertain yet to find<br/>
What place the gods for our repose assign'd.<br/>
Friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring<br/>
Began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing,<br/>
When old Anchises summon'd all to sea:<br/>
The crew my father and the Fates obey.<br/>
With sighs and tears I leave my native shore,<br/>
And empty fields, where Ilium stood before.<br/>
My sire, my son, our less and greater gods,<br/>
All sail at once, and cleave the briny floods.
</p>
<p>
"Against our coast appears a spacious land,<br/>
Which once the fierce Lycurgus did command,<br/>
Thracia the name; the people bold in war;<br/>
Vast are their fields, and tillage is their care,<br/>
A hospitable realm while Fate was kind,<br/>
With Troy in friendship and religion join'd.<br/>
I land; with luckless omens, then adore<br/>
Their gods, and draw a line along the shore;<br/>
I lay the deep foundations of a wall,<br/>
And Aenos, nam'd from me, the city call.<br/>
To Dionaean Venus vows are paid,<br/>
And all the pow'rs that rising labours aid;<br/>
A bull on Jove's imperial altar laid.<br/>
Not far, a rising hillock stood in view;<br/>
Sharp myrtles on the sides, and cornels grew.<br/>
There, while I went to crop the sylvan scenes,<br/>
And shade our altar with their leafy greens,<br/>
I pull'd a plant; with horror I relate<br/>
A prodigy so strange and full of fate.<br/>
The rooted fibers rose, and from the wound<br/>
Black bloody drops distill'd upon the ground.<br/>
Mute and amaz'd, my hair with terror stood;<br/>
Fear shrunk my sinews, and congeal'd my blood.<br/>
Mann'd once again, another plant I try:<br/>
That other gush'd with the same sanguine dye.<br/>
Then, fearing guilt for some offence unknown,<br/>
With pray'rs and vows the Dryads I atone,<br/>
With all the sisters of the woods, and most<br/>
The God of Arms, who rules the Thracian coast,<br/>
That they, or he, these omens would avert,<br/>
Release our fears, and better signs impart.<br/>
Clear'd, as I thought, and fully fix'd at length<br/>
To learn the cause, I tugged with all my strength:<br/>
I bent my knees against the ground; once more<br/>
The violated myrtle ran with gore.<br/>
Scarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb<br/>
Of wounded earth, and caverns of the tomb,<br/>
A groan, as of a troubled ghost, renew'd<br/>
My fright, and then these dreadful words ensued:<br/>
'Why dost thou thus my buried body rend?<br/>
O spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend!<br/>
Spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood:<br/>
The tears distil not from the wounded wood;<br/>
But ev'ry drop this living tree contains<br/>
Is kindred blood, and ran in Trojan veins.<br/>
O fly from this unhospitable shore,<br/>
Warn'd by my fate; for I am Polydore!<br/>
Here loads of lances, in my blood embrued,<br/>
Again shoot upward, by my blood renew'd.'
</p>
<p>
"My falt'ring tongue and shiv'ring limbs declare<br/>
My horror, and in bristles rose my hair.<br/>
When Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent,<br/>
Old Priam, fearful of the war's event,<br/>
This hapless Polydore to Thracia sent:<br/>
Loaded with gold, he sent his darling, far<br/>
From noise and tumults, and destructive war,<br/>
Committed to the faithless tyrant's care;<br/>
Who, when he saw the pow'r of Troy decline,<br/>
Forsook the weaker, with the strong to join;<br/>
Broke ev'ry bond of nature and of truth,<br/>
And murder'd, for his wealth, the royal youth.<br/>
O sacred hunger of pernicious gold!<br/>
What bands of faith can impious lucre hold?<br/>
Now, when my soul had shaken off her fears,<br/>
I call my father and the Trojan peers;<br/>
Relate the prodigies of Heav'n, require<br/>
What he commands, and their advice desire.<br/>
All vote to leave that execrable shore,<br/>
Polluted with the blood of Polydore;<br/>
But, ere we sail, his fun'ral rites prepare,<br/>
Then, to his ghost, a tomb and altars rear.<br/>
In mournful pomp the matrons walk the round,<br/>
With baleful cypress and blue fillets crown'd,<br/>
With eyes dejected, and with hair unbound.<br/>
Then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour,<br/>
And thrice invoke the soul of Polydore.
</p>
<p>
"Now, when the raging storms no longer reign,<br/>
But southern gales invite us to the main,<br/>
We launch our vessels, with a prosp'rous wind,<br/>
And leave the cities and the shores behind.
</p>
<p>
"An island in th' Aegaean main appears;<br/>
Neptune and wat'ry Doris claim it theirs.<br/>
It floated once, till Phoebus fix'd the sides<br/>
To rooted earth, and now it braves the tides.<br/>
Here, borne by friendly winds, we come ashore,<br/>
With needful ease our weary limbs restore,<br/>
And the Sun's temple and his town adore.
</p>
<p>
"Anius, the priest and king, with laurel crown'd,<br/>
His hoary locks with purple fillets bound,<br/>
Who saw my sire the Delian shore ascend,<br/>
Came forth with eager haste to meet his friend;<br/>
Invites him to his palace; and, in sign<br/>
Of ancient love, their plighted hands they join.<br/>
Then to the temple of the god I went,<br/>
And thus, before the shrine, my vows present:<br/>
'Give, O Thymbraeus, give a resting place<br/>
To the sad relics of the Trojan race;<br/>
A seat secure, a region of their own,<br/>
A lasting empire, and a happier town.<br/>
Where shall we fix? where shall our labours end?<br/>
Whom shall we follow, and what fate attend?<br/>
Let not my pray'rs a doubtful answer find;<br/>
But in clear auguries unveil thy mind.'<br/>
Scarce had I said: he shook the holy ground,<br/>
The laurels, and the lofty hills around;<br/>
And from the tripos rush'd a bellowing sound.<br/>
Prostrate we fell; confess'd the present god,<br/>
Who gave this answer from his dark abode:<br/>
'Undaunted youths, go, seek that mother earth<br/>
From which your ancestors derive their birth.<br/>
The soil that sent you forth, her ancient race<br/>
In her old bosom shall again embrace.<br/>
Through the wide world th' Aeneian house shall reign,<br/>
And children's children shall the crown sustain.'<br/>
Thus Phoebus did our future fates disclose:<br/>
A mighty tumult, mix'd with joy, arose.
</p>
<p>
"All are concern'd to know what place the god<br/>
Assign'd, and where determin'd our abode.<br/>
My father, long revolving in his mind<br/>
The race and lineage of the Trojan kind,<br/>
Thus answer'd their demands: 'Ye princes, hear<br/>
Your pleasing fortune, and dispel your fear.<br/>
The fruitful isle of Crete, well known to fame,<br/>
Sacred of old to Jove's imperial name,<br/>
In the mid ocean lies, with large command,<br/>
And on its plains a hundred cities stand.<br/>
Another Ida rises there, and we<br/>
From thence derive our Trojan ancestry.<br/>
From thence, as 'tis divulg'd by certain fame,<br/>
To the Rhoetean shores old Teucrus came;<br/>
There fix'd, and there the seat of empire chose,<br/>
Ere Ilium and the Trojan tow'rs arose.<br/>
In humble vales they built their soft abodes,<br/>
Till Cybele, the mother of the gods,<br/>
With tinkling cymbals charm'd th' Idaean woods,<br/>
She secret rites and ceremonies taught,<br/>
And to the yoke the savage lions brought.<br/>
Let us the land which Heav'n appoints, explore;<br/>
Appease the winds, and seek the Gnossian shore.<br/>
If Jove assists the passage of our fleet,<br/>
The third propitious dawn discovers Crete.'<br/>
Thus having said, the sacrifices, laid<br/>
On smoking altars, to the gods he paid:<br/>
A bull, to Neptune an oblation due,<br/>
Another bull to bright Apollo slew;<br/>
A milk-white ewe, the western winds to please,<br/>
And one coal-black, to calm the stormy seas.<br/>
Ere this, a flying rumour had been spread<br/>
That fierce Idomeneus from Crete was fled,<br/>
Expell'd and exil'd; that the coast was free<br/>
From foreign or domestic enemy.
</p>
<p>
"We leave the Delian ports, and put to sea.<br/>
By Naxos, fam'd for vintage, make our way;<br/>
Then green Donysa pass; and sail in sight<br/>
Of Paros' isle, with marble quarries white.<br/>
We pass the scatter'd isles of Cyclades,<br/>
That, scarce distinguish'd, seem to stud the seas.<br/>
The shouts of sailors double near the shores;<br/>
They stretch their canvas, and they ply their oars.<br/>
'All hands aloft! for Crete! for Crete!' they cry,<br/>
And swiftly thro' the foamy billows fly.<br/>
Full on the promis'd land at length we bore,<br/>
With joy descending on the Cretan shore.<br/>
With eager haste a rising town I frame,<br/>
Which from the Trojan Pergamus I name:<br/>
The name itself was grateful; I exhort<br/>
To found their houses, and erect a fort.<br/>
Our ships are haul'd upon the yellow strand;<br/>
The youth begin to till the labour'd land;<br/>
And I myself new marriages promote,<br/>
Give laws, and dwellings I divide by lot;<br/>
When rising vapours choke the wholesome air,<br/>
And blasts of noisome winds corrupt the year;<br/>
The trees devouring caterpillars burn;<br/>
Parch'd was the grass, and blighted was the corn:<br/>
Nor 'scape the beasts; for Sirius, from on high,<br/>
With pestilential heat infects the sky:<br/>
My men, some fall, the rest in fevers fry.<br/>
Again my father bids me seek the shore<br/>
Of sacred Delos, and the god implore,<br/>
To learn what end of woes we might expect,<br/>
And to what clime our weary course direct.
</p>
<p>
"'Twas night, when ev'ry creature, void of cares,<br/>
The common gift of balmy slumber shares:<br/>
The statues of my gods (for such they seem'd),<br/>
Those gods whom I from flaming Troy redeem'd,<br/>
Before me stood, majestically bright,<br/>
Full in the beams of Phoebe's ent'ring light.<br/>
Then thus they spoke, and eas'd my troubled mind:<br/>
'What from the Delian god thou go'st to find,<br/>
He tells thee here, and sends us to relate.<br/>
Those pow'rs are we, companions of thy fate,<br/>
Who from the burning town by thee were brought,<br/>
Thy fortune follow'd, and thy safety wrought.<br/>
Thro' seas and lands as we thy steps attend,<br/>
So shall our care thy glorious race befriend.<br/>
An ample realm for thee thy fates ordain,<br/>
A town that o'er the conquer'd world shall reign.<br/>
Thou, mighty walls for mighty nations build;<br/>
Nor let thy weary mind to labours yield:<br/>
But change thy seat; for not the Delian god,<br/>
Nor we, have giv'n thee Crete for our abode.<br/>
A land there is, Hesperia call'd of old,<br/>
The soil is fruitful, and the natives bold.<br/>
Th' Oenotrians held it once, by later fame<br/>
Now call'd Italia, from the leader's name.<br/>
Jasius there and Dardanus were born;<br/>
From thence we came, and thither must return.<br/>
Rise, and thy sire with these glad tidings greet.<br/>
Search Italy; for Jove denies thee Crete.'
</p>
<p>
"Astonish'd at their voices and their sight,<br/>
(Nor were they dreams, but visions of the night;<br/>
I saw, I knew their faces, and descried,<br/>
In perfect view, their hair with fillets tied;)<br/>
I started from my couch; a clammy sweat<br/>
On all my limbs and shiv'ring body sate.<br/>
To heav'n I lift my hands with pious haste,<br/>
And sacred incense in the flames I cast.<br/>
Thus to the gods their perfect honours done,<br/>
More cheerful, to my good old sire I run,<br/>
And tell the pleasing news. In little space<br/>
He found his error of the double race;<br/>
Not, as before he deem'd, deriv'd from Crete;<br/>
No more deluded by the doubtful seat:<br/>
Then said: 'O son, turmoil'd in Trojan fate!<br/>
Such things as these Cassandra did relate.<br/>
This day revives within my mind what she<br/>
Foretold of Troy renew'd in Italy,<br/>
And Latian lands; but who could then have thought<br/>
That Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought,<br/>
Or who believ'd what mad Cassandra taught?<br/>
Now let us go where Phoebus leads the way.'
</p>
<p>
"He said; and we with glad consent obey,<br/>
Forsake the seat, and, leaving few behind,<br/>
We spread our sails before the willing wind.<br/>
Now from the sight of land our galleys move,<br/>
With only seas around and skies above;<br/>
When o'er our heads descends a burst of rain,<br/>
And night with sable clouds involves the main;<br/>
The ruffling winds the foamy billows raise;<br/>
The scatter'd fleet is forc'd to sev'ral ways;<br/>
The face of heav'n is ravish'd from our eyes,<br/>
And in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies.<br/>
Cast from our course, we wander in the dark.<br/>
No stars to guide, no point of land to mark.<br/>
Ev'n Palinurus no distinction found<br/>
Betwixt the night and day; such darkness reign'd around.<br/>
Three starless nights the doubtful navy strays,<br/>
Without distinction, and three sunless days;<br/>
The fourth renews the light, and, from our shrouds,<br/>
We view a rising land, like distant clouds;<br/>
The mountain-tops confirm the pleasing sight,<br/>
And curling smoke ascending from their height.<br/>
The canvas falls; their oars the sailors ply;<br/>
From the rude strokes the whirling waters fly.<br/>
At length I land upon the Strophades,<br/>
Safe from the danger of the stormy seas.<br/>
Those isles are compass'd by th' Ionian main,<br/>
The dire abode where the foul Harpies reign,<br/>
Forc'd by the winged warriors to repair<br/>
To their old homes, and leave their costly fare.<br/>
Monsters more fierce offended Heav'n ne'er sent<br/>
From hell's abyss, for human punishment:<br/>
With virgin faces, but with wombs obscene,<br/>
Foul paunches, and with ordure still unclean;<br/>
With claws for hands, and looks for ever lean.
</p>
<p>
"We landed at the port, and soon beheld<br/>
Fat herds of oxen graze the flow'ry field,<br/>
And wanton goats without a keeper stray'd.<br/>
With weapons we the welcome prey invade,<br/>
Then call the gods for partners of our feast,<br/>
And Jove himself, the chief invited guest.<br/>
We spread the tables on the greensward ground;<br/>
We feed with hunger, and the bowls go round;<br/>
When from the mountain-tops, with hideous cry,<br/>
And clatt'ring wings, the hungry Harpies fly;<br/>
They snatch the meat, defiling all they find,<br/>
And, parting, leave a loathsome stench behind.<br/>
Close by a hollow rock, again we sit,<br/>
New dress the dinner, and the beds refit,<br/>
Secure from sight, beneath a pleasing shade,<br/>
Where tufted trees a native arbour made.<br/>
Again the holy fires on altars burn;<br/>
And once again the rav'nous birds return,<br/>
Or from the dark recesses where they lie,<br/>
Or from another quarter of the sky;<br/>
With filthy claws their odious meal repeat,<br/>
And mix their loathsome ordures with their meat.<br/>
I bid my friends for vengeance then prepare,<br/>
And with the hellish nation wage the war.<br/>
They, as commanded, for the fight provide,<br/>
And in the grass their glitt'ring weapons hide;<br/>
Then, when along the crooked shore we hear<br/>
Their clatt'ring wings, and saw the foes appear,<br/>
Misenus sounds a charge: we take th' alarm,<br/>
And our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm.<br/>
In this new kind of combat all employ<br/>
Their utmost force, the monsters to destroy.<br/>
In vain, the fated skin is proof to wounds;<br/>
And from their plumes the shining sword rebounds.<br/>
At length rebuff'd, they leave their mangled prey,<br/>
And their stretch'd pinions to the skies display.<br/>
Yet one remain'd, the messenger of Fate:<br/>
High on a craggy cliff Celaeno sate,<br/>
And thus her dismal errand did relate:<br/>
'What! not contented with our oxen slain,<br/>
Dare you with Heav'n an impious war maintain,<br/>
And drive the Harpies from their native reign?<br/>
Heed therefore what I say; and keep in mind<br/>
What Jove decrees, what Phoebus has design'd,<br/>
And I, the Furies' queen, from both relate:<br/>
You seek th' Italian shores, foredoom'd by fate:<br/>
Th' Italian shores are granted you to find,<br/>
And a safe passage to the port assign'd.<br/>
But know, that ere your promis'd walls you build,<br/>
My curses shall severely be fulfill'd.<br/>
Fierce famine is your lot for this misdeed,<br/>
Reduc'd to grind the plates on which you feed.'<br/>
She said, and to the neighb'ring forest flew.<br/>
Our courage fails us, and our fears renew.<br/>
Hopeless to win by war, to pray'rs we fall,<br/>
And on th' offended Harpies humbly call,<br/>
And whether gods or birds obscene they were,<br/>
Our vows for pardon and for peace prefer.<br/>
But old Anchises, off'ring sacrifice,<br/>
And lifting up to heav'n his hands and eyes,<br/>
Ador'd the greater gods: 'Avert,' said he,<br/>
'These omens; render vain this prophecy,<br/>
And from th' impending curse a pious people free!'
</p>
<p>
"Thus having said, he bids us put to sea;<br/>
We loose from shore our haulsers, and obey,<br/>
And soon with swelling sails pursue the wat'ry way.<br/>
Amidst our course, Zacynthian woods appear;<br/>
And next by rocky Neritos we steer:<br/>
We fly from Ithaca's detested shore,<br/>
And curse the land which dire Ulysses bore.<br/>
At length Leucate's cloudy top appears,<br/>
And the Sun's temple, which the sailor fears.<br/>
Resolv'd to breathe a while from labour past,<br/>
Our crooked anchors from the prow we cast,<br/>
And joyful to the little city haste.<br/>
Here, safe beyond our hopes, our vows we pay<br/>
To Jove, the guide and patron of our way.<br/>
The customs of our country we pursue,<br/>
And Trojan games on Actian shores renew.<br/>
Our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil,<br/>
And exercise the wrastlers' noble toil;<br/>
Pleas'd to have sail'd so long before the wind,<br/>
And left so many Grecian towns behind.<br/>
The sun had now fulfill'd his annual course,<br/>
And Boreas on the seas display'd his force:<br/>
I fix'd upon the temple's lofty door<br/>
The brazen shield which vanquish'd Abas bore;<br/>
The verse beneath my name and action speaks:<br/>
'These arms Aeneas took from conqu'ring Greeks.'<br/>
Then I command to weigh; the seamen ply<br/>
Their sweeping oars; the smoking billows fly.<br/>
The sight of high Phaeacia soon we lost,<br/>
And skimm'd along Epirus' rocky coast.
</p>
<p>
"Then to Chaonia's port our course we bend,<br/>
And, landed, to Buthrotus' heights ascend.<br/>
Here wondrous things were loudly blaz'd fame:<br/>
How Helenus reviv'd the Trojan name,<br/>
And reign'd in Greece; that Priam's captive son<br/>
Succeeded Pyrrhus in his bed and throne;<br/>
And fair Andromache, restor'd by fate,<br/>
Once more was happy in a Trojan mate.<br/>
I leave my galleys riding in the port,<br/>
And long to see the new Dardanian court.<br/>
By chance, the mournful queen, before the gate,<br/>
Then solemniz'd her former husband's fate.<br/>
Green altars, rais'd of turf, with gifts she crown'd,<br/>
And sacred priests in order stand around,<br/>
And thrice the name of hapless Hector sound.<br/>
The grove itself resembles Ida's wood;<br/>
And Simois seem'd the well-dissembled flood.<br/>
But when at nearer distance she beheld<br/>
My shining armour and my Trojan shield,<br/>
Astonish'd at the sight, the vital heat<br/>
Forsakes her limbs; her veins no longer beat:<br/>
She faints, she falls, and scarce recov'ring strength,<br/>
Thus, with a falt'ring tongue, she speaks at length:
</p>
<p>
"'Are you alive, O goddess-born?' she said,<br/>
'Or if a ghost, then where is Hector's shade?'<br/>
At this, she cast a loud and frightful cry.<br/>
With broken words I made this brief reply:<br/>
'All of me that remains appears in sight;<br/>
I live, if living be to loathe the light.<br/>
No phantom; but I drag a wretched life,<br/>
My fate resembling that of Hector's wife.<br/>
What have you suffer'd since you lost your lord?<br/>
By what strange blessing are you now restor'd?<br/>
Still are you Hector's? or is Hector fled,<br/>
And his remembrance lost in Pyrrhus' bed?'<br/>
With eyes dejected, in a lowly tone,<br/>
After a modest pause she thus begun:
</p>
<p>
"'O only happy maid of Priam's race,<br/>
Whom death deliver'd from the foes' embrace!<br/>
Commanded on Achilles' tomb to die,<br/>
Not forc'd, like us, to hard captivity,<br/>
Or in a haughty master's arms to lie.<br/>
In Grecian ships unhappy we were borne,<br/>
Endur'd the victor's lust, sustain'd the scorn:<br/>
Thus I submitted to the lawless pride<br/>
Of Pyrrhus, more a handmaid than a bride.<br/>
Cloy'd with possession, he forsook my bed,<br/>
And Helen's lovely daughter sought to wed;<br/>
Then me to Trojan Helenus resign'd,<br/>
And his two slaves in equal marriage join'd;<br/>
Till young Orestes, pierc'd with deep despair,<br/>
And longing to redeem the promis'd fair,<br/>
Before Apollo's altar slew the ravisher.<br/>
By Pyrrhus' death the kingdom we regain'd:<br/>
At least one half with Helenus remain'd.<br/>
Our part, from Chaon, he Chaonia calls,<br/>
And names from Pergamus his rising walls.<br/>
But you, what fates have landed on our coast?<br/>
What gods have sent you, or what storms have toss'd?<br/>
Does young Ascanius life and health enjoy,<br/>
Sav'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy?<br/>
O tell me how his mother's loss he bears,<br/>
What hopes are promis'd from his blooming years,<br/>
How much of Hector in his face appears?'<br/>
She spoke; and mix'd her speech with mournful cries,<br/>
And fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes.
</p>
<p>
"At length her lord descends upon the plain,<br/>
In pomp, attended with a num'rous train;<br/>
Receives his friends, and to the city leads,<br/>
And tears of joy amidst his welcome sheds.<br/>
Proceeding on, another Troy I see,<br/>
Or, in less compass, Troy's epitome.<br/>
A riv'let by the name of Xanthus ran,<br/>
And I embrace the Scaean gate again.<br/>
My friends in porticoes were entertain'd,<br/>
And feasts and pleasures thro' the city reign'd.<br/>
The tables fill'd the spacious hall around,<br/>
And golden bowls with sparkling wine were crown'd.<br/>
Two days we pass'd in mirth, till friendly gales,<br/>
Blown from the south supplied our swelling sails.<br/>
Then to the royal seer I thus began:<br/>
'O thou, who know'st, beyond the reach of man,<br/>
The laws of heav'n, and what the stars decree;<br/>
Whom Phoebus taught unerring prophecy,<br/>
From his own tripod, and his holy tree;<br/>
Skill'd in the wing'd inhabitants of air,<br/>
What auspices their notes and flights declare:<br/>
O say; for all religious rites portend<br/>
A happy voyage, and a prosp'rous end;<br/>
And ev'ry power and omen of the sky<br/>
Direct my course for destin'd Italy;<br/>
But only dire Celaeno, from the gods,<br/>
A dismal famine fatally forebodes:<br/>
O say what dangers I am first to shun,<br/>
What toils vanquish, and what course to run.'
</p>
<p>
"The prophet first with sacrifice adores<br/>
The greater gods; their pardon then implores;<br/>
Unbinds the fillet from his holy head;<br/>
To Phoebus, next, my trembling steps he led,<br/>
Full of religious doubts and awful dread.<br/>
Then, with his god possess'd, before the shrine,<br/>
These words proceeded from his mouth divine:<br/>
'O goddess-born, (for Heav'n's appointed will,<br/>
With greater auspices of good than ill,<br/>
Foreshows thy voyage, and thy course directs;<br/>
Thy fates conspire, and Jove himself protects,)<br/>
Of many things some few I shall explain,<br/>
Teach thee to shun the dangers of the main,<br/>
And how at length the promis'd shore to gain.<br/>
The rest the fates from Helenus conceal,<br/>
And Juno's angry pow'r forbids to tell.<br/>
First, then, that happy shore, that seems so nigh,<br/>
Will far from your deluded wishes fly;<br/>
Long tracts of seas divide your hopes from Italy:<br/>
For you must cruise along Sicilian shores,<br/>
And stem the currents with your struggling oars;<br/>
Then round th' Italian coast your navy steer;<br/>
And, after this, to Circe's island veer;<br/>
And, last, before your new foundations rise,<br/>
Must pass the Stygian lake, and view the nether skies.<br/>
Now mark the signs of future ease and rest,<br/>
And bear them safely treasur'd in thy breast.<br/>
When, in the shady shelter of a wood,<br/>
And near the margin of a gentle flood,<br/>
Thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground,<br/>
With thirty sucking young encompass'd round;<br/>
The dam and offspring white as falling snow:<br/>
These on thy city shall their name bestow,<br/>
And there shall end thy labours and thy woe.<br/>
Nor let the threaten'd famine fright thy mind,<br/>
For Phoebus will assist, and Fate the way will find.<br/>
Let not thy course to that ill coast be bent,<br/>
Which fronts from far th' Epirian continent:<br/>
Those parts are all by Grecian foes possess'd;<br/>
The salvage Locrians here the shores infest;<br/>
There fierce Idomeneus his city builds,<br/>
And guards with arms the Salentinian fields;<br/>
And on the mountain's brow Petilia stands,<br/>
Which Philoctetes with his troops commands.<br/>
Ev'n when thy fleet is landed on the shore,<br/>
And priests with holy vows the gods adore,<br/>
Then with a purple veil involve your eyes,<br/>
Lest hostile faces blast the sacrifice.<br/>
These rites and customs to the rest commend,<br/>
That to your pious race they may descend.
</p>
<p>
'When, parted hence, the wind, that ready waits<br/>
For Sicily, shall bear you to the straits<br/>
Where proud Pelorus opes a wider way,<br/>
Tack to the larboard, and stand off to sea:<br/>
Veer starboard sea and land. Th' Italian shore<br/>
And fair Sicilia's coast were one, before<br/>
An earthquake caus'd the flaw: the roaring tides<br/>
The passage broke that land from land divides;<br/>
And where the lands retir'd, the rushing ocean rides.<br/>
Distinguish'd by the straits, on either hand,<br/>
Now rising cities in long order stand,<br/>
And fruitful fields: so much can time invade<br/>
The mould'ring work that beauteous Nature made.<br/>
Far on the right, her dogs foul Scylla hides:<br/>
Charybdis roaring on the left presides,<br/>
And in her greedy whirlpool sucks the tides;<br/>
Then spouts them from below: with fury driv'n,<br/>
The waves mount up and wash the face of heav'n.<br/>
But Scylla from her den, with open jaws,<br/>
The sinking vessel in her eddy draws,<br/>
Then dashes on the rocks. A human face,<br/>
And virgin bosom, hides her tail's disgrace:<br/>
Her parts obscene below the waves descend,<br/>
With dogs inclos'd, and in a dolphin end.<br/>
'Tis safer, then, to bear aloof to sea,<br/>
And coast Pachynus, tho' with more delay,<br/>
Than once to view misshapen Scylla near,<br/>
And the loud yell of wat'ry wolves to hear.
</p>
<p>
"'Besides, if faith to Helenus be due,<br/>
And if prophetic Phoebus tell me true,<br/>
Do not this precept of your friend forget,<br/>
Which therefore more than once I must repeat:<br/>
Above the rest, great Juno's name adore;<br/>
Pay vows to Juno; Juno's aid implore.<br/>
Let gifts be to the mighty queen design'd,<br/>
And mollify with pray'rs her haughty mind.<br/>
Thus, at the length, your passage shall be free,<br/>
And you shall safe descend on Italy.<br/>
Arriv'd at Cumae, when you view the flood<br/>
Of black Avernus, and the sounding wood,<br/>
The mad prophetic Sibyl you shall find,<br/>
Dark in a cave, and on a rock reclin'd.<br/>
She sings the fates, and, in her frantic fits,<br/>
The notes and names, inscrib'd, to leafs commits.<br/>
What she commits to leafs, in order laid,<br/>
Before the cavern's entrance are display'd:<br/>
Unmov'd they lie; but, if a blast of wind<br/>
Without, or vapours issue from behind,<br/>
The leafs are borne aloft in liquid air,<br/>
And she resumes no more her museful care,<br/>
Nor gathers from the rocks her scatter'd verse,<br/>
Nor sets in order what the winds disperse.<br/>
Thus, many not succeeding, most upbraid<br/>
The madness of the visionary maid,<br/>
And with loud curses leave the mystic shade.
</p>
<p>
"'Think it not loss of time a while to stay,<br/>
Tho' thy companions chide thy long delay;<br/>
Tho' summon'd to the seas, tho' pleasing gales<br/>
Invite thy course, and stretch thy swelling sails:<br/>
But beg the sacred priestess to relate<br/>
With willing words, and not to write thy fate.<br/>
The fierce Italian people she will show,<br/>
And all thy wars, and all thy future woe,<br/>
And what thou may'st avoid, and what must undergo.<br/>
She shall direct thy course, instruct thy mind,<br/>
And teach thee how the happy shores to find.<br/>
This is what Heav'n allows me to relate:<br/>
Now part in peace; pursue thy better fate,<br/>
And raise, by strength of arms, the Trojan state.'
</p>
<p>
"This when the priest with friendly voice declar'd,<br/>
He gave me license, and rich gifts prepar'd:<br/>
Bounteous of treasure, he supplied my want<br/>
With heavy gold, and polish'd elephant;<br/>
Then Dodonaean caldrons put on board,<br/>
And ev'ry ship with sums of silver stor'd.<br/>
A trusty coat of mail to me he sent,<br/>
Thrice chain'd with gold, for use and ornament;<br/>
The helm of Pyrrhus added to the rest,<br/>
That flourish'd with a plume and waving crest.<br/>
Nor was my sire forgotten, nor my friends;<br/>
And large recruits he to my navy sends:<br/>
Men, horses, captains, arms, and warlike stores;<br/>
Supplies new pilots, and new sweeping oars.<br/>
Meantime, my sire commands to hoist our sails,<br/>
Lest we should lose the first auspicious gales.
</p>
<p>
"The prophet bless'd the parting crew, and last,<br/>
With words like these, his ancient friend embrac'd:<br/>
'Old happy man, the care of gods above,<br/>
Whom heav'nly Venus honour'd with her love,<br/>
And twice preserv'd thy life, when Troy was lost,<br/>
Behold from far the wish'd Ausonian coast:<br/>
There land; but take a larger compass round,<br/>
For that before is all forbidden ground.<br/>
The shore that Phoebus has design'd for you,<br/>
At farther distance lies, conceal'd from view.<br/>
Go happy hence, and seek your new abodes,<br/>
Blest in a son, and favour'd by the gods:<br/>
For I with useless words prolong your stay,<br/>
When southern gales have summon'd you away.'
</p>
<p>
"Nor less the queen our parting thence deplor'd,<br/>
Nor was less bounteous than her Trojan lord.<br/>
A noble present to my son she brought,<br/>
A robe with flow'rs on golden tissue wrought,<br/>
A phrygian vest; and loads with gifts beside<br/>
Of precious texture, and of Asian pride.<br/>
'Accept,' she said, 'these monuments of love,<br/>
Which in my youth with happier hands I wove:<br/>
Regard these trifles for the giver's sake;<br/>
'Tis the last present Hector's wife can make.<br/>
Thou call'st my lost Astyanax to mind;<br/>
In thee his features and his form I find:<br/>
His eyes so sparkled with a lively flame;<br/>
Such were his motions; such was all his frame;<br/>
And ah! had Heav'n so pleas'd, his years had been the same.'
</p>
<p>
"With tears I took my last adieu, and said:<br/>
'Your fortune, happy pair, already made,<br/>
Leaves you no farther wish. My diff'rent state,<br/>
Avoiding one, incurs another fate.<br/>
To you a quiet seat the gods allow:<br/>
You have no shores to search, no seas to plow,<br/>
Nor fields of flying Italy to chase:<br/>
(Deluding visions, and a vain embrace!)<br/>
You see another Simois, and enjoy<br/>
The labour of your hands, another Troy,<br/>
With better auspice than her ancient tow'rs,<br/>
And less obnoxious to the Grecian pow'rs.<br/>
If e'er the gods, whom I with vows adore,<br/>
Conduct my steps to Tiber's happy shore;<br/>
If ever I ascend the Latian throne,<br/>
And build a city I may call my own;<br/>
As both of us our birth from Troy derive,<br/>
So let our kindred lines in concord live,<br/>
And both in acts of equal friendship strive.<br/>
Our fortunes, good or bad, shall be the same:<br/>
The double Troy shall differ but in name;<br/>
That what we now begin may never end,<br/>
But long to late posterity descend.'
</p>
<p>
"Near the Ceraunian rocks our course we bore;<br/>
The shortest passage to th' Italian shore.<br/>
Now had the sun withdrawn his radiant light,<br/>
And hills were hid in dusky shades of night:<br/>
We land, and, on the bosom of the ground,<br/>
A safe retreat and a bare lodging found.<br/>
Close by the shore we lay; the sailors keep<br/>
Their watches, and the rest securely sleep.<br/>
The night, proceeding on with silent pace,<br/>
Stood in her noon, and view'd with equal face<br/>
Her steepy rise and her declining race.<br/>
Then wakeful Palinurus rose, to spy<br/>
The face of heav'n, and the nocturnal sky;<br/>
And listen'd ev'ry breath of air to try;<br/>
Observes the stars, and notes their sliding course,<br/>
The Pleiads, Hyads, and their wat'ry force;<br/>
And both the Bears is careful to behold,<br/>
And bright Orion, arm'd with burnish'd gold.<br/>
Then, when he saw no threat'ning tempest nigh,<br/>
But a sure promise of a settled sky,<br/>
He gave the sign to weigh; we break our sleep,<br/>
Forsake the pleasing shore, and plow the deep.
</p>
<p>
"And now the rising morn with rosy light<br/>
Adorns the skies, and puts the stars to flight;<br/>
When we from far, like bluish mists, descry<br/>
The hills, and then the plains, of Italy.<br/>
Achates first pronounc'd the joyful sound;<br/>
Then, 'Italy!' the cheerful crew rebound.<br/>
My sire Anchises crown'd a cup with wine,<br/>
And, off'ring, thus implor'd the pow'rs divine:<br/>
'Ye gods, presiding over lands and seas,<br/>
And you who raging winds and waves appease,<br/>
Breathe on our swelling sails a prosp'rous wind,<br/>
And smooth our passage to the port assign'd!'<br/>
The gentle gales their flagging force renew,<br/>
And now the happy harbour is in view.<br/>
Minerva's temple then salutes our sight,<br/>
Plac'd, as a landmark, on the mountain's height.<br/>
We furl our sails, and turn the prows to shore;<br/>
The curling waters round the galleys roar.<br/>
The land lies open to the raging east,<br/>
Then, bending like a bow, with rocks compress'd,<br/>
Shuts out the storms; the winds and waves complain,<br/>
And vent their malice on the cliffs in vain.<br/>
The port lies hid within; on either side<br/>
Two tow'ring rocks the narrow mouth divide.<br/>
The temple, which aloft we view'd before,<br/>
To distance flies, and seems to shun the shore.<br/>
Scarce landed, the first omens I beheld<br/>
Were four white steeds that cropp'd the flow'ry field.<br/>
'War, war is threaten'd from this foreign ground,'<br/>
My father cried, 'where warlike steeds are found.<br/>
Yet, since reclaim'd to chariots they submit,<br/>
And bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit,<br/>
Peace may succeed to war.' Our way we bend<br/>
To Pallas, and the sacred hill ascend;<br/>
There prostrate to the fierce Virago pray,<br/>
Whose temple was the landmark of our way.<br/>
Each with a Phrygian mantle veil'd his head,<br/>
And all commands of Helenus obey'd,<br/>
And pious rites to Grecian Juno paid.<br/>
These dues perform'd, we stretch our sails, and stand<br/>
To sea, forsaking that suspected land.
</p>
<p>
"From hence Tarentum's bay appears in view,<br/>
For Hercules renown'd, if fame be true.<br/>
Just opposite, Lacinian Juno stands;<br/>
Caulonian tow'rs, and Scylacaean strands,<br/>
For shipwrecks fear'd. Mount Aetna thence we spy,<br/>
Known by the smoky flames which cloud the sky.<br/>
Far off we hear the waves with surly sound<br/>
Invade the rocks, the rocks their groans rebound.<br/>
The billows break upon the sounding strand,<br/>
And roll the rising tide, impure with sand.<br/>
Then thus Anchises, in experience old:<br/>
''Tis that Charybdis which the seer foretold,<br/>
And those the promis'd rocks! Bear off to sea!'<br/>
With haste the frighted mariners obey.<br/>
First Palinurus to the larboard veer'd;<br/>
Then all the fleet by his example steer'd.<br/>
To heav'n aloft on ridgy waves we ride,<br/>
Then down to hell descend, when they divide;<br/>
And thrice our galleys knock'd the stony ground,<br/>
And thrice the hollow rocks return'd the sound,<br/>
And thrice we saw the stars, that stood with dews around.<br/>
The flagging winds forsook us, with the sun;<br/>
And, wearied, on Cyclopian shores we run.<br/>
The port capacious, and secure from wind,<br/>
Is to the foot of thund'ring Aetna join'd.<br/>
By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high;<br/>
By turns hot embers from her entrails fly,<br/>
And flakes of mounting flames, that lick the sky.<br/>
Oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown,<br/>
And, shiver'd by the force, come piecemeal down.<br/>
Oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow,<br/>
Fed from the fiery springs that boil below.<br/>
Enceladus, they say, transfix'd by Jove,<br/>
With blasted limbs came tumbling from above;<br/>
And, where he fell, th' avenging father drew<br/>
This flaming hill, and on his body threw.<br/>
As often as he turns his weary sides,<br/>
He shakes the solid isle, and smoke the heavens hides.<br/>
In shady woods we pass the tedious night,<br/>
Where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright,<br/>
Of which no cause is offer'd to the sight;<br/>
For not one star was kindled in the sky,<br/>
Nor could the moon her borrow'd light supply;<br/>
For misty clouds involv'd the firmament,<br/>
The stars were muffled, and the moon was pent.
</p>
<p>
"Scarce had the rising sun the day reveal'd,<br/>
Scarce had his heat the pearly dews dispell'd,<br/>
When from the woods there bolts, before our sight,<br/>
Somewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite,<br/>
So thin, so ghastly meager, and so wan,<br/>
So bare of flesh, he scarce resembled man.<br/>
This thing, all tatter'd, seem'd from far t'implore<br/>
Our pious aid, and pointed to the shore.<br/>
We look behind, then view his shaggy beard;<br/>
His clothes were tagg'd with thorns, and filth his limbs besmear'd;<br/>
The rest, in mien, in habit, and in face,<br/>
Appear'd a Greek, and such indeed he was.<br/>
He cast on us, from far, a frightful view,<br/>
Whom soon for Trojans and for foes he knew;<br/>
Stood still, and paus'd; then all at once began<br/>
To stretch his limbs, and trembled as he ran.<br/>
Soon as approach'd, upon his knees he falls,<br/>
And thus with tears and sighs for pity calls:<br/>
'Now, by the pow'rs above, and what we share<br/>
From Nature's common gift, this vital air,<br/>
O Trojans, take me hence! I beg no more;<br/>
But bear me far from this unhappy shore.<br/>
'Tis true, I am a Greek, and farther own,<br/>
Among your foes besieg'd th' imperial town.<br/>
For such demerits if my death be due,<br/>
No more for this abandon'd life I sue;<br/>
This only favour let my tears obtain,<br/>
To throw me headlong in the rapid main:<br/>
Since nothing more than death my crime demands,<br/>
I die content, to die by human hands.'<br/>
He said, and on his knees my knees embrac'd:<br/>
I bade him boldly tell his fortune past,<br/>
His present state, his lineage, and his name,<br/>
Th' occasion of his fears, and whence he came.<br/>
The good Anchises rais'd him with his hand;<br/>
Who, thus encourag'd, answer'd our demand:<br/>
'From Ithaca, my native soil, I came<br/>
To Troy; and Achaemenides my name.<br/>
Me my poor father with Ulysses sent;<br/>
(O had I stay'd, with poverty content!)<br/>
But, fearful for themselves, my countrymen<br/>
Left me forsaken in the Cyclops' den.<br/>
The cave, tho' large, was dark; the dismal floor<br/>
Was pav'd with mangled limbs and putrid gore.<br/>
Our monstrous host, of more than human size,<br/>
Erects his head, and stares within the skies;<br/>
Bellowing his voice, and horrid is his hue.<br/>
Ye gods, remove this plague from mortal view!<br/>
The joints of slaughter'd wretches are his food;<br/>
And for his wine he quaffs the streaming blood.<br/>
These eyes beheld, when with his spacious hand<br/>
He seiz'd two captives of our Grecian band;<br/>
Stretch'd on his back, he dash'd against the stones<br/>
Their broken bodies, and their crackling bones:<br/>
With spouting blood the purple pavement swims,<br/>
While the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs.
</p>
<p>
"'Not unreveng'd Ulysses bore their fate,<br/>
Nor thoughtless of his own unhappy state;<br/>
For, gorg'd with flesh, and drunk with human wine<br/>
While fast asleep the giant lay supine,<br/>
Snoring aloud, and belching from his maw<br/>
His indigested foam, and morsels raw;<br/>
We pray; we cast the lots, and then surround<br/>
The monstrous body, stretch'd along the ground:<br/>
Each, as he could approach him, lends a hand<br/>
To bore his eyeball with a flaming brand.<br/>
Beneath his frowning forehead lay his eye;<br/>
For only one did the vast frame supply;<br/>
But that a globe so large, his front it fill'd,<br/>
Like the sun's disk or like a Grecian shield.<br/>
The stroke succeeds; and down the pupil bends:<br/>
This vengeance follow'd for our slaughter'd friends.<br/>
But haste, unhappy wretches, haste to fly!<br/>
Your cables cut, and on your oars rely!<br/>
Such, and so vast as Polypheme appears,<br/>
A hundred more this hated island bears:<br/>
Like him, in caves they shut their woolly sheep;<br/>
Like him, their herds on tops of mountains keep;<br/>
Like him, with mighty strides, they stalk from steep to steep<br/>
And now three moons their sharpen'd horns renew,<br/>
Since thus, in woods and wilds, obscure from view,<br/>
I drag my loathsome days with mortal fright,<br/>
And in deserted caverns lodge by night;<br/>
Oft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see<br/>
Of the huge Cyclops, like a walking tree:<br/>
From far I hear his thund'ring voice resound,<br/>
And trampling feet that shake the solid ground.<br/>
Cornels and salvage berries of the wood,<br/>
And roots and herbs, have been my meager food.<br/>
While all around my longing eyes I cast,<br/>
I saw your happy ships appear at last.<br/>
On those I fix'd my hopes, to these I run;<br/>
'Tis all I ask, this cruel race to shun;<br/>
What other death you please, yourselves bestow.'
</p>
<p>
"Scarce had he said, when on the mountain's brow<br/>
We saw the giant shepherd stalk before<br/>
His following flock, and leading to the shore:<br/>
A monstrous bulk, deform'd, depriv'd of sight;<br/>
His staff a trunk of pine, to guide his steps aright.<br/>
His pond'rous whistle from his neck descends;<br/>
His woolly care their pensive lord attends:<br/>
This only solace his hard fortune sends.<br/>
Soon as he reach'd the shore and touch'd the waves,<br/>
From his bor'd eye the gutt'ring blood he laves:<br/>
He gnash'd his teeth, and groan'd; thro' seas he strides,<br/>
And scarce the topmost billows touch'd his sides.
</p>
<p>
"Seiz'd with a sudden fear, we run to sea,<br/>
The cables cut, and silent haste away;<br/>
The well-deserving stranger entertain;<br/>
Then, buckling to the work, our oars divide the main.<br/>
The giant harken'd to the dashing sound:<br/>
But, when our vessels out of reach he found,<br/>
He strided onward, and in vain essay'd<br/>
Th' Ionian deep, and durst no farther wade.<br/>
With that he roar'd aloud: the dreadful cry<br/>
Shakes earth, and air, and seas; the billows fly<br/>
Before the bellowing noise to distant Italy.<br/>
The neighb'ring Aetna trembling all around,<br/>
The winding caverns echo to the sound.<br/>
His brother Cyclops hear the yelling roar,<br/>
And, rushing down the mountains, crowd the shore.<br/>
We saw their stern distorted looks, from far,<br/>
And one-eyed glance, that vainly threaten'd war:<br/>
A dreadful council, with their heads on high;<br/>
(The misty clouds about their foreheads fly;)<br/>
Not yielding to the tow'ring tree of Jove,<br/>
Or tallest cypress of Diana's grove.<br/>
New pangs of mortal fear our minds assail;<br/>
We tug at ev'ry oar, and hoist up ev'ry sail,<br/>
And take th' advantage of the friendly gale.<br/>
Forewarn'd by Helenus, we strive to shun<br/>
Charybdis' gulf, nor dare to Scylla run.<br/>
An equal fate on either side appears:<br/>
We, tacking to the left, are free from fears;<br/>
For, from Pelorus' point, the North arose,<br/>
And drove us back where swift Pantagias flows.<br/>
His rocky mouth we pass, and make our way<br/>
By Thapsus and Megara's winding bay.<br/>
This passage Achaemenides had shown,<br/>
Tracing the course which he before had run.
</p>
<p>
"Right o'er against Plemmyrium's wat'ry strand,<br/>
There lies an isle once call'd th' Ortygian land.<br/>
Alpheus, as old fame reports, has found<br/>
From Greece a secret passage under ground,<br/>
By love to beauteous Arethusa led;<br/>
And, mingling here, they roll in the same sacred bed.<br/>
As Helenus enjoin'd, we next adore<br/>
Diana's name, protectress of the shore.<br/>
With prosp'rous gales we pass the quiet sounds<br/>
Of still Elorus, and his fruitful bounds.<br/>
Then, doubling Cape Pachynus, we survey<br/>
The rocky shore extended to the sea.<br/>
The town of Camarine from far we see,<br/>
And fenny lake, undrain'd by fate's decree.<br/>
In sight of the Geloan fields we pass,<br/>
And the large walls, where mighty Gela was;<br/>
Then Agragas, with lofty summits crown'd,<br/>
Long for the race of warlike steeds renown'd.<br/>
We pass'd Selinus, and the palmy land,<br/>
And widely shun the Lilybaean strand,<br/>
Unsafe, for secret rocks and moving sand.<br/>
At length on shore the weary fleet arriv'd,<br/>
Which Drepanum's unhappy port receiv'd.<br/>
Here, after endless labours, often toss'd<br/>
By raging storms, and driv'n on ev'ry coast,<br/>
My dear, dear father, spent with age, I lost:<br/>
Ease of my cares, and solace of my pain,<br/>
Sav'd thro' a thousand toils, but sav'd in vain<br/>
The prophet, who my future woes reveal'd,<br/>
Yet this, the greatest and the worst, conceal'd;<br/>
And dire Celaeno, whose foreboding skill<br/>
Denounc'd all else, was silent of the ill.<br/>
This my last labour was. Some friendly god<br/>
From thence convey'd us to your blest abode."
</p>
<p>
Thus, to the list'ning queen, the royal guest<br/>
His wand'ring course and all his toils express'd;<br/>
And here concluding, he retir'd to rest.

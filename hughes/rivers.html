<h1>The Negro Speaks of Rivers</h1>
<h2>by Langston Hughes</h2>
<p>
I’ve known rivers:<br/>
I’ve known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins.
</p>
<p>
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.
</p>
<p>
I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.<br/>
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.<br/>
I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.<br/>
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans, and I’ve seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset.
</p>
<p>
I’ve known rivers:<br/>
Ancient, dusky rivers.
</p>
<p>
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

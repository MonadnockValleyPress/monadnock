<h1>Sonnets from the Portuguese</h1>
<h2>by Elizabeth Barrett Browning</h2>
<h3>XXV</h3>
<p>
A heavy heart, Belovëd, have I borne<br/>
From year to year until I saw thy face,<br/>
And sorrow after sorrow took the place<br/>
Of all those natural joys as lightly worn<br/>
As the stringed pearls, each lifted in its turn<br/>
By a beating heart at dance-time.  Hopes apace<br/>
Were changed to long despairs, till God's own grace<br/>
Could scarcely lift above the world forlorn<br/>
My heavy heart.  Then thou didst bid me bring<br/>
And let it drop adown thy calmly great<br/>
Deep being!  Fast it sinketh, as a thing<br/>
Which its own nature does precipitate,<br/>
While thine doth close above it, mediating<br/>
Betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate.

<h1>Sonnets from the Portuguese</h1>
<h2>by Elizabeth Barrett Browning</h2>
<h3>XXXIV</h3>
<p>
With the same heart, I said, I'll answer thee<br/>
As those, when thou shalt call me by my name&mdash;<br/>
Lo, the vain promise! is the same, the same,<br/>
Perplexed and ruffled by life's strategy?<br/>
When called before, I told how hastily<br/>
I dropped my flowers or brake off from a game.<br/>
To run and answer with the smile that came<br/>
At play last moment, and went on with me<br/>
Through my obedience.Â  When I answer now,<br/>
I drop a grave thought, break from solitude;<br/>
Yet still my heart goes to thee&mdash;ponder how&mdash;<br/>
Not as to a single good, but all my good!<br/>
Lay thy hand on it, best one, and allow<br/>
That no child's foot could run fast as this blood.

<h1>Sonnets from the Portuguese</h1>
<h2>by Elizabeth Barrett Browning</h2>
<h3>VII</h3>
<p>
The face of all the world is changed, I think,<br/>
Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul<br/>
Move still, oh, still, beside me, as they stole<br/>
Betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink<br/>
Of obvious death, where I, who thought to sink,<br/>
Was caught up into love, and taught the whole<br/>
Of life in a new rhythm.Â  The cup of dole<br/>
God gave for baptism, I am fain to drink,<br/>
And praise its sweetness, Sweet, with thee anear.<br/>
The names of country, heaven, are changed away<br/>
For where thou art or shalt be, there or here;<br/>
And this . . . this lute and song . . . loved yesterday,<br/>
(The singing angels know) are only dear<br/>
Because thy name moves right in what they say.

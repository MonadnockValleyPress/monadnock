<h1>Sonnets from the Portuguese</h1>
<h2>by Elizabeth Barrett Browning</h2>
<h3>XLI</h3>
<p>
I thank all who have loved me in their hearts,<br/>
With thanks and love from mine.  Deep thanks to all<br/>
Who paused a little near the prison-wall<br/>
To hear my music in its louder parts<br/>
Ere they went onward, each one to the mart's<br/>
Or temple's occupation, beyond call.<br/>
But thou, who, in my voice's sink and fall<br/>
When the sob took it, thy divinest Art's<br/>
Own instrument didst drop down at thy foot<br/>
To harken what I said between my tears, . . .<br/>
Instruct me how to thank thee!  Oh, to shoot<br/>
My soul's full meaning into future years,<br/>
That they should lend it utterance, and salute<br/>
Love that endures, from life that disappears!

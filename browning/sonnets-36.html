<h1>Sonnets from the Portuguese</h1>
<h2>by Elizabeth Barrett Browning</h2>
<h3>XXXVI</h3>
<p>
When we met first and loved, I did not build<br/>
Upon the event with marble.  Could it mean<br/>
To last, a love set pendulous between<br/>
Sorrow and sorrow?  Nay, I rather thrilled,<br/>
Distrusting every light that seemed to gild<br/>
The onward path, and feared to overlean<br/>
A finger even.  And, though I have grown serene<br/>
And strong since then, I think that God has willed<br/>
A still renewable fear . . . O love, O troth . . .<br/>
Lest these enclaspëd hands should never hold,<br/>
This mutual kiss drop down between us both<br/>
As an unowned thing, once the lips being cold.<br/>
And Love, be false! if he, to keep one oath,<br/>
Must lose one joy, by his life's star foretold.

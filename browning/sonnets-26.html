<h1>Sonnets from the Portuguese</h1>
<h2>by Elizabeth Barrett Browning</h2>
<h3>XXVI</h3>
<p>
I lived with visions for my company<br/>
Instead of men and women, years ago,<br/>
And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know<br/>
A sweeter music than they played to me.<br/>
But soon their trailing purple was not free<br/>
Of this world's dust, their lutes did silent grow,<br/>
And I myself grew faint and blind below<br/>
Their vanishing eyes.  Then thou didst come&mdash;to be,<br/>
Belovëd, what they seemed.  Their shining fronts,<br/>
Their songs, their splendours, (better, yet the same,<br/>
As river-water hallowed into fonts)<br/>
Met in thee, and from out thee overcame<br/>
My soul with satisfaction of all wants:<br/>
Because God's gifts put man's best dreams to shame.

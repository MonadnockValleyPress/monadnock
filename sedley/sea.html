<h1>Love Still Has Something of the Sea</h1>
<h2>by Charles Sedley</h2>
<p>
Love still has something of the sea,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From whence his Mother rose;<br/>
No time his slaves from doubt can free,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor give their thoughts repose.
</p>
<p>
They are becalm'd in clearest days,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in rough weather tost;<br/>
They wither under cold delays,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or are in tempests lost.
</p>
<p>
One while they seem to touch the port,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then straight into the main<br/>
Some angry wind in cruel sport<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their vessel drives again.
</p>
<p>
At first disdain and pride they fear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, if they chance to 'scape,<br/>
Rivals and falsehood soon appear<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a more dreadful shape.
</p>
<p>
By such degrees to joy they come,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are so long withstood,<br/>
So slowly they receive the sum,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hardly does them good.
</p>
<p>
'Tis cruel to prolong a pain;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to defer a joy,<br/>
Believe me, gentle Celemene,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offends the winged boy.
</p>
<p>
An hundred thousand oaths your fears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps would not remove,<br/>
And if I gaz'd a thousand years,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could no deeper love.
</p>

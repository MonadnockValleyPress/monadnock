<h1>To Cloris</h1>
<h2>by Charles Sedley</h2>
<p>
Cloris, I cannot say your eyes<br/>
Did my unwary heart surprise;<br/>
Nor will I swear it was your face,<br/>
Your shape, or any nameless grace:<br/>
For you are so entirely fair,<br/>
To love a part, injustice were;<br/>
No drowning man can know which drop<br/>
Of water his last breath did stop;<br/>
So when the stars in heaven appear,<br/>
And join to make the night look clear;<br/>
The light we no one's bounty call,<br/>
But the obliging gift of all.<br/>
He that does lips or hands adore,<br/>
Deserves them only, and no more;<br/>
But I love all, and every part,<br/>
And nothing less can ease my heart.<br/>
Cupid, that lover, weakly strikes,<br/>
Who can express what 'tis he likes.

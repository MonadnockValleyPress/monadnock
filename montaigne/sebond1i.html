<h1>Apology for Raymond Sebond</h1>
<h2>by Michel de Montaigne (1588)</h2>
<h2>translated by John Florio (1603)</h2>

<p>This discourse
hath drawne me to the consideration of the senses, wherein consisteth the
greatest foundation and triall of our ignorance. Whatsoever is knowne,
is without peradventure knowne by the faculty of the knower: for, since
the judgment commeth from the operation of him that judgeth, reason requireth
that he performe and act this operation by his meanes and will, and not
by others compulsion: as it would follow if wee knew things by the force,
and according to the law of their essence. Now all knowledge is addressed
unto us by the senses: they are our maisters:
<blockquote> -----via qua munita fidei
<br>Proxima fert humanum in pectus, templaque mentis./1</blockquote>

<blockquote>Whereby a way for credit leads well-linde
<br>Into man's breast and temple of his minde.</blockquote>
Science begins by them and in them is resolved. After all, we should
know no more then a stone, unlesse we know that here is sound, smell, light,
savor, measure, weight, softnesse, hardnesse, sharpnesse, colour, smoothnesse,
breadth and depth. Behold here the platforme of all the frame and
principles of the building of all our knowledge. And according to
some, science is nothing 1 LUCR. 1. v. 102.
<hr>&lt;Mont2-346>
MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>else but what is knowne by the senses. Whosoever can force me
to contradict my senses, hath me fast by the throate, and cannot make me
recoyle one foote backward. The senses are the beginning and end
of humane knowledge.
<blockquote>Invenies primis ab sensibus esse creatam
<br>Notitiam veri, neque sensus posse refelli.
<br>Quid maiore fide porro, guam sensus, haberi
<br>Debet/1</blockquote>

<blockquote>You shall finde knowledge of the truth at first was bred
<br>From our first senses, nor can senses be misseled. What, then
our senses, should
<br>With us more credit hold?</blockquote>
 Attribute as little as may be unto them, yet must
this ever be graunted them, that all our instruction is addressed by their
meanes and intermission. Cicero saith that Chrysippus having assaid
to abate the power of his senses, and of their vertue, presented contrary
arguments unto himselfe, and so vehement oppositions, that he could not
satisfie himselfe. Whereupon Carneades (who defended the contrary
part boasted that he used the very same weapons and words of Chrysippus
to combate against him and therefore cried out upon him, 'Oh miserable
man! thine owne strength hath foiled thee. There is no greater absurditie
in our judgment, then to maintaine that fire heateth not, that light shineth
not, that in iron there is neither weight nor firmenesse, which are notices
our senses bring unto us: Nor beliefe or science in man, that may
be compared unto that, in certaintie. The first consideration I have
upon the senses subject is, that I make a question, whether man be provided
of all naturall senses, or no. I see divers creatures that live an
entire and perfect life, some without sight, and some without hearing;
who knoweth whether we also want either one, two, three, or many senses
more: For, if we want any one, our discourse cannot discover the
want or defect thereof. It is the senses priviledge to be the
<br>-----
<br>1 LUCR. 1. iv. 480, 484.
<hr>THE SECOND BOOKE
&lt;Mont2-347>
<p>extreme bounds of our perceiving. There is nothing beyond them
that may stead us to discover them: No one sense can discover another.
<blockquote>An poterunt oculos aures reprehendere, an aures
<br>Tactus, an hunc porro tactum sapor arguet oris,
<br>An confutabunt nares, oculive revincent?/1</blockquote>

<blockquote>Can eares the eyes, or can touch reprehend
<br>The cares, or shall mouthes taste that touch amend?
<br>Shall our nose it confute,
<br>Or eyes gainst it dispute?</blockquote>
 They all make the extreamest line of our facultie.
<blockquote> ------seorsum cuique potestas
<br>Divisa est, sua vis cuique est./2</blockquote>

<blockquote>To teach distinctly might
<br>Is shar'de, each hath its right.</blockquote>
 It is impossible to make a man naturally blind,
to conceive that he seeth not; impossible to make him desire to see, and
sorrow his defect. Therefore ought we not to take assurance that
our mind is contented and satisfied with those we have, seeing it hath
not wherewith to feel her owne malady, and perceive her imperfection, if
it be in any It is impossible to tell that blind man any thing, either
by discourse, argument, or similitude, that lodgeth any apprehension of
light, colour, or sight in his imagination. There is nothing more
backward that may push the senses to any evidence. The blind-borne,
which we perceive desire to se, it is not to understand what they require;
they have learnt of us that something they want, and something they desire,
that is in us, with the effects and consequences thereof, which they call
good: yet wot not they what it is, nor apprehend they it neere or far.
I have seene a gentleman of a good house, borne blind, at least blind in
such an age that he knowes not what sight is; he understandeth so little
what he wanteth, that as we doe, he useth words fitting sight, and applieth
them after a manner onely proper and

<p>peculiar to himselfe. A child being brought before him to whom
he was god-father, taking him in his armes, he said, 'Good Lord, what a
fine child this is! it is a goodly thing to see him. What a cherefull
countenance he hath! how prettily he looketh!' He will say as one of us,
'This hall hath a faire prospect. It is very faire weather, The Sunne
shines cleare. Nay, which is more: because hunting, hawking, tennis-play,
and shuting at buts are our common sports and exercises (for so he hath
heard) his mind will be so affected unto them, and he wil so busie himselfe
about them, that he will thinke to have as great an interest in them as
any of us, and shew himselfe as earnestly passionate, both in liking and
disliking them, as any else; yet doth be conceive and receive them but
by hearing. If he be in a faire champion ground, where he may ride, they
will tell him, yonder is a Hare started, or the Hare is killed, he is as
busily earnest of his game as he heareth others to be that have perfect
sight. Give him a ball, he takes it in the left hand, and with the
right strikes it away with his racket; in a piece he shutes at randome;
and is well pleased with what his men tell him, be it high or wide.
Who knowes whether mankind commit as great a folly, for want of some sense,
and that by this default the greater part of the visage of things be concealed
from us? Who knowes whether the difficulties we find in sundry of
Natures workes proceede thence? And whether diverse effects of beasts,
which exceed our capacitie, are produced by the facultie of some sense
that we want? And whether some of them have by that meane a fuller
and more perfect life then ours? We seize on an apple wel nigh with
all our senses; we find rednesse, smoothnesse, odor and sweetnesse in it;
besides which, it may have other vertues, either drying or binding, to
which we have no sense to be referred. The proprieties which in many
things we call secret, as in the Adamant to draw iron, is it not likely
there should be sensitive faculties in nature able to judge and perceive
them, the want whereof breedeth in us the ignorance of the true
<hr>THE SECOND BOOKE
&lt;Mont2-349>
<p>essence of such things? It is happily some particular sense that
unto cockes or chanticleares discovereth the morning and midnight houre,
and moveth them to crow: that teacheth a hen, before any use or experience,
to feare a hawke and not a goose or a peacocke, farre greater birds: that
warneth yong chickins of the hostile qualitie which the cat hath against
them, and not to distrust a dog; to strut and arme themselves against the
mewing of the one (in some sort a flattering and milde voice) and not against
the barking of the other (a snarling and quarrelous voice): that instructeth
rats, wasps, and emmets, ever to chuse the best cheese and fruit, having
never tasted them before: and that addresseth the stag, the elephant, and
the serpent, to the knowledge of certaine herbs and simples, which, being
either wounded or sicke, have the vertue to cure them. There is no
sense but hath some great domination, and which by his meane affordeth
not an infinite number of knowledges. If we were to report the intelligence
of sounds, of harmony and of the voice, it would bring an imaginable confusion
to all the rest of our learning and science. For, besides what is
tyed to the proper effect of every sense, how many arguments, consequences,
and conclusions draw we unto other things, by comparing one sense to another?
Let a skilfull, wise man but imagine humane nature to be originally produced
without sight and discourse, how much ignorance and trouble such a defect
would bring unto him, and what obscurity and blindnesse in our mind.
By that shall we perceive how much the privation of one, or two, or three
such senses (if there be any in us) doth import us about the knowledge
of truth. We have by the consultation and concurrence of our five
senses formed one Verity, whereas peradventure there was required the accord
and consent of eight or ten senses, and their contribution, to attaine
a perspicuous insight of her, and see her in her true essence. Those
Sects which combate mans science, doe principally combate the same by the
uncertainty and feeblenesse of our senses. For, since by their
<hr>&lt;Mont2-350>
MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>meane and intermission all knowledge comes unto us, if they chance to
misse in the report they make unto us, if either they corrupt or alter
that, which from abroad they bring unto us, if the light which by them
is transported into our soule be obscured in the passage, we have nothing
else to hold by. From this extreme difficultie are sprung all these
phantazies, which everie subject containeth, whatsoever we finde in it,
that it hath not what we suppose to finde in it, and that of the Epicurians,
which is; that the sunne is no greater than our sight doth judge it<i>:</i>
<blockquote>Quicquid id est, nihilo fertur maiore figura,
<br>Quam nostris oculis quam cernimus esse videtur:/1
<p>Whate'er it be, it in no greater forme doth passe,
<br>Then to our eyes, which it behold, it seeming was:</blockquote>
that the apparances, which represent a great body to him that is neare
unto it, and a much lesser to him that is further from it, are both true:
<blockquote>Nec tamen hic oculis falli concedimzus hilum: Proinde
animi vitium hoc oculis adfingere noli:/2</blockquote>

<blockquote>Yet graunt we not, in this, our eyes deceiv'd or blind, Impute
not then to eyes this error of the mind:</blockquote>
and resolutely, that there is no deceit in the senses that a man must stand
to their mercy, and elsewhere seek reasons to excuse the difference and
contradiction we find in them: yea invent all other untruthes and raving
conceits (so farre come they) rather than accuse the senses. Timagoras
swore, that howsoever he winked or turned his eyes, he could never perceive
the light of the candle to double: and that this seeming proceeded from
the vice of opinion, and not from the instrument. Of all absurdities
the most absurd amongst the Epicurians is to disavow the force and effect
of the senses.
<blockquote>Proinde quod in quoque est his visum tempore, verum est:
Et si non potuit ratio dissolvere causam,
<br>Cur ed quae fuerint iuxtim quadrata, procul sint</blockquote>

<br>Quam manibus manifesta suis emittere quoquam,
<br>Et violare fidem primam, et convellere tota
<br>Fundamenta, quibus nixatur vita salusque.
<br>Non modo enim ratio ruat omnis, vita quoque ipsa
<br>Concidat extemplo, nisi credere sensibus ausis, Praecipitesque locos

<br>In genere hoc fugienda./1</blockquote>

<blockquote>What by the eyes is seene at any time, is true,
<br>Though the cause treason could not render of the view,
<br>Why, what was square at hand, a farre off seemed round,
<br>Yet it much better were, that wanting reasons ground
<br>The causes of both formes we harp-on, but not hit,
<br>Then let slip from our hands things cleare, and them omit,
<br>And violate our first beliefe, and rashly rend
<br>All those grounorkes, whereon both life and health depend,
<br>For not alone all reason falls, life likewise must
<br>Faile out of hand, unlesse your senses you dare trust,
<br>And breake-neeke places, and all other errours shunne,
<br>From which we in this kinde most carefully should runne.</blockquote>
 This desperate and so little Philosophicall counsell,
represents no other thing but that humane science cannot be maintained
but by unreasonable, fond and mad reason; yet is it better that man use
it to prevaile, yea and of all other remedies else how phantasticall soever
they be, rather than avow his necessarie foolishnesse.: So prejudiciall
and disadvantageous a veritie he cannot avoide, but senses must necessarily
be the Soveraigne maisters of his knowledge; but they are uncertaine and
falsifiable to all circumstances. There must a man strike to the
utmost of his power, and if his just forces faile him (as they are wont)
to use and employ obstinacie, temeritie and impudencie. If that which
the Epicurians affirme, be true, that is to say, we have no science, if
the apparances of the senses be false, and that which the Stoicks say,
if it is also true that the senses apparences are so false as they can
produce us no science; we will conclude at the charges of these two great
Dogmatist Sects, that there is no science. Touching

and deceits they use towards us. And the echoing or reporting of
a valleys the sound of a trumpet seemeth to sound before us, which cometh

 To roule a bullet under the fore finger, the midlemost
being put over it, a man must very much enforce himselfe to affirme there
is but one, so assuredly doth our sense present us two. That the
senses do often maister our discourse, and force it to receive impressions
which he knoweth and judgeth to be false, it is daily seene. I leave
the sense of feeling which hath his functions neerer more quicke and substantiall,
and which by the effect of the griefe or paine it brings to the body doth
so often confound and re-enverse all these goodly<a NAME="Stoicall1"></a><b>
Stoicall+</b> resolutions, and enforceth to cry out of the bellyache him
who hath with all resolution established in his mind this doctrine, that
the cholike, as every other sicknesse or paine, is a thing indifferent,
wanting power to abate any thing of soveraigne good or chiefe felicity,
wherein the wise man is placed by his owne vertue: there is no heart so

<p>the sweetnesse and harmony of musicke will move and tickle; nor any
soule so skittish and stubborne, that hath not a feeling of some reverence
in considering the clowdy vastitie and gloomie canapies of our churches,
the eye-pleasing diversitie of ornaments, and orderly order of our ceremonies,
and hearing the devout and religious sound of our organs, the moderate,
symphonicall, and heavenly harmonie of our voices: even those that enter
into them with an obstinate will and contemning minde have in their hearts
a feeling of remorse, of chilnesse and horrour, that puts them into a certaine
diffidence of their former opinions. As for me, I distrust mine owne
strength to heare with a settled minde some of Horace or Catullus verses
sung with a sufficiently well tuned voice, uttered by and proceeding from
a faire, yong, and hart-alluring mouth. And Zeno had reason to say
that the voice was the flower of beautie. Some have gone about to
make me beleeve that a man, who most of us French men know, in repeating
of certaine verses he had maide, had imposed upon me that they were not
such in writing as in the aire, and that mine eyes would judge of them
otherwise than mine eares: so much credit hath pronounciation to give price
and fashion to those workes that passe at her mercy; whereupon Philoxenus
was not to be blamed, when hearing one to give an ill accent to some composition
of his, he tooke in a rage some of his pots or bricks, and breaking them,
trode and trampled them under his feet, saying unto him, 'I breake and
trample what is thine, even as thou manglest and marrest what is mine.
Wherefore did they (who with an undanted resolve have procured their owne
death, because they would not see the blow or stroke comming) turne their
face away? And those who for their health's sake cause themselves
to be cut and cauterized, why cannot they endure the sight of the preparations,
tooles, instruments and workes of the Chirurgion, since the sight can have
no part of the paine or smart? Are not these fit examples to verifie
the authoritie which senses have over discourse? We may long enough

reason. For in that there is nothing of its owne.

<p> Let a Philosopher be put in a cage made of
small and thin- set iron wire, and hanged on the top of our Ladies Church
steeple in Paris; he shall, by evident reason, perceive that it is impossible
he should fall down out of it: yet can he not choose (except he have beene
brought up to the trade of tilers or thatchers) but the sight of that exceeding
height must needs dazle his sight, and amaze or turne his senses.
For we have much ado to warrant our selves in the walks or battlements
of a high tower or steeple, if they be hattlemented and wrought with pillars,
and somewhat wide one from another, although of stone and never so strong.
Nay, some there are that call scarcely think or heare of such heights.
Let a beame or planke be laid acrosse from one of those two steeples to
the other, as big, as thick, as strong, and as broad as would suffice any
man to walke safely upon it, there is no philosophicall wisdome of so great
resolution and constancie that is able to encourage and perswade us to
march upon it, as we would were it below on the ground. I have sometimes
made triall of it upon our mountaines on this side of Italie, yet am I
one of those that will not easily be affrighted with such things, and I
could not without horror to my minde and trembling of legs and thighes
endure to looke on those infinite precipices and steepy downe-fals, though
I were not neere the brim, nor any danger within my length and more; and
unlesse I had willingly gone to the perill, I could not possibly have falne.
Where I also noted that how deep soever the bottome were, if but a tree,
a shrub, or any out-butting crag of a rock presented it selfe unto our
eyes upon those steepe and high Alpes, somewhat to uphold the sight; and
divide the same, it doth somewhat ease and assure us from feare, as if
it were a thing which in our fall might either helpe or upheld us: and
that we cannot without some dread and giddinesse in the head so much as
abide to looke upon one of those even and downe- right precipices:
Vt despici sine vertigine simul oculorum animique non possit: 'So as they
cannot looke downe without giddinesse both of
<hr>&lt;Mont2-356>
MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>eyes and mindes: which is an evident deception of the sight. Therefore
was it that a worthy Philosopher pulled out his eyes that so he might discharge
his soule of the seducing and diverting he received by them, and the better
and more freely apply himselfe unto Philosophy. But by this accompt,
he should also have stopped his eares, which (as Theopbrastus said) are
the most dangerous instruments we have to receive violent and sodaine impressions
to trouble and alter us, and should in the end have deprived himself of
all his other senses; that is to say, both of his being and life.
For they have the power to command our discourses and sway our minde: <i>Fit
etiam saepe specie quadam, saepe vocum gravitate et cantibus, vt pellantur
animi vehementius: saepe etiam cura et timore:/1 </i>'It comes to passe
that many times our mindes are much moved with some shadow, many times
with deep sounding or singing of voices, many times with care and feare.'
Physitians hold that there are certain complexions which by some sounds
and instruments are agitated even unto furie. I have seene some who,
without infringing their patience, could not well heare a bone gnawne under
their table: and we see few men but are much troubled at that sharpe, harsh,
and teeth-edging noise that smiths make in filing of brasse, or scraping
of iron and steele together: others will be offended if they but heare
one chew his meat somewhat aloud; nay, some will be angrie with or hate
a man that either speaks in the nose or rattles in the throat. That
piping prompter of Gracchus, who mollified, raised, and wound his masters
voice whilst be was making orations at Rome; what good did he if the motion
and qualitie of the sound had not the force to move and efficacy to alter
the auditories judgement: Verily there is great cause to make so
much ado, and keepe such a coyle about the constancie and firmnesse of
this goodly piece, which suffers it selfe to be handled, changed, and turned
by the motion and accident of so light a winde. The very same cheating
and cozening that senses bring to our

<p>understanding, themselves receive it in their turnes. Our mind
doth likewise take revenge of it, they lie, they cog, and deceive one another
a vie. What we see and heare, being passionately transported by anger,
we neither see nor heare it as it is.
<blockquote>Et solem geminum, et duplices se ostendere Thebas./1</blockquote>

<blockquote>That two Sunnes doe appeare,
<br>And double Thebes are there.</blockquote>
The object which we love seemeth much more fairer unto us then it is:
<blockquote>Multimodis igitur pravos turpesque videmus
<br>Esse in delitiis, summoque in honore vigere:/2</blockquote>

<blockquote>We therefore see that those, who many waies are bad,
<br>And fowle, are yet belov'd, and in chiefe honour had;</blockquote>
and that much fowler which we loath. To a pensive and heart- grieved
man a cleare day seemes gloomie and duskie. Our senses are not onely
altered but many times dulled, by the passions of the mind. How many
things see we, which we perceive not, if our mind be either busied or distracted
elsewhere?
<blockquote> ------in rebus quoque apertis
noscere possis,
<br>Si non advertas animum, proinde esse, quasi omni
<br>Tempore semotae fuerint, longeque remotae./3</blockquote>

<blockquote>Ev'n in things manifest it may be seene,
<br>If you marke not, they are, as they had beene
<br>At all times sever'd farre, remooved cleane.</blockquote>
 The soule seemeth to retire her selfe into the
inmost parts, and ammuseth the senses faculties: so that both the inward
and outward parts of man are full of weaknes and falshood. Those
which have compared our life unto a dreame, have happily had more reason
so to doe then they were aware. When we dreame, our soule liveth,
worketh and exerciseth all her faculties, even and as much as when it waketh;
and if more softly and obscurely, yet verily not so, as that it may admit
so

<p>great a difference as there is betweene a dark night and a cleare day:
yea as betweene a night and a shadow: there it sleepeth, here it slumbreth:
more or lesse they are ever darknesses, yea Cimmerian darknesses.
We wake sleeping, and sleep waking. In my sleep I see not so cleare;
yet can I never find my waking cleare enough, or without dimnesse.
Sleepe also, in his deepest rest, doth sometimes bring dreames asleepe:
but our waking is never so vigilant as it may clearely purge and dissipate
the ravings or idle phantasies which are the dreames of the waking, and
worse then dreames. Our reason and soule, receiving the phantasies
and opinions, which sleeping seize on them, and authorising our dreames
actions, with like approbation, as it doth the daies, why make we not a
doubt whether our thinking and our working be another dreaming, and our
waking some kind of sleeping? If the senses be our first judges,
it is not ours that must only be called to counsell: for, in this facultie,
beasts have as much (or more) right as we. It is most certaine that
some have their hearing more sharpe than man; others their sight; others
their smelling; others their feeling, or taste. Democritus said that
Gods and beasts had the sensitive faculties much more perfect than man.
Now, betweene the effects of their senses and ours the difference is extreame.
Our spettle cleanseth and drieth our sores, and killeth serpents.

<br>For oft a Serpent toucht with spettle of a man
<br>Doth die, and gnaw it selfe with fretting all he can.</blockquote>
 What qualitie shall we give unto spettle, either
according to us or according to the serpent? by which two senses shall
we verifie its true essence, which we
<br>-----

<p>seeke for? Pliny saith that there are certaine seahares in India
that to us are poison, and we bane to them; so that we die if we but touch
them; now whether is man or the sea-hare poison? Whom shall we beleeve,
either the fish of man or the man of fish? Some quality of the ayre
infecteth man which nothing at all hurteth the one: some other the oxe,
and not man: which of the two is, either in truth or nature, the pestilent
quality? Such as are troubled with the yellow jandise deeme all things
tey looks upon to be yellowish, which seeme more pale and wan to them then
to us.
<blockquote>Lurida praeterea fiunt quaecunque tuentur
<br>Arquati./1</blockquote>

<blockquote>And all that jaundis'd men behold,
<br>They yellow straight or palish hold.</blockquote>
 Those which are sicke of the disease which phisitians
call Hyposphagma, which is a suffusion of blood under the skin, imagine
that all things they see are bloodie and red. Those humours that
so change the sights operation, what know we whether they are predominant
and ordinarie in beasts? For we see some whose eyes are as yellow
as theirs that have the jandise, others that have them all blood-shotten
with rednesse: it is likely that the objects collour they looke upon seemeth
otherwise to them then to us: which of the two judgements shall be true?
For it is not said that the essence of things hath reference to man alone.
Hardnesse, whitenesse, depth, and sharpnesse touch the service and concerne
the knowledge of beasts as well as ours: Nature hath given the use
of them to them as well as to us. When we winke a little with our
eye, wee perceive the bodies we looke upon to seeme longer and outstretched.
Many beasts have their eye as winking as we. This length is then
happily the true forme of that body, and not that which our eyes give it,
being in their ordinarie seate. If we close our eye above, things seeme
double unto us

<br>And faces twaine, and bodies twaine of men</blockquote>
 If our eares chance to be hindred by any thing,
or that the passage of our hearing bee stopt, we receive the sound otherwise
then we were ordinarily wont. Such beasts as have hairie eares, or
that in lieu of an eare have but a little hole, doe not by consequence
heare that we heare, and receive the sound other then it is. We see
at solemn shewes or in theatres that, opposing any collourd glasse betweene
our eyes and the torches light, whatsoever is in the roome seemes or greene,
or yellow, or red unto us, according to the collour of the glasse:
<blockquote>Et vulgo faciunt id lutea russague vela,
<br>Et ferruginea, cum magnis intenta theatris
<br>Per malos volgata trabesque trementia pendent,:
<br>Namque ibi consessum caveat subter, et omnem
<br>Scenai speciem, patrum matrumque deorumque
<br>Inficiunt coguntque suo fluitare colore./2</blockquote>

<blockquote>And yellow, russet, rustic curtained worke this feate
<br>In common sights abroade, where over skaffold's great
<br>Stretched on masts, spred over beames, they hang still waving.
<br>All the seates circuit there, and all the stages braving,
<br>Of fathers, mothers, Gods, and all the circle showe
<br>They double-dye and in their colours make to flowe.</blockquote>
 It is likely that those beasts eyes which we see
to be of divers collours, produce the apparances of those bodies they looke
upon to be like their eyes. To judge the senses operation, it were
then necessary we were first agreed with beasts, and then betweene our
selves; which we are not, that ever-and-anon disputing about that one seeth,
heareth, or tasteth something to be other then indeed it is; and contend
as much as about any thing else, of the diversity of those images our senses
report unto us. A yong child heareth, seeth,
<br>-----
<br>1 LUCR. 1. iv. 452, 454. 2 Ib. 73.
<hr>THE SECOND BOOKE
&lt;Mont2-361>
<p>and tasteth otherwise, by natures ordinary rule, then a man of thirtie
yeares; and he otherwise then another of threescore. The senses are
to some more obscure and dimme, and to some more open and quicke.
We receive things differently, according as they are and seeme unto us.
Things being then so uncertaine and full of controversie, it is no longer
a wonder if it be told us that we may avouch snow to seeme white unto us;
but to affirme that it's such in essence and in truth, we cannot warrant
ourselves: which foundation being so shaken, all the science in the world
must necessarily goe to wracke. What, doe our senses themselves hinder
one another? To the sight a picture seemeth to be raised aloft, and
in the handling flat: shall we say that muske is so pleasing or no, which
comforteth our smelling and offendeth our taste? There are hearbs
and ointments which to some parts of the body are good, and to other some
hurtfull. Honie is pleasing to the taste, but unpleasing to the sight.
Those jewefl wrought and fashioned like feathers or sprigs, which in impreses
are called feathers without ends, no eye can discerne the bredth of them,
and no man warrant himselfe from this deception, that on the one end or
side it groweth not broder and broder, sharper and sharper, and on the
other more and more narrow, especially being rouled about ones finger,
when notwithstanding in handling it seemeth equal in bredth, and every
where alike. Those who to encrease and aide their luxury were anciently
wont to use perspective or looking glasses, fit to make the object they
represented appeare very big and great, that so the members they were to
use might, by that ocular increase, please them the more: to whether of
the two senses yeelded they, either to the sight presenting those members
as big and great as they wisht them, or to the feeling that presented them
little and to be disdained? Is it our senses that lend these diverse
conditions unto subjects, when for all that the subjects have but one?
as we see in the Bread we eat: it is but Bread, but one using it, it maketh
bones, blood, flesh, haire, and nailes thereof:

<blockquote>Ut cibus in membra atque artus cum diditur omnes
<br>Disperit, atque aliam naturam sufficit ex se./1</blockquote>

<blockquote>As meate distributed into the members, dies,
<br>Another nature yet it perishing supplies.</blockquote>
The moistnesse which the roote of a tree suckes becomes a trunke, a leafe,
and fruite: And the aire being but one, applied unto a trumpet, becommoth
diverse in a thousand sorts of sounds. Is it our senses (say I) who
likewise fashion of diverse qualities those subjects, or whether they have
them so and such? And upon this doubt, what may wee conclude of their
true essence? Moreover, since the accidents of sicknesse, of madnesse,
or of sleepe, make things appeare other unto us then they seeme unto the
healthy, unto the wise, and to the waking: is it not likely that our right
seate and naturall humors have also wherewith to give a being unto things,
having reference unto their condition, and to appropriate them to it selfe,
as doe inordinate humors; and our health as capable to give them his visage
as sicknesse? Why hath not the temperate man some forme of the objects
relative unto himselfe as the intemperate: and shall not he likewise imprint
his character in them? The distasted impute wallowishnes unto wine:
the healthier good taste; and the thirsty, brisknesse, rellish, and dellicacie.
Now our condition appropriating things unto it selfe, and transforming
them to its owne humour: wee know no more how things are in sooth and truth;
for nothing comes unto us but falsified and altered by our senses.
Where the compasses, the quadrant, or the ruler are crooked, all proportions
drawne by them, and all the buildings erected by their measure, are also
necessarily defective and imperfect. The uncertaintie of our senses
yeelds what ever they produce, also uncertaine.
<blockquote>Denique ut in fabrica, si prava est regula prima,
<br>Normaque si fallax rectis regionibus exit,
<br>Et libella aliqua si ex parte claudicat hilum,
<br>Omnia mendose fieri, atque obstipa necessum EST,</blockquote>

<br>And all this as betrayde
<br>By judgements formost laid.
<br>Of things the reason therefore needs must faultie bee
<br>And false, which from false senses drawes its pedigree.</blockquote>
As for the rest, who shall bee a competent Judge in these differences?
As wee said in controversies of religion, that we must have a judge inclined
to either party, and free from partialitie, or affection, which is hardly
to be had among Christians; so hapneth it in this: For if he be old
he cannot judge of ages sense, himself being a party in this controversie:
and so if he be yong, healthy, sicke, sleeping, or waking, it is all one:
We had need of some body void and exempted from all these qualities, that
without any preoccupation of judgement might judge of these propositions
as indifferent unto him: by which accompt we should have a judge that were
no man. To judge of the apparances that we receive of subjects, we
had need have a judicatorie instrument: to verifie this instrument we should
have demonstration; and to approve demonstration, an instrument; thus are
we ever turning round. Since the senses cannot determine our disputation,
themselves being so full of uncertainty, it must then be reason: and no
reason can be astiblished without another reason: then are we ever going
backe unto infinity. Our phantasie doth not apply it selfe to strange
things, but is rather conceived by the interposition of senses; and senses
cannot comprehend a strange subject; nay, not so much as their owne
<br>-----

MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>passions: and so, nor the phantasie, nor the apparence is the subject's,
but rathier the passion's only, and sufferance of the sense: which passion
and subject are divers things: Therefore, who judgeth by apparences,
judgeth by a thing different from the subject. And to say that the
senses' passions referre the qualitie of strange subjects by resemblance
unto the soule: How can the soule and the understanding rest assured of
that resemblance, having of it selfe no commerce with forraigne subjects?
Even as he that knowes not Socrates, seeing his picture, cannot say that
it resembleth him. And would a man judge by apparences, be it by
all it is impossible; for by their contraries and differences they hinder
one another, as we see by experience. May it be that some choice
apparences rule and direct the others? This choice must be verified
by another choice, the second by a third: and so shal we never make an
end. In few, there is no constant existence, neither of our being,
nor of the objects. And we and our judgement and all mortall things
else do uncessantly rowle, turns and passe away. Thus can nothing be certainely
established, nor of the one nor of the other; both the judgeing and the
judged being in continuall alteration and motion.

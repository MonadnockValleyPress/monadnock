<h1>Apology for Raymond Sebond</h1>
<h2>by Michel de Montaigne (1588)</h2>
<h2>translated by Charles Cotton (circa 1686)</h2>
<h3>Part VI: That Man's Knowledge Cannot Make Him Good</h3>
<p>As life renders itself by simplicity more pleasant, so more innocent and better, also it renders it as I was saying before: 'The simple and ignorant,' says St. Paul, 'raise themselves up to heaven and take possession of it; and we, with all our knowledge, plunge ourselves into the infernal abyss.' I am neither swayed by Valentinian, a professed enemy to all learning and letters, nor by Licinius, both Roman emperors, who called them the poison and pest of all political government; nor by Mahomet, who, as 'tis said, interdicted all manner of learning to his followers; but the example of the great Lycurgus, and his authority, with the reverence of the divine Lacedemonian policy, so great, so admirable, and so long flourishing in virtue and happiness, without any institution or practice of letters, ought certainly to be of very great weight. Such as return from the new world discovered by the Spaniards in our fathers' days, testify to us how much more honestly and regularly those nations live, without magistrate and without law, than ours do, where there are more officers and lawyers than there are of other sorts of men and business:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  Di cittatorie piene, e di libelli,<br/>
  D'esamine, e di carte di procure,<br/>
  Hanno le mani e il seno, e gran fastelli<br/>
  Di chioge, di consigli, et di letture:<br/>
  Per cui le faculta de* poverelli<br/>
  Non sono mai nelle citt sicure;<br/>
  Hanno dietro e dinanzi, e d'ambi i lati,<br/>
  Notai, procuratori, ed avvocati.
  <br/><br/>
  Their bags were full of writs, and of citations,<br/>
  Of process, and of actions and arrests,<br/>
  Of bills, of answers, and of replications,<br/>
  In courts of delegates, and of requests,<br/>
  To grieve the simple sort with great vexations;<br/>
  They had resorting to them as their guests,<br/>
  Attending on their circuit, and their journeys,<br/>
  Scriv'ners, and clerks, and lawyers, and attorneys.

<p>It was what a Roman senator of the latter ages said, that their predecessors' breath stunk of garlic, but their stomachs were perfumed with a good conscience; and that, on the contrary, those of his time were all sweet odour without, but stunk within of all sorts of vices; that is to say, as I interpret it, that they abounded with learning and eloquence, but were very defective in moral honesty. Incivility, ignorance, simplicity, roughness, are the natural companions of innocence; curiosity, subtlety, knowledge, bring malice in their train; humility, fear, obedience, and affability, which are the principal things that support and maintain human society, require an empty and docile soul, and little presuming upon itself.</p>
<p>Christians have a particular knowledge, how natural and original an evil curiosity is in man; the thirst of knowledge, and the desire to become more wise, was the first ruin of man, and the way by which he precipitated himself into eternal damnation. Pride was his ruin and corruption. 'Tis pride that diverts him from the common path, and makes him embrace novelties, and rather choose to be head of a troop, lost and wandering in the path of error; to be a master and a teacher of lies, than to be a disciple in the school of truth, suffering himself to be led and guided by the hand of another, in the right and beaten road. 'Tis, peradventure, the meaning of this old Greek saying, that superstition follows pride, and obeys it as if it were a father: [&mdash;Greek&mdash;] Ah, presumption, how much dost thou hinder us?</p>
<p>After that Socrates was told that the god of wisdom had assigned to him the title of sage, he was astonished at it, and, searching and examining himself throughout, could find no foundation for this divine judgment. He knew others as just, temperate, valiant, and learned, as himself; and more eloquent, more handsome, and more profitable to their country than he. At last he concluded that he was not distinguished from others, nor wise, but only because he did not think himself so; and that his God considered the opinion of knowledge and wisdom as a singular absurdity in man; and that his best doctrine was the doctrine of ignorance, and simplicity his best wisdom. The sacred word declares those miserable among us who have an opinion of themselves: 'Dust and ashes,' says it to such, 'what hast thou wherein to glorify thyself?' And, in another place, 'God has made man like unto a shadow,' of whom who can judge, when by removing the light it shall be vanished! Man is a thing of nothing.</p>
<p>Our force is so far from being able to comprehend the divine height, that, of the works of our Creator, those best bear his mark, and are with better title his, which we the least understand. To meet with an incredible thing is an occasion to Christians to believe; and it is so much the more according to reason, by how much it is against human reason. If it were according to reason, it would be no more a miracle; and if it were according to example, it would be no longer a singular thing. <em>Melius scitur Deus nesdendo</em>: 'God is better known by not knowing him,' says St. Austin: and Tacitus, <em>Sanctius est ac reverentius de actis Deorum credere, quam scire</em>; 'it is more holy and reverent to believe the works of God than to know them;' and Plato thinks there is something of impiety in inquiring too curiously into God, the world, and the first causes of things: <em>Atque illum quidem parentem hujus universitaiis invenire, difficile; et, quum jam inveneris, indicare in vulgtis, nefas</em>: 'to find out the parent of the world is very difficult; and when found out, to reveal him to the vulgar is sin,' says Cicero. We talk indeed of power, truth, justice; which are words that signify some great thing; but that thing we neither see nor conceive at all. We say that God fears, that God is angry, that God loves,</p>
<blockquote>
  Immortalia mortali sermone notantes.
  <br/><br/>
  Giving to things immortal mortal names.
 </blockquote>
<p>These are all agitations and emotions that cannot be in God, according to our form, nor can we imagine them, according to his. It only belongs to God to know himself, and to interpret his own works; and he does it in our language, going out of himself, to stoop to us who grovel upon the earth.  How can prudence, which is the choice between good and evil, be properly attributed to him whom no evil can touch? How can reason and intelligence, which we make use of, to arrive by obscure at apparent things; seeing that nothing is obscure to him? How justice, which distributes to every one what appertains to him, a thing begot by the society and community of men, how is that in God? How temperance, which is the moderation of corporal pleasures, that have no place in the Divinity? Fortitude to support pain, labour, and dangers, as little appertains to him as the rest; these three things have no access to him. For which reason Aristotle holds him equally exempt from virtue and vice: <em>Neque gratia, neque ira teneri potest; quod quo talia essent, imbecilla essent omnia?</em> 'He can neither be affected with favour nor indignation, because both these are the effects of frailty.'</p>
<p>The participation we have in the knowledge of truth, such as it is, is not acquired by our own force: God has sufficiently given us to understand that, by the witnesses he has chosen out of the common people, simple and ignorant men, that he has been pleased to employ to instruct us in his admirable secrets. Our faith is not of our own acquiring; 'tis purely the gift of another's bounty: 'tis not by meditation, or by virtue of our own understanding, that we have acquired our religion, but by foreign authority and command wherein the imbecility of our own judgment does more assist us than any force of it; and our blindness more than our clearness of sight: 'tis more by the mediation of our ignorance than of our knowledge that we know any thing of the divine wisdom. 'Tis no wonder if our natural and earthly parts cannot conceive that supernatural and heavenly knowledge: let us bring nothing of our own, but obedience and subjection; for, as it is written, 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe?  Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.'</p>

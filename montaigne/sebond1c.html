<h1>Apology for Raymond Sebond</h1>
<h2>by Michel de Montaigne (1588)</h2>
<h2>translated by John Florio (1603)</h2>

I have in a manner unawares half engaged my selfe in the second
objection, to which I had purposed to frame an answer for Sebond.
Some of his arguments are weake and simple to verifie what he would, and
undertake to front him easily. Such fellowes must somewhat more roughly
be handled, for they are more dangerous and more malicious than the first.
Man doth willingly apply other mens sayings to the advantage of the opinions
be hath fore-judged in himselfe. 'To an Atheist all writings make for Atheisme.
He with his owne venome infecteth the innocent matter. These have
some preoccupation of judgment that makes their taste wallowish and tastelesse,
to conceive the reasons of Sebond. As for the rest, they thinke to
have faire play offered them if they have free liberty to combat our religion
with meere worldly weapons; which they durst not charge, did they behold
her in her majesty, full of authority and commandement. The meanes
I use to suppresse this frenzy,, and which seemeth the fittest for my purpose,
is to crush and trample this humane pride and fiercenesse under foot, to
make them feele the emptinesse, vacuitie, and no worth of man: and violently
to pull out of their hands the silly weapons of their reason; to make them
stoope, and bite and snarle at the ground, under the authority and reverence
of God's Majesty. Onely to her belongeth science and wisdome, it
is she alone can judge of her selfe; and from her we steale whatsoever
we repute, value, and count ourselves to be.

MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p> Let us suppress this overweening, the first
foundation of the tyrannie of the wicked spirit. Deus superbis resistit:
humilibus autem dat gratiam: 'God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace
to the humble. Plato saith 'that intelligence is in all the Gods,
but little or nothing at all in men. Meanewhile it is a great comfort
unto a Christian man to see our mortall implements and fading tooles so
fitly sorted to our holy and divine faith; that when they are employed
to the mortal and fading subjects of their nature, they are never more
forcible nor more joyntlie appropriated unto them. Let us then see
whether man hath an other stronger reasons in his power then Sebondes,
and whether it be in him, by argument or discourse, to come to any certainty.
For, St. Augustine, pleading against these kind of men, because he
would upbraid them with their injustice, in that they hold the parts of
our beleefe to be false, and that our reason faileth in establishing them:
and to shew that many things may be, and have beene, whereof our discourse
can never ground the nature and the causes: he proposeth and setteth downe
before them certaine knowen and undoubted experiments, wherein man confesseth
to see nothing, which he doth as all things else, with a curious and ingenious
search. More must be done, and they must be taught, that to convince the
weaknesse of their reason we need not go far to cull out rare examples.
And that it is so defective and blinde, as there is no facility so clear
that is clear enough unto her: that easie and uneasie is all one to her;
that all subjects equally, and Nature in generall disavoweth her jurisdiction
and interposition. What preacheth truth unto us, when it biddeth
us flie and shun worldly philosophy; when it so often telleth us 'that
all our wisdome is but folly before God; that of all vanities man is the
greatest; that man, who presumeth of his knowledge, doth not yet know what
knowledge is: and that man, who is nothing, if he but thinke to be something,
seduceth and deceiveth bimselfe? These sentences of the Holy Ghost
do so lively and manifestly

<p>expresse what I would maintaine, as I should neede no proofe against
such as with all submission and obeysance would yeeld to his authority.
But these will needs be whipt to their owne cost, and cannot abide their
reason to be combatted, but by itselfe. Let us now but consider man
alone without other help, armed but with his own weapons, and unprovided
of the grace and knowledge of God, which is all his honour, all his strength,
and all the ground of his being. Let us see what hold-fast or free-
bold he hath in this gorgeous and goodly equipage. Let him with the
utmost power of his discourse make me understand upon what foundation he
hath built those great advantages and ods he supposeth to have over other
creatures. Who hath perswaded him that this admirable moving of heavens
vaults, that the eternal light of these lampes so fiercely rowling over
his head, that the horror-moving and continnall motion of this infinite
vaste ocean were established, and continue so many ages for his commoditie
and service? Is it possible to imagine anything so ridiculous as this miserable
and wretched creature, which is not so much as master of himselfe, exposed
and subject to offences of all things, and yet dareth call himselfe Master
and Emperour of this Universe? In whose power it is not to know the
least part of it., much lesse to command the same. And the Privileges
which he so fondly challengeth to be the onely absolute creature in this
huge worlds frame, perfectly able to know the absolute beautie and several
parts thereof, and that he is only of power to yeeld the great architect
thereof due thanks for it, and to keepe account both of the receipts and
layings out of the world. Who hath sealed him his patent? Let
him shew us his letters of privilegefor so noble and so great a charge.
Have they been granted onely in favour of the wise? Then concerne
they but a few. Are the foolish and wicked worthy of so extraordinary
a favour, who being the worst part of the world, should they be preferred
before the rest? Shall we believe him: Quorum igitur causa
quis dixerit effectum esse mundum?

<p>Eorum scilicet animantium quo ratione utuntur<i>. Hi sunt dii
et homines, quibus profecto nihil est melius:/1 </i>'For whose cause then
shall a man say that the world was made?' In sooth, for those creatures
sake which have the use of reason; those are Gods and men, than whom assuredly
nothing is better. We shall never sufficiently baffle the impudency
of this conjoyning. But silly wretch, what hath he in him worthie
such an advantage? To consider the incorruptible life of the celestiall
bodies, their beauty, greatnesse, and agitation, continued with so just
and regular a course.
<blockquote> ------ cum suspicimus magni

<blockquote>When we of this great world the heavenly temples see
<br>Above us, and the skies with shine-starres fixt to be,
<br>And marks in our discourse,
<br>Of Sunne and Moone the course.</blockquote>
To consider the power of domination these bodies have not onely upon our
lives and condition of our fortune.
<blockquote>Facta etenim et vitas hominum suspendit ab astris./3</blockquote>

<blockquote>For on the stars he doth suspend
<br>Of men, the deeds, the lives, and end.</blockquote>
 But also over our dispositions and inclinations,
our discourses and wils, which they rule, provoke, and move at the pleasure
of their influences, as our reason finds and teacheth us.
<blockquote> ------ speculataque longe
<br>Deprendit tacitis dominantia legibus astra.
<br>Et totum alterna mundum ratione moveri,
<br>Fatorumque vices certis discernere signis./4</blockquote>

<blockquote>By speculation it from far discerns,
<br>How stars by secret lawes do guide our sterns,
<br>And this whole world is moov'd by entercourse
<br>And by sure signes of fates to know the course.</blockquote>

 If our vertue, vices, sufficiency and knowledge,
and the same discourse we make of the power of the starres, and the comparison
betweene them and us, commeth as our reason judgeth by their meane and
through their favour;
<blockquote> -----furit

<br>Such war is not our owne, forc't are we to it,
<br>Drawne to our owne paines, our owne limbs to teare
<br>Fates so t'observe t'is fatall, we must doe it</blockquote>
 If we hold that portion of reason, which we have
from the distribution of heaven, how can she make us equall unto it?
How can she submit his essence and conditions unto our knowledge?
Whatsoever we behold in those high bodies doth affright us:<i>Quae molitio,
quae ferramenta, qui vectes, quo machinae, qui ministri tanti operis fuerunt?/3
</i>'What
workmanship? What yron- braces? What maine beames, what engines?

<blockquote>What masons and carpenters were to so great a worke?
<br>Why doe we then deprive them of soule, of life, and of discourse?</blockquote>
Have we discovered or knowen any unmoveable or insensible stupidity in
them? We, who have no commerce but of obedience with them?
Shall we say we have seene the use of a reasonable soule in no other creature
but in man? What? Have we seene anything comparable to the
sunne? Leaveth he to be, because we have seene nothing semblable
unto it? And doth he leave his moving because his equall is nowhere
to be found? If that which we have not seene is not, our knowledge
is that wonderfull abridged. Quae sunt tantae, animi angustia? 'What
narrownesse of my heart is such? Be they not dreames of humane vanity,
to make a celestiall earth or world of the moone, as Anaxagoras did?
And therein to plant habitations, and as Plato and Plutarch doe, erect
their colonies for our use. And to make of our knowne earth a bright
shining planet? <i>Inter caetera mortalitatis incommoda, et hoc est caligo
mentium: nec tantum necessitas errandi, sed errorum amor</i>:/1 'Among
other discommodities of our mortality this is one, there is darknesse in
our minds, and in us not onely necessity of erring, but a love of errors.'
<i>Corruptibile
corpus aggravat animam, et deprimit terrena inhabitatio sensum multa cogitantem</i>:/2
XXX'Our corruptible body doth overlode our soule, and our dwelling on earth
weighs downe our sense that is set to thinke of many matters.'

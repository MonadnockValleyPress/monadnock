<h1>Apology for Raymond Sebond</h1>
<h2>by Michel de Montaigne (1588)</h2>
<h2>translated by John Florio (1603)</h2>
<h3>Part VIII: That Man Can Have No Knowledge</h3>

The liberty then, and the jollity of their ancient
spirits brought forth many different Sects of opinions, in Philosophy and
humane Sciences: every one undertaking to judge and chuse, so he might
raise a faction. But now that men walke all one way:<i> Qui certis
quibusdam destinatisque sententiis addicti et consecrate sunt, ut etiam
quae non probant, cogantur defendere</i>:/1 'Who are addicted and
consecrated to certaine set and fore-decreed opinions, so as they are enforced
to maintaine those things which they prove or approve not:' And that wee
receive Arts by civill authority and appointment: so that Schooles have
but one patterne, alike circumscribed discipline and institution; no man
regardeth more what coines weigh and are worth; but every man in his turne
receiveth them according to the value that common approbation and succession
allotteth them: Men dispute no longer of the alloy, but of the use.
So are all things spent and vented like. Physike is received as Geometry:
and jugling tricks, encjantments, bonds, the commerce of deceased spirits,
prognostications, domifications, yea even this ridiculous wit and wealth-consuming
pursuite of the Philosophers stone, all is emploied and uttered without
contradiction. It sufficeth to know that Mars his place lodgeth in
the middle of the hands triangle; that of Venus in the thumme; and Mercuries
in the little finger: and when the table-line cutteth the fore- finger's
rising, it is a signe of cruelty: when it falleth under the middle finger,
and that the naturall median-line makes an angle with the vitall, under
the same side, it is a signe of a miserable death: and when a womans naturall
line is open, and closes not its angle with the vitall, it evidenty denotes
that she will not be very chast. I call your selfe to witnesse, if
with this Science onely, a man may not passe with reputation and favour
among all companies. Theophrastus was wont to say that mans knowledge,
directed by the sense, might judge of the causes of things unto 1 CIC.

MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>a certaine measure, but being come to the extream and first causes,
it must necessarily stay, and be blunted or abated, either by reason of
its weaknesse or of the things difficulty. It is an indifferent and
pleasing kind of opinion to thinke that our sufficiency may bring us to
the knowledge of some things, and hath certaine measures of power beyond
which it's temerity to employ it. This opinion is plausible and brought
in by way of composition: but it is hard to give our spirit any limits,
being very curious and greedy, and not tied to stay rather at a thousand
then at fifty spaces. Having found by experience that if one had
mist to attaine unto some one thing, another hath come unto it, and that
which one age never knew, the age succeeding hath found out: and that Sciences
and Arts are not cast in a mold, but rather by little and little formed
and shaped by often handling and polishing them over: even as beares fashion
their yong whelps by often licking them: what my strength cannot discover,
I cease not to sound and try: and in handling and kneading this new matter,
and with removing and chasing it, I open some faculty for him that shall
follow me, that with more ease he may enjoy the same, and make it more
facile, more supple and more pliable:
<blockquote> -----vt hymettia sole
<br>Cera remollescit, tractataque pollice, multas
<br>Vertitur in facies, ipsoque fit vtilis vsu./1</blockquote>

<blockquote>As the best Bees wax melteth by the Sun,
<br>And handling, into many formes doth run,
<br>And is made aptly fit
<br>For use by using it.</blockquote>
 As much will the second do for the third, which
is a cause that difficulty doth not make me despaire, much lesse my unability:
for it is but mine owne. Man is as well capable of all things as
of some. And if (as Theophrastus saith) he avow the ignorance of the first
causes and beginnings, let him boldly quit all the rest of his knowledge.
If his foundation faile him, his
<br>-----
<br>1 OVID. Metam. 1. x. 284.
discourse is overthrowne. The dispute hath no other scope, and
to enquire no other end but the principles: If this end stay not
his course, he casteth himself into an infinite irresolution. Non
potest aliud alio magis minusque comprehendi, quoiam omnium reram vna est
definitio comprehendendi: 'One thing can neither more nor lesse be comprehended
than another, since of all things there is one definition of comprehending.
Now it is likely that if the soule knew any thing, shee first know her
selfe: and if she knew any without and besides her selfe, it must be her
vaile and body before any thing else. If even at this day the Gods
of Physicke are seene to wrangle about our Anatomie,
<blockquote>Mulciber in Troiam, pro Troia stabat Apollo,/1</blockquote>

<blockquote>Apollo stood for Troy,
<br>Vulcan Troy to destroy,</blockquote>
when shall we expect that they will be agreed? We are neerer unto
our selves, then is whitenesse unto snow or weight unto a stone.
If man know not himselfe, how can hee know his functions and forces?
It is not by fortune that some true notice doth not lodge with us but by
hazard. And forasmuch as by the same way, fashion and conduct, errours
are received into our soule, she hath not wherewithall to distinguish them,
nor whereby to chose the truth from falshood. The Academikes received
some inclination of judgment and found it over raw, to say, it was no more
likely snow should be white then blacke, and that wee should be no more
assured of the moving of a stone, which goeth from our hand, then of that
of the eighth Spheare. And to avoid this difficultie and strangenesse,
which in truth cannot but hardly lodge in our imagination, howbeit they
establish that we were no way capable of knowledge, and that truth is engulfed
in the deepest Abysses, where mans sight can no way enter; yet avowed they
some things to be more likely and possible then others, and receivd this
faculty in their judgement

MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>that they might rather incline to one apparence then to another.
They allowed her this propension, interdicting her all resolution.
The Pyrrhonians advise is more hardy, and therewithall more likely.
For this Academicall inclination, and this propension rather to one then
another proposition, what else is it then a recognition of some more apparant
truth, in this than in that? If our understanding be capable of the
forme, of the lineaments, of the behaviour and face of truth, it might
as well see it all compleat, as but halfe, growing and imperfect.
For this apparance of verisimilitude which makes them rather take the left
then the right hand, doe you augment it; this one ounce of likelihood,
which turnes the ballance, doe you multiply it by a hundred, nay by a thousand
ounces; it wil in the end come to passe that the ballance will absolutely
resolve and conclude one choice and perfect truth. But how doe they
suffer themselves to be made tractable by likelihood, if they know not
truth? How know they the semblance of that whereof they understand
not the essence? Either we are able to judge absolutely, or absolutely
we cannot. If our intellectuall and sensible faculties are without
ground or footing, if they but hull up and downe and drive with the wind,
for nothing suffer we our judgment to be carried away to any part of their
operation, what apparauce soever it seemeth to present us with. And
the surest and most happy situation of our understanding should be that,
where without any tottering or agitation it might maintaine it selfe setled,
upright and inflexible<i>. Inter visa, vera, aut falsa, ad animi
assensum, nihil interest:/1</i>
<br>'There is no difference betwixt true and false visions concerning the
mindes assent.' That things lodge not in us in their proper forme
and essence, and make not their entrance into us of their owne power and
authority, we see it most evidently. For if it were so, we would
receive them all alike: wine should be such in a sicke mans mouth as in
a healthy mans. He whose fingers are chopt through cold, and stiffe
or benummed with
<br>-----
<br>1 CIC. Acad. Qu. 1. iv.
frost, should find the same hardnesse in the wood or iron he might handle,
which another doth. Then strange subjects yeeld unto our mercy, and
lodge with us according to our pleasure. Now if on our part we receive
any thing without alteration, if mans holdfasts were capable and sufficiently
powerfull by our proper meanes to seize on truth, those meanes being common
to all; this truth would successively remove it selfe from one to another.
And of so many things as are in the world, at least one should be found,
that by an universall consent should be beleeved of all. But that
no proposition is seene, which is not controversied and debated amongst
us, or that may not be, declareth plainly that our judgment doth not absolutely
and clearly seize on that which it seizeth: for my judgment cannot make
my fellowes judgment to receive the same: which is a signe that I have
seized upon it by some other meane then by a naturall power in me or other
men. Leave we apart this infinite confusion of opinions, which is
seene amonge Philosophers themselves, and this universal and perpetuall
disputation, in and concerning the knowledge of things. For it is
most truly presupposed that men (I mean the wisest, the best borne, yea
and the most sufficient do never agree; no not so much that heaven is over
our heads. For they who doubt of all, doe also doubt of this: and
such as affirme that we cannot conceive any thing, say we have not conceived
whether heaven be over our heads; which two opinions are in number (without
any comparison) the most forcible. Besides this diversity and infinite
division, by reason of the trouble which our owne judgement layeth upon
our selves, and the uncertainty which every man findes in himselfe, it
may manifestly be perceived that this situation is very uncertaine and
unstaid. How diversely judge we of things? How often change we our
phantasies? What I hold and beleeve this day I beleeve and hold with
all my beleefe: all my implements, springs and motions, embrace and claspe
this opinion, and to the utmost of their power warrant the
<hr>&lt;Mont2-312>
MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>same: I could not possibly embrace any verity, nor with more assurance
keepe it, than I doe this. I am wholy and absolutely given to it:
but hath it not beene my fortune, not once, but a hundred, nay a thousand
times, nay daily, to have embraced some other thing with the very same
instruments and condition which upon better advise I have afterward judged
false? A man should, at the least become wise at his owne cost, and
learne by others harmes. If under this colour I have often found
my selfe deceived, if my Touch-stone be commonly found false and my ballance
un-even and unjust; what assurance may I more take of it at this time than
at others? Is it not folly in me to suffer my selfe so often to be
beguiled and couzened by one guide? Neverthelesse, let fortune remove
us five hundred times from our place, let her doe nothing but incessantly
empty and fill, as in a vessell, other and other opinions in our mind,
the present and last is alwaies supposed certaine and infallible.
For this must a man have goods, honour, life, state, health and all:
<blockquote> -----posterior res illa reperta
<br>Perdit; et immutat sensus ad pristina guaeque./1</blockquote>

<blockquote>The latter thing destroies all found before;
<br>And alters sense at all things lik'd of yore.</blockquote>
 Whatsoever is told us, and what ever we learne,
we should ever remember: it is man that delivereth and man that receiveth:
it is a mortall hand that presents it, and a mortall hand that receives
it. Onely things which come to us from heaven have right and authority
of perswasion and markes of truth: which we neither see with our eyes nor
receive by our meanes: this sacred and great image would be of no force
in so wretched a Mansion except God prepare it to that use and purpose,
unlesse God by his particular grace and supernaturall favor reforme and
strengthen the same. Our fraile and defective condition ought at
least make us demeane our selves more moderately and more circumspectly
in our changes. We should remember that
<br>-----
<br>1 LUCR. 1. v. 1424.
whatsoever we receive in our understanding we often receive false things,
and that it is by the same instruments which many times contradict and
deceive themselves. And no marvell if they contradict themselves,
being so easy to encline, and upon very slight occasions subject to waver
and turne. Certaine it is that our apprehension, our judgement, and
our soules faculties in generall, doe suffer according to the bodies motions
and alterations, which are continuall. Have we not our spirits more
vigilant, our memorie more ready, and our discourses more lively in time
of health then in sicknesse? Doth not joy and blithenesse make us receive
the subjects that present themselves unto our soule, with another kind
of countenance, then lowring vexation and drooping melancholy doth?
Doe you imagine that Catullus or Saphoes verses delight and please an old
covetous chuff-penny wretch as they do a lusty and vigorous yong man?
Cleomenes the sonne of Anaxandridas being sick, his friends reproved him,
saying he had new strange humors and unusuall phantasies: 'It is not unlikely,'
answered he, 'for I am not the man I was wont to be in the time of health;
but being other, so are my fantasies and my humors. In the rabble
case- canvasing of our plea-courts this byword, Gaudeat de bona fortuna:
'Let him joy in his good fortune" is much in use, and is spoken of criminall
offenders, who happen to meete with Judges in some milde temper or well-pleased
mood. For it is most certaine that in times of condemnation the Judges
doome or sentence is sometimes perceived to be more sharpen mercilesse
and forward, and at other times more tractable, facile, and enclined to
shadow or excuse an offence, according as he is well or ill pleased in
mind. A man that commeth out of his house troubled with the paine
of the goute, vexed with jealousy, or angry that his servant hath robbed
him, and whose mind is overcome with griefe, and plunged with vexation,
and distracted with anger, there is not question to be made but his judgement
is at that instant distempred, and much transported that way. That

MONTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>venerable senate of the Areopagites was wont to judge and sentence by
night, for feare the sight of the suters might corrupt justice. The
ayre it selfe, and the clearenes of the firmament, doth forbode us some
change and alteration of weather, as saith that Greek verse in Cicero:
<blockquote>Tales sunt hominum mentes, quali pater ipse
<br>Iupiter auctifera lustravit lampade terras./1</blockquote>

<blockquote>Such are mens mindes, as with increasefull light
<br>Our father Jove survaies the world in sight.</blockquote>
 It is not onely fevers, drinkes and great accidents,
that over-whelme our judgement: the least things in the world will turne
it topsie-turvie. And although we feele it not, it is not to bee
doubted, if a continuall a ague may in the end suppresse our mind, a tertian
will also (according to her measure and proportion) breed some alteration
in it. If an Apoplexie doth altogether stupifie and extinguish the
sight of our understanding, it is not to be doubted but a cold and rheum
will likewise dazle the same. And by consequence, hardly shall a
man in all his life find one houre wherein our judgement may alwaies be
found in his right byase, our body being subject to so many continuall
alterations, and stuft with so divers sorts of ginnes and motions, that,
giving credit to Physitians, it is very hard to find one in perfect plight,
and that doth not alwaies mistake his marke and shute wide. As for
the rest, this disease is not so easily discovered, except it be altogether
extreame and remedilesse; forasmuch as reason marcheth ever crooked, halting
and broken-hipt; and with falshood as with truth; and therefore it is very
hard to discover her mistaking and disorder. I alwaies call reason
that apparance or shew of discourses which every man deviseth or forgeth
in himselfe: that reason, of whose condition there may be a hundred, one
contrary to another, about one selfe same subject: it is an instrument
of lead and wax, stretching, pliable, and that may be fitted to all byases
and squared to all

measures: there remaines nothing but the skill and sufficiency to know
how to turne and winde the same. How well soever a Judge meaneth,
and what good mind so ever he beareth, if diligent care be not given unto
him (to which few ammuse themselves) his inclination unto friendship, unto
kindred, unto beauty, and unto revenge, and not onely matters of so weighty
consequence, but this innated and casual instinct which us to favour one
thing more than another, and encline to one man more than to another, and
which, without any leave or reason, giveth us the choice in two like subjects,
or some shadow of like vanity, may insensibly insinuate in his judgment

and give the ballance a twitch. I that nearest prie into my selfe,

to me within a while after will be paineful. There are a thousand
indiscreet and casuall agitations in me. Either a melancholy humour
possesseth me, or a cholericke passion swaieth me, which having shaken
off, sometimes frowardilesse and peevishnesse hath predominancy, and other
times gladnes and blithnesse overrule me. If I chance to take a booke
in hand I shall in some passages perceive some excellent graces, and which
ever wound me to the soule with delight; but let me lay it by and read
him another time; let me turne and tosse him as I list, let me apply and
manage him as I will, I shall finde it an unknowne and shapelesse masse.
Even in my writings I shall not at all times finde the tracke or ayre of
my first imaginations; I wot not my selfe what I would have said, and shall
vexe and fret my selfe in correcting and giving a new sense to them, because
I have peradventure forgotten or lost the former, which happily was better.

it. Where I encline, thereeI entertains my selfe howsoever it be,

and his knowledge enflamed with all. See then an apparent and undoubted
truth presents it self to his understanding, wherein he discovers a new
light, and believes it in good sooth, and so perswades himselfe.
Shall I tell you? I wot not whether the heate proceedingk of spight
and obstinacie against the impression and violence of a magistrate and
of danger: or the interest of reputation have induced some man to maintaine,
even in the fiery flames, the opinion for which amongst his friends and
at libertie he would never have beene moved nor have ventured his fingers
end. The motions and fits which our soule receiveth by corporall
passions doe greatly prevaile in her, but more her owne, with which it
is so fully possest, as happily it may be maintained she hath no other
or motion than by the blasts of her windes, and that without their agitation
she should remaine without action, as a ship at sea which the winds have
utterly forsaken.<a NAME="Pope5"></a><b><a href="#Pope6">{Pope+</a></b>}

<p> Nor doth any man run violently enough upon
the wicked, or his enemies, except he be throughly angrie; and they are
of opinion that an advocate or counsellor at the barre, to have the cause
goe on his side, and to have justice at the judges hands, doth first endevor
to provoke him to anger. Longing-desires moved Themistocles and urged
Demosthenes, and have provoked Philosophers to long travels, to tedious
watchings, and to lingring peregrinations and leads us to honours, to doctrine,
and to health: all profitable respects. And this demissenes of the
soule in suffering molestion and tediousness, serveth to no other purpose,
but to breed repentance and cause penitence in our consciences, and for
our punishment to feele the scourge of God and the rod of politike correction.
Compassion serveth as a sting unto clemencie, and wisdome to preserve and
governe our selves, is by our owne feare rouzed up; and how many noble
actions by ambition, how many by presumption. To conclude, no eminent
or glorious vertue can be without some immoderate and irregular agitation.<a NAME="Pope6"></a><b>{Pope+</b>}
May not this be one of the reasons which moved the Epicureans to discharge
God of all care and thought of our affaires: forsomuch as the very effects
of his goodnesse cannot exercise themselves towards us without disturbing
his rest by meanes of the<a NAME="passions1"></a><b> passions+</b> which
are as motives and solicitations directing the soule to vertuous actions?
Or have they thought otherwise, and take them as tempests which shamefully
lead astray the soule from her rest and tranquillitie? <i>Vt maris tranquillita
intelligitur, nulla, ne minima quidem, aura fluctus, commovente:
Sic animi quietus et placatus status cernitur, quam perturbatio nulla est,

not so much as the least pirling wind doth stirre the waves, so is a peaceable
reposed state of the mind then seene when there is no perturbation whereby
it may be moved.' What differences of sense and reason, what contrarietie
of imaginations doth the diversitie of our passions present unto us?
What

assurance may we then take of so unconstant and wavering a thing, subject
by its owne condition to the power of trouble, never marching but a forced
and borrowed pace? If our judgement be in the hands of sickenes itselfe
and of perturbation; if by rashnesse and folly it be retained to receive
the impression of things, what assurance may we expect at his hands?
Dares not Philosophie thinke that men produce their greatest effects, and
neerest approaching to divinity when they are besides themselves, furious,
and madde? We amend our selves by the privation of reason, and by
her drooping. The two naturall waies to enter the cabinet of the Gods,
and there to foresee the course of the destinies, are furie and sleepe.
This is very pleasing to be considered. By the dislocation that passions
bring into our reason, we become vertuous; by the extirpation which either
furie or the image of death bringeth us, we become Prophets and Divines.
I never beleeved it more willingly. It is a meere divine inspiration
that sacred truth hath inspired in a Philosophical spirit which against
his proposition exacteth from him; that the quiet state of our soule, the
best-settled estate, yea the healthfullesi that Philosophy can acquire
unto it, is not the best estate. Our vigilancie is more drouzie then
asleepe it selfe: our wisdome lesse wise then folly; our dreames of more
worth then our discourses. The worst place we can take is in ourselves.
But thinks it not that we have the foresight to marke, that the voice which
the spirit uttereth when he is gone from man so cleare sighted, so great,
and so perfect, and whilst he is in man so earthly, so ignorant, and so
overclouded, is a voice proceeding from the spirit which is in earthly,
ignorant, and overclouded man; and therefore a trustles and not to be-believed
voice? I have no great experience in these violent agitations, being
of a soft and dull complexion, the greatest part of which, without giving
it leisure to acknowledge her selfe, doe sodainely surprise our soule.
But that passion, which in young mens harts is saied to be produced by
idleness, although it march but
<hr>&lt;Mont2-320> MONTTAIGNE'S ESSAYES
<p>leasurely and with a measured progress, doth evidently present to those
that have assaid to oppose themselves against her endevour, the power of
the conversion and alteration which our judgement suffereth. I have
some times enterprised to arme my selfe with a resolution to abide, resist,
and suppresse the same. For I am so farre from being in their ranke
that call and allure vices, that unlesse they draw me I scarcely follow
them. I felt it mauger my resistance, to breed, to growe, and to augment;
and in the end, being in perfect health and cleare sighted, to seize upon
and pollute me; in such sort that as in drunkennes the image of things
began to appeare unto me otherwise then it was wont. I saw the advantages
of the subject I sought after evidently to swell and grow greater, and
much to encrease by the winde of my imagination; and the difficulties of
my enterprise to become more easie and plaine, and my discourse and conscience
to shrinke and draw backe. But that fire being evaporated all on
a sodaine, as by the flashing of a lightning, my soule to reassume an other
sight, an other state, and other judgement. The difficultie in my
retreate seemed great and invincible, and the very same things of another
taste and shew than the fervency of desire had presented them unto me.
And which more truly, Pyrrho cannot tell. We are never without some
infirmitie. Fevers have their heat and their cold: from the effects
of a burning passion, we fall into the effects of a chilling passion.
So much as I had cast my selfe forward, so much doe I draw my selfe backe.

Else could I hardly keepe my selfe from continuall rowling. Thus
have I by the Grace of God preserved my selfe whole (without agitation
or trouble of conscience) in the ancient beliefe of our religion, in the
middest of so many sects and divisions which our age hath brought forth.
The writings of the ancient fathers (I meane the good, the solide, and
the serious) doe tempt, and in a manner remove me which way they list.
Him that I heare seemeth ever the most forcible. I finde them everie
one in his turne to have reason, although they contrary one another.
That facility which good witts have to prove any thing they please likel;
and that there is nopthing so strange but that they will undertake to set
so good a gloss on it, as it shall easily deceive a simplicity like unto
mine, doth manifestly shew the weaknesse of their proofe. The heavens
and the planets have moved these three thousand yeares, and all the world
beleeved as much, untill Cleanthes the Samian, or else (according to Theophrastus)
Nicetas the Syracusian tooke upon him to maintaine, it was the earth that
moved, by the oblique circle of the Zodiake, turning about her axell tree.
And in our daies Copernicus hath so well grounded this doctrine, that hee
doth orderly fit it to all astrologicall consequences. What shall
we reape by it but only that wee neede not care which of the two it be?
And who knoweth whether a thousand yeares hence a third opinion will rise,
which happily shall overthrow these two precedents?

 So when any new doctrine is represented unto us,
we have great cause to suspect it, and to consider how, before it was invented,
the contrary unto it was in credit; and as that hath beene reversed by
this latter, a third invention may peradventure succeed in afterages, which
in like sort shall front the second. Before the principles which
Aristotle found out were in credit, other principles contented mans reason
as his doe now content us. What learning have these men, what particular
priviledge, that the course of our invention should rely only upon them,
and that the possession of our beliefe shall for ever hereafter belong
to them? They are no more exempted from being rejected than were
their fore-fathers. If any man urge me with a new argument, it is in me
to imagine that, if I cannot answere it, another can. For, to believe
all apparences which we cannot resolve, is meere<a NAME="simplicitie3"></a><b><a href="#simplicitie4">

have his beliefe turning and winding like a weather-cocke: for, his soule
being soft and without resistance, should uncessantly be enforced to receive
new and admit other impressions: the latter ever defacing the precedents
trace. He that perceiveth himselfe weake, ought to answer, according
to law termes, that he will conferre with his learned counsel, or else

bath only served to kill people. I thinke he will easily verify
it. But I suppose it were no great wisedome to hazard my life upon the
triall of his newfangled experience. 'We must not beleeve all men,' saith
the precept, since every man may say all things. It is not long since
that one of these professours of novelties and physical reformations told
me that all our forefathers had notoriously abused themselves in the nature
and motion of the winds, which, if I should listen unto him, he would manifestly
make me perceive. After I had with some patience given attendance
to his arguments, which were indeed full of likelyhood, I demanded of him
whether they which had sailed according to Theophrastus his lawes, went
westward when they bent their course eastward? Or whether they sailed
sideling or backward? 'It is fortune,' answered he, 'but so it is, they
tooke their marke amisse:' To whom I then replied that I would rather follow
the effects than his reason. They are things that often shock together:
and it hath beene told mee that in geometry (which supposeth to have gained
the high point of certainty amongst all sciences) there are found unavoidable
demonstrations, and which subvert the truth of all experience: as James
Peletier told me in mine owne house, that he had found out two lines bending
their course one towards another, as if they would meet and joyne together;
neverthelesse he affirmed that, even unto infinity, they could never come
to touch one another. And the Pyrrhonians use their arguments, and
reason but to destroy the apparance of experience: and it is a wonder to
see how far the supplenesse of our reason hath in this design followed
them to resist the evidence of effects: for they affirme that we move not,
that we speake not, that there is no weight, nor heat, with the same force
of arguing that we averre the most likeliest things. Ptolomey, who
was an excellent man, had established the bounds of the world; all ancient
philosophers have thought they had a perfect measure thereof, except it
were certaine scattered ilands which might escape their knowledge: it had

<p>beene to Pyrrhonize a thousand yeares agoe, had any man gone about to
make a question of the art of cosmography: and the opinions that have beene
received thereof, of all men in generall: it had beene flat heresie to
avouch that there were Antipodes. See how in our age an infinite
greatnesse of firme land hath beene discovered, not an iland onely, nor
one particular country, but a part in greatnesse very neere equall unto
that which we knew. Our moderne geographers cease not to affirme
that now all is found, and all is discovered:

<blockquote>For what is present here,

The question is now, if Ptolomey was heretofore deceived in the grounds
of his reason, whether it were not folly in me to trust what these late
fellowes say of it, and whether it be not more likely that this huge body
which we terme the world is another manner of thing than we judge it.
Plato saith that it often changeth his countenance, that the heaven, the
starres, and the sunne do sometimes re-enverse the motion we perceive in
them, changing the east into the west. The Aegyptian priests told
Herodotus that since their first king, which was eleaven thousand and odde
yeares (when they made him see the pictures of all their former kings,
drawne to the life in statues) the sun course had changed his course foure
times: that the sea and the earth doe enterchangeably change one into another;
that the worlds birth is undetermined: the like said Aristotle and Cicero.
And some one amongst us averreth that it is altogether eternall, mortal,
and new reviving againe, by many vicissitudes, calling Solomon and Esay
to witnesse: to avoid these oppositions, that God hath sometimes been a
Creator without a creature; that he hath beene idle; that he hath unsaid
his idlenesse by setting his hand to this

worke, and that by consequence he is subject unto change. In the
most famous schooles of Greece, the world is reputed a God framed by another
greater and mightier God, and is composed of a body and a soule, which
abideth in his centre, spreading it selfe by musicall numbers unto his
circumference, divine, thrice happy, very great, most wise and eternall.
In it are other Gods, as the sea, the earth, and planets, which with an
harmonious celestiall dance; sometime meeting, other times farre-sundering
themselves; now hiding, them shewing themselves; and changing place, now
forward, now backward. Heraclitus firmly mainitained that the world
was composed of fire, and by the destinies order it should one day burst
forth into flames, and be so consumed into cinders, and another day it
should be new borne againe. And Apuleius of men saith: <i>Sigillatim
mortales; cunctim perpetui</i>:/1 'Severally mortall; altogether
everlasting.' Alexander writ unto his mother the narration
of an AEgyptian priest, drawne from out their monuments, witnessing the
antiquitie of that nation, infinite; and comprehending the birth and progresse
of their countries to the life. Cicero and Diodorus said in their daies
that the Chaldeans kept a register of foure hundred thousand and odde yeares;
Aristotle, Plinie, and others, that Zoroaster lived sixe thousand yeares
before Plato. And Plato saith that those of the citty of Sais have
memories in writing of eight thousand yeares, and that the towne of Athens
was built a thousand yeares before the citty of Sais. Epicurus, that
at one same time all things that are looke how we see them, they are all
alike, and in the same fashion, in divers other Worlds, which he would
have spoken more confidently had he seene the similitudes and correspondencies
of this new-found world of the West Indiaes with ours, both present and

<p>terrestriall policies I have divers times wondered at my selfe, to see
in so great a distance of times and places, the simpathy or jumping of
so great a number of popular and wilde opinions, and of extravagant customes
and beliefes, and which by no meanes seeme to hold with our naturall discourse.
Man's spirit is a wonderfull worker of miracles. But this relation
hath yet a kind of I wot not what more Heteroclite: which is found both
in names and a thousand other things. For there were found Nations
which (as far as we know) bad never heard of us, where circumcision was
held in request; where great states and commonwealths were maintained onely
by women, and no men: where our fasts and Lent was represented, adding
thereunto the abstinence from women; where our crosses were severall waies
in great esteeme. In some places they adorned and honored their sepulchres
with them, and elsewhere especially that of Saint Andrew, they employed
to shield themselves from nightly visions, and to lay them upon childrens
couches, as good against enchantments and witchcrafts. In another
place they found one made of wood, of an exceeding height, worshipped for
the God of raine; which was thrust very deepe into the ground. There
was found a very expresse and lively image of our Penitentiaries: the use
of Miters, the Priestes single life; the Art of Divination by the entrailes
of sacrificed beasts; the abstinence from all sorts of flesh and fish for
their food; the order amongst Priests, in saying of their divine service,
to use a not vulgar but a particular tongue; and this erroneous and fond
conceipt, that the first God was expelled his throne by a younger brother
of his: that they were at first created with all commodities, which afterward,
by reason of their sinnes, were abridged them: that their territory hath
beene changed; that their naturall condition hath beene much impaired:
that they have heretofore beene drowned by the inundation of Waters come
from heaven; that none were saved but a few families, which cast themselves
into the cracks or hollows of
high Mountaines, which crackes they stoped very close, so that the Waters
could not enter in, having before shut therin many kinds of beasts: that
when they perceived the Raine to cease and Waters to fall, the first sent
out certaine doggs, which returned cleane-washt and wet, they judged that
the waters were not yet much falne; and that afterward sending out some
other, which seeing to returne all muddy and foule, they issued forth of
the mountaines, to repeople the world againe, which they found replenished
onely with Serpents. There were places found where they used the
perswasion of the day of judgement, so that they grew wondrous wroth and
offended with the Spaniards, who in digging and searching of riches in
their graves, scattered here and there the bones of there deceased friends,
saying that those dispersed bones could very hardly be reconjoyned againe.
They also found where they used traffic by exchange, and no otherwise;
and had Faires and Markets for that purpose; they found dwarfes, and such
other deformed creatures, used for the ornament of Princes tables: they
found the use of hawking and fowling according to the nature of their birdes:
tyrannical subsidies, and grievances upon subjects; delicate and pleasant
gardens; dancing, tumbling, leaping, and lugling, musicke of instruments,
armories, dicing-houses, tennisse-courts, and casting lottes, or mumne-chaunce,
wherein they are often so earnest and moody, that they will play themselves
and their liberty: using no other physicke but by charmes: the manner of
writing by figures: beleeving in one first man, universall father of all
people. The adoration of one God, who heretofore lived man in perfect Virginitie,
fasting, and penance, preaching the law of Nature, and the ceremonies of
religion; and who vanished out of the world without any naturall death:

It hath not onely in some sort insinuated it selfe among all infidell Nations
on this side by some imitations, but amongst those barbarous Nations beyond,
as it were by a common and supernaturall inspiration: For amongst
them was also found the beliefe of Purgatory, but after a new forme: for,
what we ascribe unto fire, they impute unto cold, and imagine that soules
are both purged and punished by the vigor of an extreame coldnesse.
This example putteth me in mind of another pleasant diversity: For,
as there were some people found who tooke pleasure to unhood the end of
their yard, and to cut off the fore-skinne after the manner of the Mahometans
and Jewes, some there were found that made so great a conscience to unhood
it, that with little strings they caried their fore-skin very carefully
out-streched and fastened above, for feare that end should see the aire.
And of this other diversity also, that as we honour our Kings and celebrate
our Holy-daies with decking and trimming our selves with the best habilliments
we have; in some regions there, to shew all disparity and submission to
their King, their subjects present themselves unto him in their basest
and meanest apparrell; and entring unto his pallace they take some old
torne garment and put it over their other attire, to the end all the glory
and ornament may shine in their Soveraigne and Maister.
<p>But let us goe on: if Nature enclose within
the limits of her ordinary progresse, as all other things, so the beliefes,
the judgments and the opinions of men; if they have their revolutions,
their seasons, their birth, and their death, even as cabbages: if heaven
doth move, agitate and rowle them at his pleasure, what powerfull and permanent
authority doe we ascribe unto them? If by uncontroled experience
we palpably touch, that the forme of our being depends of the aire, of
the climate, and of the soile wherein we are borne and not onely the hew,
the stature, the complexion and the countenance, but also the soules facilities:
Et plagae coeli non serum ad robor corporum, sed etiam animorum facit:
'The climate helpeth not onely for strength of body, but of minds,' saith
Vegetius: And that the Goddesse, foundresse of the Citie of Athens, chose
a temperature of a country to situate it in, that might make the men wise,
as the AEgyptian Priests taught Solon: <i>Athenis tenue eoclum: ex quo
etiam acutiores putantur Attici: crassum Thebis: itague pingues Thebani,
et valentes</i>:/1 'About Athens is a thin aire, whereby those Country-men
are esteemed the sharper witted: about Thebes the aire is grosse, and therefore
the Thebans were grosse and strong of constitution.' In such manner
that as fruits and beasts doe spring up diverse and different; so men are
borne either more or lesse warlike, martiall, just, temperate, and docile:
here subject to wine, there to theft and whoredome: here inclined to superstition,
addicted to misbehaving; here given to liberty; there to servitude; capable
of some one art or science; grosse-witted or ingenious: either obedient
or rebellious; good or bad, according as the inclination of the place beareth,
where they are seated; and being removed from one soile to another (as
plants are) they take a new complexion: which was the cause that Cirus
would never permit the Persians to leave their barren, rough, and craggie

What assurance have we that at any time she leaveth her mistaking, and
that she continueth not even at this day, in her error? Me thinkes amongst
other testimonies of our imbecilities, this one ought not to be forgotten,
that by wishing it selfe, man cannot yet finde out what he wanteth; that
not by enjoying or possession, but by imagination and full wishing, we
cannot all agree in one that we most stand in need of, and would best content
us. Let our imagination have free liberty to cut out and sew at her
pleasure, she cannot so much as desire what is fittest to please and content
her.

<p>generally for every man to obey the lawes of his country, as is the
advise of Socrates, inspired (saith be) by a divine perswasion. And
what else meaneth she thereby, but only that our devoire or duety hath
no other rule but casuall? Truth ought to have a like and universall
visage throughout the world. Law and justice, if man knew any, that
had a body and true essence, he would not fasten it to the condition of
this or that countries customes. It is not according to the Persians or
Indians fantazie that vertue should take her forme. Nothing is more
subject unto a continuall agitation then the laws. I have, since
I was borne, seene those of our neighbours, the English- men, changed and
re-changed three or foure times, not only in politike subjects, which is
that some will dispense of constancy, but in the most important subject
that possibly can be, that is to say, in religion: whereof I am so much
the more ashamed, because it is a nation with which my countriemen have
heretofore had so inward and familiar acquaintance, that even to this day
there remain in my house some ancient monuments of our former alliance.
Nay, I have seene amongst our selves some things become lawfull which erst
were deemed capitall: and we that hold some others, are likewise in possibilitie,
according to the uncertainty of warring<a NAME="fortune4"></a><b><a href="#fortune5">
fortune+</a></b>, one day or other, to be offenders against the Majestie
both of God and man, if our justice chance to fall under the mercy of justice;
and in the space of few yeares possession, taking a contrary essence.
How could that ancient God more evidently accuse, in humane knowledge,
the ignorance of divine essence, and teach men that their religion was
but a peece of their owne invention, fit to combine their societies then
in declaring, as he did, to those which sought the instruction of it, by
his sacred Tripos, that the true worshipping of God was that which he found
to be observed by the custome of the place where he lived? Oh God,
what bond or dutie is it that we owe not to our Soveragne Creators benignitie,
in that he hath beene pleased to cleare and enfranchise our beliefe from
those vagabonding and arbitrary devotions, and fixt it upon the eternall
base of his holy word? What will Philosophie then say to us in this
necessity? that we follow the lawes of our country, that is to say, this
waveing sea of a peoples or of a Princes opinions, which shall paint me
forth justice with as many c6oours, and reforme the same into as many visages
as there are changes and alterations of passions in them. I cannot
have my judgement so flexible. What goodnesse is that which but yesterday
I saw in credit and esteeme, and to morrow to have lost all reputation,
and that the crossing of a river is made a crime? What truth is that
which these Mountaines bound, and is a lie in the world beyond them?
But they are pleasant, when to allow the lawes some certaintie, they say
that there be some firme, perpetuall and immoveable; which they call naturall,
and by the condition of their proper essence, are imprinted in mankind:
of which some make three in number, some foure, some more, some lesse:
an evident token that it is a marke as doubtfull as the rest. Now
are they so unfortunate (for how can I terme that but misfortune, that
of so infinit a number of lawes there is not so much as one to be found
which the fortune or temeritie of chance hath graunted to be universally
received, and by the consent of unanimitie of all Nations to be admitted?)
they are (I say) so miserable that of these three or four choice-selected
lawes there is not one alone that is not impugned or disallowed, not by
one nation, but by many. Now is the generalitie of approbation the
onely likely ensigne by which they may argue some lawes to be naturall;
for what nature had indeed ordained us, that should we doubtlesse follow
with one common consent; and not one onely nation, but every man in particular
should have a feeling of the force and violece which he should urge him
with, that would incite him to contrarie and resist that law. Let
them all (for example sake) shew me but one of this condition. Protagoras
and Ariston gave the justice of the lawes no other essence, but the authority
and opinion of the law giver, and that excepted, both good

<p>and honest lost their qualities, and remained but vaine and idle names
of indifferent things. Thrasymachus, in Plato, thinkes there is no
other right but the commoditie of the superior. There is nothing
wherein the world differeth so much as in customes and lawes. Some
things are here accompted abominable, which in another place are esteemed
commendable; as in Lacedemonia, the slight and subtlety in stealing marriages
in proximity of blood are amongst us forbidden as capitall, elsewhere they
are allowed and esteemed

The murthering of children and of parents; the communication with women;
traffic of jobbing and stealing; free licence to all manner of sensuality;
to conclude, there is nothing so extreme and horrible, but is found to
be received and allowed by the custome of some nation. It is credible
that there be naturall lawes, as may be seene in other creatures, but in
us they are lost: this goodly humane reason engrafting it self among all
men, to sway and command, confounding and topsi-turving the visage of all
things according to her inconstant vanitie and vaine inconstancy.
Nihil itaque amplius nostrum est, quod nostrum dico, artis est: 'Therefore
nothing more is ours: all that I call ours belongs to art. Subjects
have divers lustres, and severall considerations, whence the diversity
of opinion is chiefly engendred. One nation vieweth a subject with
one visage, and thereon it staies; an other with an other. Nothing
can be imagined so horrible as for one to eate and devour his owne father.
Those people which anciently kept this custome hold it neverthelesse for

that meane to give their fathers the worthiest and most honourable sepulchre,
harboring their fathers bodies and reliques in themselves, and in their
marrow; in some sort reviving and regenerating them by the transmutation
made in their quicke flesh by digestion and nourishment. It is easie
to be considered what abomination and cruelty it had beene, in men accustomed
and trained in this inhumane superstition, to cast the carcases of their
parents into the corruption of the earth, as food for beasts and wormes.
Lycurgus wisely considereth in theft, the vivacitie, dilignce, courage,
and nimblenesse that is required in surprising or taking any thing from
ones neighbour, and the commoditie which thereby redoundeth to the common-
wealth, that every man heedeth more curiously the keeping of that which
is his owne, and judged that by this twofold institution to assaile and
to defend, much good was drawne for military discipline (which was the
principall Science and chiefe verue wherein he would enable that nation)
of greater respect and more consideration than was the disorder and injustice
of prevailing and taking other mens goods. Dionysius, the tyrant
offered Plato a robe made after the Persian fashion, long, damask, and
perfumed: but he refused the same, saying, 'That being borne a man, he
would not willingly put on a womans garment. But Aristippus tooke
it, with this answer, 'That no garment could corrupt a chaste mind.
His friends reproved his demissenesse in being so little offended, that
Dionysius had spitten in his face. 'Tut (said be) fishers suffer themselves
to be washed over head and eares to get a gudgion. Diogenes washing
of coleworts for his dinner, seeing him passe by, said unto him, 'If thou
couldest live with coleworts, thou wouldest not court and fawne upon a
tyrant;' to whom Aristippus replied, 'If thou couldest live among men,
thou wouldest not wash coleworts. See here how reason yeeldeth apparance
to divers effects. It is a pitcher with two eares, which a man may
take hold on, either by the right or left hand.

 I have heard it reported of a Judge who, when
he met with any sharp conflict betweene Bartolus and Baldus, or with any
case admitting contrarieties was wont to write in the margin of his book,
'A question for a friend,' which is to say, that the truth was so entangled
and disputable that in such a case he might

favour which party he should thinke good. There was no want but
of spirit and sufficiency, if he set not every where through his books,
'A question for a friend. The Advocates and Judges of our time find
in all cases byases too-too-many to fit them where they think good.
To so infinite a science, depending on the authority of so many opinions,
and of so arbitrary a subject, it cannot be but that an exceeding confusion
of judgements must arise. There are very few processes so cleare but the
Lawiers advises upon them will be found to differ: What one company
hath judged another will adjudge the contrary, and the very same will another
time change opinion. Whereof we see ordinarie examples by this licence
which wonderfully blemisheth the authoritie and lustre of our law, never
to stay upon one sentence, but to run from one to another judge, to decide
one same case. Touching the libertie of Philosophicall opinions concerning
vice and vertue, it is a thing needing no great extension, and wherein
are found many advises which were better unspoken then published to weake
capacities. Arcesilaus was wont to say that in pailliardize it was
not worthy consideration, where, on what side, and how it was done.
Et obcaenas voluptates, si natura requirit, non genera, aut loco, aut ordine,

aetatem iuvenes amandi sint: 'Obscene pleasures, if nature require them,
the Epicure esteemeth not to be measured by kind, place, or order: but
by forme, age, and fashion. Nor doth he thinke that holy loves should
be strange from a wise man. Let us then question to what years yong
folke may be beloved. These two last Stoicke places, and upon this
purpose, the reproch of Diogarchus to Plato himselfe, shew how many excessive
licences and out of common use soundest Philosophy doth tolerate.

<p>our rivers: follow them upward into their source, and you shall find
them but a bubble of water, scarce to be discerned, which in gliding on
swelleth so proud and gathers so much strength. Behold the ancient
considerations which have given the first motion to this famous torrent,
so full of dignitie, of honour and reverence, you shall finde them so light
and weake that these men which will weigh all and complaine of reason,
and who receive nothing upon trust and authoritie, it is no wonder if their
judgments are often far distant from common judgement. Men that take
Natures first image for a patterne it is no marvaile if in most of their
opinions they miss the common- beaten path. As for example few amongst
them would have approved the false conditions of our marriages, and most
of them would have had women in community and without any private respect.
They refused our ceremonies: Chrysippus said that some Philosophers would
in open view of all men shew a dozen of tumbling-tricks, yea, without any
slops or breeches, for a dozen of olives. He would hardly have perswaded
Calisthenes to refuse his faire daughter Agarista to Hippoclides, because
he had seen him graft the forked tree in her upon a table. Metrocles
somewhat indiscreetly, as he was disputing in his Schole, in presence of
his auditory, let a fart, for shame whereof he afterwards kept his house
and could not be drawen abroad untill such time as Crates went to visit
him, who to his perswasions and reasons, adding the example of his liberty,
began to fart a vie with him and to remove this scruple from off his conscience;
and moreover won him to his Stoicall (the more free) Sect, from the Peripateticall
(and more civill) one, which the-therunto he had followed. That which
we call civilitie not to dare to doe that openly, which amongst us is both
awfull and honest, being done in secret, they termed folly: And to
play the wilie Foxe in concealing and disclaiming what nature, custome,
and our desire publish and proclaims of our actions, they deemed to be
a vice. And thought it a suppressing
of Venus her mysteries to remove them from out the private vestry of
her temple, and expose them to the open view of the people. And that
to draw her sports from out the curtaines was to loose them. Shame
is matter of some consequence. Concealing, reservation and circumspection
are parts of estimation. That sensuality under the maske of Vertu
did very ingeniously procure not to be prostituted in the midst of highwaies,
not trodden upon and seen by the common sort, alledging the dignity and
commodity of her wonted Cabinets. Whereupon some say that to forbid
and remove the common brothel-houses is not only to spread whoredome every
where, which only was allotted to those places, but also to incite idle
and vagabond men to that vice by reason of the difficultie.

<blockquote>A Philosopher being taken with the deed, was demaunded what

Author holds this action so necessarily-bound to secrecy and shame, that
in Cynike embracements and dalliances he coulidnot be perswaded that the
worke should come to her end; but rather that it lingred and staid only
to represent wanton gestures and lascivious motions, to maintaine the impudency
of their schooles profession: and that to powre forth what shame had forced

He had not seene far enough into their licenciousnesse: for Diogenes in
sight of all, exercising his Masturbation, bred a longing desire in the
bystanders, that in such sort they might fill their bellies by rubbing
or clawing the same. To those that asked him why he sought for no
fitter place to feed in than in the open frequented highway he made answer,
'It is because I am hungry in the open frequented high-way. The Philosophers
Women, which medled with their Sects, did likewise in all places and without
any discretion medle with their bodies: And Crates had never received
Hipparchia into his fellowship but upon condition io follow all the customes
and fashions of his order. These Philosophers set an extreme rate
on vertue and rejected al other disciplins except the mortall; hence it
is that in all actions they ascribed the Soveraigne authority to the election
of their wise, yea, and above all lawes: and appointed no other restraint
unto voluptuousness, but the moderation and preservation of others liberty.
Heraclitus and Protagoras, forsomuch as wine seemeth bitter unto the sicke
and pleasing to the healthy; and an oare crooked in the water and straight
to them that see it above water, and such-like contrary apparances which
are found in some subjects; argued that all subjects had the causes of
these apparances in them, and that there was some kind of bitternes in
the wine which had a reference unto the sick mans taste; in the oare a
certain crooked qualitie, having relation to him that seeth it in the water.
And so of all things else. Which implieth, that all is in all things, and
by consequence nothing in any: for either nothing is, or all is.
This opinion put me in mind of the experience we have, that there is not
any one sense or visage, either straight or crooked, bitter or sweet, but
mans wit shall find in the writings which he undertaketh to runne over.
In the purest, most unspotted, and most absolutely perfect word that possibly
can be, how many errors, falshoods and lies
have beene made to proceed from it? What heresie hath not found
testimonies and ground sufficient, both to undertake and to maintaine itself?
It is, therefore, that the Authors of such errors will never goe from this
proofe of the testimony of words interpretation. A man of worth going
about by authority to approve the search of the Philosophers stone (wherein
he was overwhelmed) alleadged at least five or six several passages out
of the holy bible unto me, upon which (he said) he had at first gounded
himselfe for the discharge of his conscience (for he is a man of Ecclesiastical
profession), and truly the invention of them was not only pleasant, but
also very fitly applied to the defence of this goodly and mind-enchanting
science. This way is the credit of divining fables attained to.
There is no prognosticator if he have but this authority that any one wil
but vouchsafe to read him over, and curiously to search all the infoldings
and lustres of his words, but a man shall make him say what he pleaseth,
as the Sibils. There are so many means of interpretation that it is hard,
be it flat-long, side-long, or edge-long, but an ingenious and pregnant
wit shal in all subjects meet with some aire that wil fit his turn.
Therefore is a clowdy, darke and ambiguous stile found in so frequent and
ancient custome, that the Author may gaine to draw, allure, and busie posterity
to himselfe, which not only the sufficiency but the casuall favour of the
matter may gaine as much or more. As for other matters let him, be
it either through foolishnes or subtilty, shew himself somewhat obscure
and divers, it is no matter, care not he for that. A number of spirits
sifting and tossing him over will finde and express sundry formes, either
accordinfg, or collaterally, or contrary to his owne, all which shall do
him credit. He shal see himselfe enriched by the meanes of his Disciples,
as the Grammer Schools Maisters. It is that which hath made many things
of nothing, to pass very currant, that hath brought divers books in credit,
and charged with all sorts of matter that any hath but desired: one selfsame

<p>a thousand and a thousand, and as many severall images and divers considerations,
as it best pleaseth us. Is it possible that ever Homer meant all
that which some make him to have meant? And that he prostrated hiniselfe
to so many, and so severall shapes, as, Divines, Lawiers, Captaines, Philosophers,
and all sort of people else, which, how diversely and contrary soever it
be they treat of sciences, do notwithstanding wholy rely, upon him, and
refer themselves unto him as a Generall Maister for all offices, workes,
sciences, and tradesmen, and an universall counsellor in all enterprises;
whosoever hath had need of Oracles or Predictions, and would apply them
to himselfe, hath found them in him for his purpose. A notable man,
and a good friend of mine, would make one marvel to beare what strange
far-fetcht conceits and admirable affinities, in favor of our religion,
he maketh to derive from him; and can hardly be drawne from this opinion,
but that such was Homers intent and meaning (yet is Homer so familiar unto
him, as I thinke no man of our age is better acquainted with him).
And what he finds in favour of our religion, many ancient learned men have
found in favour of theirs. See how Plato is tossed and turned over,
every man endevoring to apply him to his purpose, giveth him what construction
he list. He is wrested and inserted to all newfangled opinions that
the world receiveth or alloweth of, and according to the different course
of subjects is made to be repugnant unto himselfe. Every one according
to his sense makes him to disavow the customes that were lawfull in his
daies, inasmuch as they are unlawfull in these times. All which is
very lively and strongly maintained, according as the wit and learning
of the interpreter is strong and quicke. Upon the ground which Heraclitus
had, and that sentence of his, that all things had those shapes in them
which men found in them. And Democritus out of the very same drew a cleane
contrarie conclusion, id est, that subjects had nothing at all in them
of that which we found in them. And forasmuch as honny was sweet
to one man and bitter to another,
he argued that honny was neither sweet nor bitter. The Pyrrhonians
would say they know not whether it be sweet or bitter, or both or neither:
for, they ever gain the highest point of doubting. The Cyrenaicks
held that nothing was perceptible outwardly, and only that was perceivable
which by the inward touch or feeling touched or concerned us, as griefe
and sensuality, distinguishing neither tune nor collours, but onely certaine
affections that came to us of them; and that man had no other seate of
his judgment. Protagoras deemed that to be true to all men, which to all
men seemeth so. The Epicurians place all judgment in the senses, 
and in the notice of things, and in voluptuousnesse. Platoes mind
was, that the judgment of truth, and truth it selfe drawne from opinions
and senses, belonged to the spirit and to cogitation.

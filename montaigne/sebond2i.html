<h1>Apology for Raymond Sebond</h1>
<h2>by Michel de Montaigne (1588)</h2>
<h2>translated by Charles Cotton (circa 1686)</h2>
<h3>Part IX: That the Senses Are Inadequate</h3>
<p>This discourse has put me upon the consideration of the senses, in which lies the greatest foundation and Prof of our ignorance. Whatsoever is known, is doubtless known by the faculty of the knower; for, seeing the judgment proceeds from the operation of him that judges, 'tis reason that this operation be performed by his means and will, not by the constraint of another; as it would happen if we knew things by the power, and according to the law of their essence. Now all knowledge is conveyed to us by the senses; they are our masters:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  Via qua munita fidei<br/>
  Proxima fert humanum in pectus, templaque mentis;
  <br/><br/>
  It is the surest path that faith can find<br/>
  By which to enter human heart and mind.
 </blockquote>
<p>Science begins by them, and is resolved into them. After all, we should know no more than a stone if we did not know there is sound, odour, light, taste, measure, weight, softness, hardness, sharpness, colour, smoothness, breadth, and depth; these are the platforms and principles of the structure of all our knowledge; and, according to some, science is nothing else but sense. He that could make me contradict the senses, would have me by the throat; he could not make me go further back. The senses are the beginning and the end of human knowledge:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  Invenies primis ab sensibns esse creatam<br/>
  Notitiam veil; neque sensus posse refelli....<br/>
  Quid majore fide porro, quam sensus, haberi Debet?
  <br/><br/>
  Of truth, whate'er discoveries are made,<br/>
  Are by the senses to us first conveyed;<br/>
  Nor will one sense be baffled; for on what<br/>
  Can we rely more safely than on that?
 </blockquote>
<p>Let us attribute to them the least we can, we must, however, of necessity grant them this, that it is by their means and mediation that all our instruction is directed. Cicero says, that Chrysippus having attempted to extenuate the force and virtue of the senses, presented to himself arguments and so vehement oppositions to the contrary that he could not satisfy himself therein; whereupon Cameades, who maintained the contrary side, boasted that he would make use of the very words and arguments of Chrysippus to controvert and confute him, and therefore thus cried out against him: 'O miserable! thy force has destroyed thee.' There can be nothing absurd to a greater degree than to maintain that fire does not warm, that light does not shine, and that there is no weight nor solidity in iron, which are things conveyed to us by the senses; neither is there belief nor knowledge in man that can be compared to that for certainty.</p>
<p>The first consideration I have upon the subject of the senses is that I make a doubt whether or no man be furnished with all natural senses. I see several animals who live an entire and perfect life, some without sight, others without hearing; who knows whether to us also one, two, three, or many other senses may not be wanting? For if any one be wanting, our examination cannot discover the defect. 'Tis the privilege of the senses to be the utmost limit of our discovery; there is nothing beyond them that can assist us in exploration, not so much as one sense in the discovery of another:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  An poterunt oculos aures reprehendere? an aures<br/>
  Tactus an hunc porro tactum sapor argnet oris?<br/>
  An confutabunt nares, oculive revincent?
  <br/><br/>
  Can ears the eyes, the touch the ears, correct?<br/>
  Or is that touch by tasting to be check'd?<br/>
  Or th' other senses, shall the nose or eyes<br/>
  Confute in their peculiar faculties?
 </blockquote>
<p>They all make the extremest limits of our ability:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  Seorsum cuique potestas Divisa est, sua vis cuique est,
  <br/><br/>
  Each has its power distinctly and alone,<br/>
  And every sense's power is its own.
 </blockquote>
<p>It is impossible to make a man naturally blind conceive that he does not see; impossible to make him desire sight, or to regret his defect; for which reason we ought not to derive any assurance from the soul's being contented and satisfied with those we have; considering that it cannot be sensible herein of its infirmity and imperfection, if there be any such thing. It is impossible to say any thing to this blind man, either by reasoning, argument, or similitude, that can possess his imagination with any apprehension of light, colour, or sight; there's nothing remains behind that can push on the senses to evidence. Those that are born blind, whom we hear wish they could see, it is not that they understand what they desire; they have learned from us that they want something; that there is something to be desired that we have, which they can name indeed and speak of its effect and consequences; but yet they know not what it is, nor apprehend it at all.</p>
<p>I have seen a gentleman of a good family who was born blind, or at least blind from such an age that he knows not what sight is; who is so little sensible of his defect that he makes use as we do of words proper for seeing, and applies them after a manner wholly particular and his own.  They brought him a child to which he was god-father, which, having taken into his arms, 'Good God,' said he, 'what a fine child!  How beautiful to look upon! what a pretty face it has!' He will say, like one of us, 'This room has a very fine prospect;&mdash;it is clear weather;&mdash;the sun shines bright.' And moreover, being that hunting, tennis, and butts are our exercises, and he has heard so, he has taken a liking to them, will ride a-hunting, and believes he has as good share of the sport as we have; and will express himself as angry or pleased as the best of us all, and yet knows nothing of it but by the ear.  One cries out to him, 'Here's a hare!' when he is upon some even plain where he may safely ride; and afterwards, when they tell him, 'The hare is killed,' he will be as overjoyed and proud of it as he hears others say they are. He will take a tennis-ball in his left hand and strike it away with the racket; he will shoot with a harquebuss at random, and is contented with what his people tell him, that he is over, or wide.</p>
<p>Who knows whether all human kind commit not the like absurdity, for want of some sense, and that through this default the greatest part of the face of things is concealed from us? What do we know but that the difficulties which we find in several works of nature proceed hence; and that several effects of animals, which exceed our capacity, are not produced by faculty of some sense that we are defective in? and whether some of them have not by this means a life more full and entire than ours? We seize an apple with all our senses; we there find redness, smoothness, odour, and sweetness; but it may have other virtues besides these, as to heat or binding, which no sense of ours can have any reference unto. Is it not likely that there are sensitive faculties in nature that are fit to judge of and to discern those which we call the occult properties in several things, as for the loadstone to attract iron; and that the want of such faculties is the cause that we are ignorant of the true essence of such things? 'Tis perhaps some particular sense that gives cocks to understand what hour it is at midnight, and when it grows to be towards day, and that makes them crow accordingly; that teaches chickens, before they have any experience of the matter, to fear a sparrow-hawk, and not a goose or a peacock, though birds of a much larger size; that cautions them against the hostile quality the cat has against them, and makes them not to fear a dog; to arm themselves against the mewing, a kind of flattering voice, of the one, and not against the barking, a shrill and threatening voice, of the other; that teaches wasps, ants, and rats, to fall upon the best pear and the best cheese before they have tasted them, and inspires the stag, elephant, and serpent, with the knowledge of a certain herb proper for their cure. There is no sense that has not a mighty dominion, and that does not by its power introduce an infinite number of knowledges.  If we were defective in the intelligence of sounds, of harmony, and of the voice, it would cause an unimaginable confusion in all the rest of our science; for, besides what belongs to the proper effect of every sense, how many arguments, consequences, and conclusions do we draw to other things, by comparing one sense with another? Let an understanding man imagine human nature originally produced without the sense of seeing, and consider what ignorance and trouble such a defect would bring upon him, what a darkness and blindness in the soul; he will then see by that of how great importance to the knowledge of truth the privation of such another sense, or of two or three, should we be so deprived, would be. We have formed a truth by the consultation and concurrence of our five senses; but perhaps we should have the consent and contribution of eight or ten to make a certain discovery of it in its essence.</p>
<p>The sects that controvert the knowledge of man do it principally by the uncertainty and weakness of our senses; for since all knowledge is by their means and mediation conveyed unto us, if they fail in their report, if they corrupt or alter what they bring us from without, if the light which by them creeps into the soul be obscured in the passage, we have nothing else to hold by. From this extreme difficulty all these fancies proceed: 'That every subject has in itself all we there find. That it has nothing in it of what we think we there find;' and that of the Epicureans, 'That the sun is no bigger than 'tis judged by our sight to be:&mdash;'</p>
<blockquote>
  Quidquid id est, nihilo fertur majore figura,<br/>
  Quam nostris oculis quam cemimus, esse videtur:
  <br/><br/>
  But be it what it will in our esteems,<br/>
  It is no bigger than to us it seems:
 </blockquote>
<p>that the appearances which represent a body great to him that is near, and less to him that is more remote, are both true:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  Nee tamen hic oculos falli concedimus hilum....<br/>
  Proinde animi vitium hoc oculis adfingere noli:
  <br/><br/>
  Yet that the eye's deluded we deny;<br/>
  Charge not the mind's faults, therefore, on the eye:
 </blockquote>
<p>'and, resolutely, that there is no deceit in the senses; that we are to lie at their mercy, and seek elsewhere reasons to excuse the difference and contradictions we there find, even to the inventing of lies and other flams, if it come to that, rather than accuse the senses.' Timagoras vowed that, by pressing or turning his eye, he could never perceive the light of the candle to double, and that the seeming so proceeded from the vice of opinion, and not from the instrument. The most absurd of all absurdities, with the Epicureans, is to deny the force and effect of the senses:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  Proinde, quod in quoquo est his visum tempore, verum est<br/>
  Et, si non potuit ratio dissolvere causam,<br/>
  Cur ea, qu fuerint juxtim quadrata, procul sint<br/>
  Visa rotunda; tamen prstat rationis egentem<br/>
  Beddere mendose causas utriusque figur,<br/>
  Quam manibus manifesta suis emittere ququam,<br/>
  Et violare fidem primam, et convellere tota<br/>
  Fundamenta, quibus nixatur vita salusque:<br/>
  Non modo enim ratio ruat omnis, vita quoque ipsa<br/>
  Concidat extemplo, nisi credere sensibus ausis,<br/>
  Procipitesque locos vitare, et ctera, qu sint<br/>
  In genere hoc fugienda.
  <br/><br/>
  That what we see exists I will maintain,<br/>
  And if our feeble reason can't explain<br/>
  Why things seem square when they are very near,<br/>
  And at a greater distance round appear;<br/>
  Tis better yet, for him that's at a pause,<br/>
  T' assign to either figure a false cause,<br/>
  Than shock his faith, and the foundations rend<br/>
  On which our safety and our life depend:<br/>
  For reason not alone, but life and all,<br/>
  Together will with sudden ruin fall;<br/>
  Unless we trust our senses, nor despise<br/>
  To shun the various dangers that arise.
 </blockquote>
<p>This so desperate and unphilosophical advice expresses only this,&mdash;that human knowledge cannot support itself but by reason unreasonable, foolish, and mad; but that it is yet better that man, to set a greater value upon himself, make use of any other remedy, how fantastic soever, than to confess his necessary ignorance&mdash;a truth so disadvantageous to him.  He cannot avoid owning that the senses are the sovereign lords of his knowledge; but they are uncertain, and falsifiable in all circumstances; 'tis there that he is to fight it out to the last; and if his just forces fail him, as they do, to supply that defect with obstinacy, temerity, and impudence. In case what the Epicureans say be true, viz: 'that we have no knowledge if the senses' appearances be false;' and if that also be true which the Stoics say, 'that the appearances of the senses are so false that they can furnish us with no manner of knowledge,' we shall conclude, to the disadvantage of these two great dogmatical sects, that there is no science at all.</p>
<p>As to the error and uncertainty of the operation of the senses, every one may furnish himself with as many examples as he pleases; so ordinary are the faults and tricks they put upon us. In the echo of a valley the sound of a trumpet seems to meet us, which comes from a place behind:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  Exstantesque procul medio de gurgite montes,<br/>
  Classibus inter qnos liber patet exitus, idem<br/>
  Apparent, et longe divolsi licet, ingens<br/>
  Insula conjunctis tamen ex his ana videtur...<br/>
  Et fugere ad puppim colies campique videntur,<br/>
  Qnos agimns proter navim, velisque volamus....<br/>
  Ubi in medio nobis equus acer obhsit<br/>
  Flamine, equi corpus transversum ferre videtur<br/>
  Vis, et in adversum flumen contrudere raptim.
  <br/><br/>
  And rocks i' th' seas that proudly raise their head,<br/>
  Though far disjoined, though royal navies spread,<br/>
  Their sails between; yet if from distance shown,<br/>
  They seem an island all combin'd in one.<br/>
  Thus ships, though driven by a prosperous gale,<br/>
  Seem fix'd to sailors; those seem under sail<br/>
  That ride at anchor safe; and all admire,<br/>
  As they row by, to see the rocks retire.<br/>
  Thus, when in rapid streams my horse hath stood,<br/>
  And I look'd downward on the rolling flood;<br/>
  Though he stood still, I thought he did divide<br/>
  The headlong streams, and strive against the tide,<br/>
  And all things seem'd to move on every side.
 </blockquote>
<p>Take a musket-ball under the forefinger, the middle finger being lapped over it, it feels so like two that a man will have much ado to persuade himself there is but one; the end of the two fingers feeling each of them one at the same time; for that the senses are very often masters of our reason, and constrain it to receive impressions which it judges and knows to be false, is frequently seen. I set aside the sense of feeling, that has its functions nearer, more lively, and substantial, that so often, by the effects of the pains it helps the body to, subverts and overthrows all those fine Stoical resolutions, and compels him to cry out of his belly, who has resolutely established this doctrine in his soul&mdash;'That the colic, and all other pains and diseases, are indifferent things, not having the power to abate any thing of the sovereign felicity wherein the wise man is seated by his virtue.' There is no heart so effeminate that the rattle and sound of our drums and trumpets will not inflame with courage; nor so sullen that the harmony of our music will not rouse and cheer; nor so stubborn a soul that will not feel itself struck with some reverence in considering the gloomy vastness of our churches, the variety of ornaments, and order of our ceremonies; and in hearing the solemn music of our organs, and the grace and devout harmony of our voices. Even those that come in with contempt feel a certain shivering in their hearts, and something of dread that makes them begin to doubt their opinions. For my part I do not think myself strong enough to hear an ode of Horace or Catullus sung by a beautiful young mouth without emotion; and Zeno had reason to say 'that the voice was the flower of beauty.' One would once make me believe that a certain person, whom all we Frenchmen know, had imposed upon me in repeating some verses that he had made; that they were not the same upon paper that they were in the air; and that my eyes would make a contrary judgment to my ears; so great a power has pronunciation to give fashion and value to works that are left to the efficacy and modulation of the voice. And therefore Philoxenus was not so much to blame, hearing one giving an ill accent to some composition of his, in spurning and breaking certain earthen vessels of his, saying, 'I break what is thine, because thou corruptest what is mine.' To what end did those men who have, with a firm resolution, destroyed themselves, turn away their faces that they might not see the blow that was by themselves appointed? And that those who, for their health, desire and command incisions to be made, and cauteries to be applied to them, cannot endure the sight of the preparations, instruments, and operations of the surgeon, being that the sight is not in any way to participate in the pain? Are not these proper examples to verify the authority the senses have over the imagination? 'Tis to much purpose that we know these tresses were borrowed from a page or a lackey; that this rouge came from Spain, and this pearl-powder from the Ocean Sea. Our sight will, nevertheless, compel us to confess their subject more agreeable and more lovely against all reason; for in this there is nothing of its own:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  Auferinrar cultu; gemmis, auroque teguntur<br/>
  Crimina; pars minima est ipsa puella sni.<br/>
  Spe, ubi sit quod ames, inter tarn multa requiras:<br/>
  Decipit hac oculos gide dives Amor.
  <br/><br/>
  By dress we're won; gold, gems, and rich brocades<br/>
  Make up the pageant that your heart invades;<br/>
  In all that glittering figure which you see,<br/>
  The far least part of her own self is she;<br/>
  In vain for her you love amidst such cost<br/>
  You search, the mistress in such dress is lost.
 </blockquote>
<p>What a strange power do the poets attribute to the senses, that make Narcissus so desperately in love with his own shadow,</p>
<blockquote>
  Cunctaque miratur, quibus est mirabilis ipse;<br/>
  Se cupit imprudens, et, qui probat, ipse probatur;<br/>
  Dumque petit, petitur; pariterque accendit, et ardet:
  <br/><br/>
  Admireth all; for which to be admired;<br/>
  And inconsiderately himself desir'd.<br/>
  The praises which he gives his beauty claim'd,<br/>
  Who seeks is sought, th' inflamer is inflam'd:
 </blockquote>
<p>and Pygmalion's judgment so troubled by the impression of the sight of his ivory statue that he loves and adores it as if it were a living woman!</p>
<blockquote>
  Oscnla dat, reddique putat: sequi turque, tenetque,<br/>
  Et credit tactis digitos insidere membris;<br/>
  Et metuit, pressos veniat ne livor in artus.
  <br/><br/>
  He kisses, and believes he's kissed again;<br/>
  Seizes, and 'twixt his arms his love doth strain,<br/>
  And thinks the polish'd ivory thus held<br/>
  Doth to his fingers amorous pressure yield,<br/>
  And has a timorous fear, lest black and blue<br/>
  Should in the parts with ardour press'd ensue.
 </blockquote>
<p>Put a philosopher into a cage of small thin set bars of iron, hang him on the top of the high tower of Notre Dame at Paris; he will see, by manifest reason, that he cannot possibly fall, and yet he will find (unless he has been used to the plumber's trade) that he cannot help but the sight of the excessive height will fright and astound him; for we have enough to do to assure ourselves in the galleries of our steeples, if they are made with open work, although they are of stone; and some there are that cannot endure so much as to think of it. Let there be a beam thrown over betwixt these two towers, of breadth sufficient to walk upon, there is no philosophical wisdom so firm that can give us the courage to walk over it as we should do upon the ground. I have often tried this upon our mountains in these parts; and though I am one who am not the most subject to be afraid, I was not able to endure to look into that infinite depth without horror and trembling, though I stood above my length from the edge of the precipice, and could not have fallen unless I would. Where I also observed that, what height soever the precipice was, provided there were some tree, or some jutting out of a rock, a little to support and divide the sight, it a little eases our fears, and gives greater assurance; as if they were things by which in falling we might have some relief; but that direct precipices we are not to look upon without being giddy; <em>Ut despici vine vertigine timid ocvlorum animique non possit:</em> ''To that one cannot look without dizziness;' which is a manifest imposture of the sight. And therefore it was that that fine philosopher put out his own eyes, to free the soul from being diverted by them, and that he might philosophize at greater liberty; but, by the same rule, he should have dammed up his ears, that Theophrastus says are the most dangerous instruments about us for receiving violent impressions to alter and disturb us; and, finally, should have deprived himself of all his other senses, that is to say, of his life and being; for they have all the power to command our soul and reason: <em>Fit etiam sope specie qudam, sope vocum gravitate et cantibus, ut pettantur animi vehementius; sope etiam cura et timor,</em> 'For it often falls out that the minds are more vehemently struck by some sight, by the quality and sound of the voice, or by singing; and ofttimes also by grief and fear.' Physicians hold that there are certain complexions that are agitated by the same sounds and instruments even to fury. I have seen some who could not hear a bone gnawed under the table without impatience; and there is scarce any man who is not disturbed at the sharp and shrill noise that the file makes in grating upon the iron; as also to hear chewing near them, or to hear any one speak who has an impediment in the throat or nose, will move some people even to anger and hatred. Of what use was that piping prompter of Gracchus, who softened, raised, and moved his master's voice whilst he declaimed at Rome, if the movements and quality of the sound had not the power to move and alter the judgments of the auditory? In earnest, there is wonderful reason to keep such a clutter about the firmness of this fine piece, that suffers itself to be turned and twined by the motion and accidents of so light a wind.</p>
<p>The same cheat that the senses put upon our understanding they have in turn put upon them; the soul also some times has its revenge; they lie and contend which should most deceive one another. What we see and hear when we are transported with passion, we neither see nor hear as it is:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  Et solem geminum, et duplices se ostendere Thebas.
  <br/><br/>
  Thebes seems two cities, and the sun two suns.
 </blockquote>
<p>The object that we love appears to us more beautiful than it really is;</p>
<blockquote>
  Multimodis igitur pravas turpesque videmus<br/>
  Esse in deliciis, summoque in honore vigere;
  <br/><br/>
  Hence 'tis that ugly things in fancied dress<br/>
  Seem gay, look fair to lovers' eyes, and please;
 </blockquote>
<p>and that we hate more ugly; to a discontented and afflicted man the light of the day seems dark and overcast. Our senses are not only depraved, but very often stupefied by the passions of the soul; how many things do we see that we do not take notice of, if the mind be occupied with other thoughts?</p>
<blockquote>
  In rebus quoque apertis noscere possis,<br/>
  Si non advertas animum, proinde esse quasi omni<br/>
  Tempore semot fuerint, longeque remot:
  <br/><br/>
  Nay, even in plainest things, unless the mind<br/>
  Take heed, unless she sets herself to find,<br/>
  The thing no more is seen, no more belov'd,<br/>
  Than if the most obscure and most remov'd:
 </blockquote>
<p>it would appear that the soul retires within, and amuses the powers of the senses. And so both the inside and the outside of man is full of infirmity and falsehood.</p>
<p>They who have compared our lives to a dream were, perhaps, more in the right than they were aware of. When we dream, the soul lives, works, and exercises all its faculties, neither more nor less than when awake; but more largely and obscurely, yet not so much, neither, that the difference should be as great as betwixt night and the meridian brightness of the sun, but as betwixt night and shade; there she sleeps, here she slumbers; but, whether more or less, 'tis still dark, and Cimmerian darkness.  We wake sleeping, and sleep waking. I do not see so clearly in my sleep; but as to my being awake, I never found it clear enough and free from clouds; moreover, sleep, when it is profound, sometimes rocks even dreams themselves asleep; but our waking is never so sprightly that it rightly purges and dissipates those whimsies, which are waking dreams, and worse than dreams. Our reason and soul receiving those fancies and opinions that come in dreams, and authorizing the actions of our dreams with the like approbation that they do those of the day, wherefore do we not doubt whether our thought, our action, is not another sort of dreaming, and our waking a certain kind of sleep?</p>
<p>If the senses be our first judges, it is not ours that we are alone to consult; for, in this faculty, beasts have as great, or greater, than we; it is certain that some of them have the sense of hearing more quick than man; others that of seeing, others that of feeling, others that of touch and taste. Democritus said, that the gods and brutes had the sensitive faculties more perfect than man. But betwixt the effects of their senses and ours the difference is extreme. Our spittle cleanses and dries up our wounds; it kills the serpent:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  Tantaque in his rebas distantia differitasque est,<br/>
  Ut quod aliis cibus est, aliis fuat acre venenum.<br/>
  Spe etenim serpens, hominis contacta saliv,<br/>
  Disperit, ac sese mandendo conficit ipsa:
  <br/><br/>
  And in those things the difference is so great<br/>
  That what's one's poison is another's meat;<br/>
  For serpents often have been seen, 'tis said,<br/>
  When touch'd with human spittle, to go mad,<br/>
  And bite themselves to death:
 </blockquote>
<p>what quality shall we attribute to our spittle? as it affects ourselves, or as it affects the serpent? By which of the two senses shall we prove the true essence that we seek for?</p>
<p>Pliny says there are certain sea-hares in the Indies that are poison to us, and we to them; insomuch that, with the least touch, we kill them.  Which shall be truly poison, the man or the fish? Which shall we believe, the fish of the man, or the man of the fish? One quality of the air infects a man, that does the ox no harm; some other infects the ox, but hurts not the man. Which of the two shall, in truth and nature, be the pestilent quality? To them who have the jaundice, all things seem yellow and paler than to us:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  Lurida prterea fiunt, qucunque tuentur Arquati.
  <br/><br/>
  Besides, whatever jaundic'd eyes do view<br/>
  Looks pale as well as those, and yellow too.
 </blockquote>
<p>They who are troubled with the disease that the physicians call hyposphagma&mdash;which is a suffusion of blood under the skin&mdash;see all things red and bloody. What do we know but that these humours, which thus alter the operations of sight, predominate in beasts, and are usual with them? for we see some whose eyes are yellow, like us who have the jaundice; and others of a bloody colour; 'tis likely that the colours of objects seem other to them than to us. Which of the two shall make a right judgment? for it is not said that the essence of things has a relation to man only; hardness, whiteness, depth, and sharpness, have reference to the service and knowledge of animals as well as to us, and nature has equally designed them for their use. When we press down the eye, the body that we look upon we perceive to be longer and more extended;&mdash;many beasts have their eyes so pressed down; this length, therefore, is perhaps the true form of that body, and not that which our eyes give it in the usual state. If we close the lower part of the eye things appear double to us:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  Bina lucemarum fiorentia lumina flammis...<br/>
  Et duplices hominum facis, et corpora bina.
  <br/><br/>
  One lamp seems double, and the men appear<br/>
  Each on two bodies double heads to bear.
 </blockquote>
<p>If our ears be hindered, or the passage stopped with any thing, we receive the sound quite otherwise than we usually do; animals, likewise, who have either the ears hairy, or but a very little hole instead of an ear, do not, consequently, hear as we do, but receive another kind of sound. We see at festivals and theatres that, opposing a painted glass of a certain colour to the light of the flambeaux, all things in the place appear to us green, yellow, or violet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  Et vulgo faciunt id lutea russaque vela,<br/>
  Et ferrugina, cum, magnis intenta theatris,<br/>
  Per malos vulgata trabesque, trementia pendent;<br/>
  Namque ibi consessum caveai subter, et omnem<br/>
  Scenai speciem, patrum, matrumque, deorumque<br/>
  Inficiunt, coguntque suo volitare colore:
  <br/><br/>
  Thus when pale curtains, or the deeper red,<br/>
  O'er all the spacious theatre are spread,<br/>
  Which mighty masts and sturdy pillars bear,<br/>
  And the loose curtains wanton in the air;<br/>
  Whole streams of colours from the summit flow,<br/>
  The rays divide them in their passage through,<br/>
  And stain the scenes, and men, and gods below:
 </blockquote>
<p>'tis likely that the eyes of animals, which we see to be of divers colours, produce the appearance of bodies the same with their eyes.</p>
<p>We should, therefore, to make a right judgment of the oppositions of the senses, be first agreed with beasts, and secondly amongst ourselves; which we by no means are, but enter into dispute every time that one hears, sees, or tastes something otherwise than another does, and contests, as much as upon any other thing, about the diversity of the images that the senses represent to us. A child, by the ordinary rule of nature, hears, sees, and talks otherwise than a man of thirty years old; and he than one of threescore. The senses are, in some, more obscure and dusky, and more open and quick in others. We receive things variously, according as we are, and according as they appear to us. Those rings which are cut out in the form of feathers, which are called <em>endless feathers</em>, no eye can discern their size, or can keep itself from the deception that on one side they enlarge, and on the other contract, and come So a point, even when the ring is being turned round the finger; yet, when you feel them, they seem all of an equal size. Now, our perception being so uncertain and so controverted, it is no more a wonder if we are told that we may declare that snow appears white to us; but that to affirm that it is in its own essence really so is more than we are able to justify; and, this foundation being shaken, all the knowledge in the world must of necessity fall to ruin. What! do our senses themselves hinder one another? A picture seems raised and embossed to the sight; in the handling it seems flat to the touch. Shall we say that musk, which delights the smell, and is offensive to the taste, is agreeable or no? There are herbs and unguents proper for one part o the body, that are hurtful to another; honey is pleasant to the taste, but offensive to the sight. They who, to assist their lust, used in ancient times to make use of magnifying-glasses to represent the members they were to employ bigger, by that ocular tumidity to please themselves the more; to which of their senses did they give the prize,&mdash;whether to the sight, that represented the members as large and great as they would desire, or to the feeling, which represented them little and contemptible? Are they our senses that supply the subject with these different conditions, and have the subjects themselves, nevertheless, but one? As we see in the bread we eat, it is nothing but bread, but, by being eaten, it becomes bones, blood, flesh, hair; and nails:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  Ut cibus in membra atque artus cum diditur omnes,<br/>
  Disperit,, atque aliam naturam sufficit ex se;
  <br/><br/>
  As meats, diffus'd through all the members, lose<br/>
  Their former state, and different things compose;
 </blockquote>
<p>the humidity sucked up by the root of a tree becomes trunk, leaf, and fruit; and the air, being but one, is modulated, in a trumpet, to a thousand sorts of sounds; are they our senses, I would fain know, that, in like manner, form these subjects into so many divers qualities, or have they them really such in themselves? And upon this doubt what can we determine of their true essence? Moreover, since the accidents of disease, of raving, or sleep, make things appear otherwise to us than they do to the healthful, the wise, and those that are awake, is it not likely that our right posture of health and understanding, and our natural humours, have, also, wherewith to give a being to things that have a relation to their own condition, and accommodate them to themselves, as well as when they are disordered;&mdash;that health is as capable of giving them an aspect as sickness? Why has not the temperate a certain form of objects relative to it, as well as the intemperate? and why may it not as well stamp it with its own character as the other? He whose mouth is out of taste, says the wine is flat; the healthful man commends its flavour, and the thirsty its briskness. Now, our condition always accommodating things to itself, and transforming them according to its own posture, we cannot know what things truly are in themselves, seeing that nothing comes to us but what is falsified and altered by the senses. Where the compass, the square, and the rule, are crooked, all propositions drawn thence, and all buildings erected by those guides, must, of necessity, be also defective; the uncertainty of our senses renders every thing uncertain that they produce:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  Denique ut in fabric, si prava est rgula prima,<br/>
  Normaque si fallax rectis regionibus exit,<br/>
  Et libella aliqu si ex parte claudicat hilum;<br/>
  Omnia mendose fieri, atque obstipa necessum est,<br/>
  Prava, cubantia, prona, supina, atque absona tecta;<br/>
  Jam ruere ut qudam videantux'velle, ruantque<br/>
  Prodita judiciis fallacibus omnia primis;<br/>
  Sic igitur ratio tibi reram prava necesse est,<br/>
  Falsaque sit, falsis qucunque ab sensibus orta est.
  <br/><br/>
  But lastly, as in building, if the line<br/>
  Be not exact and straight, the rule decline,<br/>
  Or level false, how vain is the design!<br/>
  Uneven, an ill-shap'd and tottering wall<br/>
  Must rise; this part must sink, that part must fall,<br/>
  Because the rules were false that fashion'd all;<br/>
  Thus reason's rules are false if all commence<br/>
  And rise from failing and from erring sense.

<p>As to what remains, who can be fit to judge of and to determine those differences? As we say in controversies of religion that we must have a judge neither inclining to the one side nor the other, free from all choice and affection, which cannot be amongst Christians, just so it falls out in this; for if he be old he cannot judge of the sense of old age, being himself a party in the case; if young, there is the same exception; if healthful, sick, asleep, or awake, he is still the same incompetent judge. We must have some one exempt from all these propositions, as of things indifferent to him; and by this rule we must have a judge that never was.</p>
<p>To judge of the appearances that we receive of subjects, we ought t have a deciding instrument; to verify this instrument we must have demonstration; to verify this demonstration an instrument; and here we are round again upon the wheel, and no further advanced. Seeing the senses cannot determine our dispute, being full of uncertainty themselves, it must then be reason that must do it; but no reason can be erected upon any other foundation than that of another reason; and so we run back to all infinity. Our fancy does not apply itself to things that are strange, but is conceived by the mediation of the senses; and the senses do not comprehend a foreign subject, but only their own passions; by which means fancy and appearance are no part of the subject, but only of the passion and sufferance of sense; which passion and subject are different things; wherefore whoever judges by appearances judges by another thing than the subject. And to say that the passions of the senses convey to the soul the quality of foreign subjects by resemblance, how can the soul and understanding be assured of this resemblance, having of itself no commerce with foreign subjects? As they who never knew Socrates cannot, when they see his picture, say it is like him. Now, whoever would, notwithstanding, judge by appearances, if it be by all, it is impossible, because they hinder one another by their contrarieties and discrepancies, as we by experience see: shall some select appearances govern the rest? you must verify this select by another select, the second by a third, and thus there will never be any end to it. Finally, there is no constant existence, neither of the objects' being nor our own; both we, and our judgments, and all mortal things, are evermore incessantly running and rolling; and consequently nothing certain can be established from the one to the other, both the judging and the judged being in a continual motion and mutation.</p>
